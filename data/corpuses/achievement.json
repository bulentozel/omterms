Need for achievement \n N-Ach \n refers to an individual's desire for significant accomplishment mastering of skills control or high standards The term was first used by \n Henry Murray \n and associated with a range of actions These include \"intense prolonged and repeated efforts to accomplish something difficult To work with singleness of purpose towards a high and distant \n goal \n To have the determination to win\" The concept of N-Ach was subsequently popularised by the psychologist \n David McClelland \n This personality trait is characterized by an enduring and consistent concern with setting and meeting high standards of achievement This need is influenced by internal drive for action intrinsic motivation and the pressure exerted by the expectations of others extrinsic motivation Measured with the \n thematic apperception test \n TAT need for achievement motivates an individual to succeed in competition and to excel in activities important to him or her \n Need for Achievement is related to the difficulty of tasks people choose to undertake Those with low N-Ach may choose very easy tasks in order to minimise risk of failure or highly difficult tasks such that a failure would not be embarrassing Those with high N-Ach tend to choose moderately difficult tasks feeling that they are challenging but within reach \n People high in N-Ach are characterised by a tendency to seek challenges and a high degree of independence Their most satisfying reward is the recognition of their achievements Sources of high N-Ach include \n Parents who encouraged independence in \n childhood \n Praise and rewards for success \n Association of achievement with positive feelings \n Association of achievement with one's own competence and effort not luck \n A desire to be effective or challenged \n Intrapersonal Strength \n Desirability \n Feasibility \n Goal Setting Abilities \n In the work place organizations can find it hard to recognize those who are high in the N-Ach and those who are not When people who need and require the necessary attention for their efforts to be recognized by someone who is in an influential position to them if they do not receive the satisfaction or recognition they may become dissatisfied and frustrated with their work or position This can lead to a myriad of problems in job and self-resentment and disapproval \n This can be seen as a negative emotional reaction however in turn as we learned from David McClelland the need for achievement will take its course in different ways A person will either take small easy tasks that they know the can accomplish and be congratulated for or they will accept extremely challenging tasks for they fear not risk of embarrassment in failure due to the high demand of the procured undertaking It has been found that employees motivated by the need for achievement are typically more of the risk takers in the organization They are also the employees that want to constantly be challenged to learn new things \n These people tend to become very absorbed in their work This is why they require recognition when a task is completed \n So If a risk taker becomes dissatisfied due to the lack or appreciation for their work they teeter back and forth on the edge of a knife On either side is an enormous plunge and it can go either way The employee will either continue to work and take more risks and be creative and try harder to impress and gain recognition Or they will go find somewhere else to work In this manner employers managers colleagues and co-workers need to respect everyone who has a need for achievement personality and give them the credit they require to keep them happy This will lead to a productive happy and well established work force Here are some road blocks that those who have a high need for achievement David McClelland suggested other characteristics and attitudes of achievement-motivated people \n Achievement is more important than material or financial reward \n Achieving the aim or task gives greater personal satisfaction than receiving praise or recognition \n Financial reward is regarded as a measurement of success not an end in itself \n Security is not prime motivator nor is status \n Feedback is essential because it enables measurement of success not for reasons of praise or recognition the implication here is that feedback must be reliable quantifiable and factual \n Achievement-motivated people constantly seek improvements and ways of doing things better \n Theory \n Measurement \n Further reading \n Theory \n The pioneering research work of the Harvard Psychological Clinic in the 1930s summarized in \n Explorations in Personality \n provided the start point for future studies of personality especially those relating to needs and motives \n David C McClelland's \n and his associates' investigations of achievement motivation have particular relevance to the emergence of leadership McClelland was interested in the possibility of deliberately arousing a motive to achieve in an attempt to explain how individuals express their preferences for particular outcomesa general problem of motivation In this connection the need for achievement refers to an individual's preference for success under conditions of competition The vehicle \n McClelland \n employed to establish the presence of an achievement motive was the type of fantasy a person expressed on the \n Thematic Apperception Test \n TAT developed by Christiana Morgan and Henry Murray who note in \n Explorations in Personality \n that \" when a person interprets an ambiguous social situation he is apt to expose his own personality as much as the phenomenon to which he is attending Each picture should suggest some critical situation and be effective in evoking a fantasy relating to it\" p531 The test is composed of a series of pictures that subjects are asked to interpret and describe to the psychologist The TAT has been widely used to support assessment of needs and motives \n In McClelland published The Achieving Society which articulated his model of human motivation McClelland contended that three dominant needs -for achievement for power and for affiliation- underpin human motivation McClelland believed that the relative importance of each need varies among individuals and cultures Arguing that commonly used hiring tests using IQ and personality assessments were poor predictors of competency McClelland proposed that companies should base hiring decisions on demonstrated competency in relevant fields rather than on standardized test scores Iconoclastic in their time McClellands ideas have become standard practice in many corporations \n The procedure in McClelland's initial investigation was to arouse in the test audience a concern with their achievement A control group was used in which arousal was omitted In the course of this experiment McClelland discovered through analyzing the stories on the TAT that initial arousal was not necessary Instead members of the control group individuals who had had no prior arousal demonstrated significant differences in their stories some writing stories with a high achievement content and some submitting stories with a low achievement content Using results based on the \n Thematic Apperception Test \n McClelland demonstrated that individuals in a society can be grouped into high achievers and low achievers based on their scores on what he called \"N-Ach\" \n McClelland \n and his associates have since extended their work in fantasy analysis to include different age groups occupational groups and nationalities in their investigations of the strength of need for achievement These investigations have indicated that the N-Ach score increases with a rise in occupational level Invariably businessmen managers and entrepreneurs are high scorers Other investigations into the characteristics of the high achievers have revealed that accomplishment on the job represents an end in itself monetary rewards serve as an index of this accomplishment In addition these other studies found that the high achievers though identified as managers businessmen and entrepreneurs are not gamblers A high emotional intelligence calls for a high need for achievement while a low emotional intelligence calls for a lower need for achievement They will accept risk only to the degree they believe their personal contributions will make a difference in the final outcome \n An experiment realized to entry level managers of AT&T from to studied the level of achievement attained during a period of to years showing that High n-Achievement was associated with managerial success at lower levels of management jobs in which promotion depends more on individual contributions than it does at higher levels At the higher levels in which promotion depends on demonstrated ability to manage others a high n-Achievement is not associated with success by contrast the leadership motive pattern is so associated in all likelihood because it involves a high n-Power emerging as a concern for influencing people \n These explorations into the achievement motive seem to turn naturally into the investigation of national differences based on Max Weber's thesis that the industrialization and economic development of the Western nations were related to the Protestant ethic and its corresponding values supporting work and achievement McClelland and his associates have satisfied themselves that such a relationship viewed historically through an index of national power consumption indeed exists Differences related to individual as well as to national accomplishments depend on the presence or absence of an achievement motive in addition to economic resources or the infusion of financial assistance High achievers can be viewed as satisfying a need for self-actualization through accomplishments in their job assignments as a result of their particular knowledge their particular experiences and the particular environments in which they have lived \n Measurement \n The techniques McClelland and his collaborators developed to measure N-Ach \n N-Affil \n and \n N-Pow \n see McClelland et al can be viewed as a radical break with the dominant \n psychometric \n tradition However it should be recognized that McClelland's thinking was strongly influenced by the pioneering work of \n Henry Murray \n both in terms of Murray's model of human needs and motivational processes and his work with the OSS during World War Two It was during this period that Murray introduced the idea of \"situation tests\" and multi-rater / multi-method assessments It was Murray who first identified the significance of Need for Achievement Power and Affiliation and placed these in the context of an integrated motivational model \n Whilst trait-based personality theory assume that high-level competencies like initiative creativity and leadership can be assessed using \"internally consistent\" measures see \n psychometrics \n the McClelland measures recognize that such competencies are difficult and demanding activities which will neither be developed nor displayed unless people are undertaking activities they care about i e are strongly motivated to undertake Furthermore it is the cumulative number of independent but cumulative and substitutable components of competence they bring to bear while seeking to carry out these activities that will determine their success Accordingly the N-Ach N-Aff and N-Pow scoring systems simply count how many components of competence people bring to bear whilst carrying out activities they have a strong personal inclination or motivation to undertake \n McClellands research led him to formulate psychological characteristics of persons with strong need for achievement According to McClelland and David Winter \n Motivating Economic Achievement \n the following features accompany high level of achievement motivation \n Moderate risk propensity \n Undertaking innovative and engaging tasks \n Internal locus of control and responsibility for own decisions and behaviors \n Need for precise goal setting \n An important corollary is that there is no point in trying to assess people's abilities without first finding out what they care about So one cannot as some psychometricians try to do assess such things as \"creativity\" in any general sense One has always to ask \"creativity in relation to what?\" So McClelland's measures originally presented as means of assessing \"personality\" are best understood as means of measuring \n competence \n in ways which break radically with traditional \n psychometric \n approaches Everybody has different goals and needs for achievement based off many factors like past experiences education the risks and the feedback they will receive \n Need theory \n Need for power \n Need for affiliation \n Need for cognition \n Goal orientation"},

influence \n occurs when a person's emotions opinions or behaviors are affected by others \n Social influence takes many forms and can be seen in \n conformity \n socialization \n peer pressure \n obedience \n leadership \n persuasion \n sales \n and \n marketing \n In Harvard psychologist \n Herbert Kelman \n identified three broad varieties of social influence \n Compliance \n is when people appear to agree with others but actually keep their dissenting opinions private \n Identification \n is when people are influenced by someone who is liked and respected such as a famous celebrity \n Internalization \n is when people accept a belief or behavior and agree both publicly and privately \n Morton Deutsch and Harold Gerard described two psychological \n needs \n that lead humans to conform to the expectations of others These include our need to be right \n informational social influence \n and our need to be liked \n normative social influence \n Informational influence or \n social proof \n is an influence to accept information from another as evidence about reality Informational influence comes into play when people are uncertain either because stimuli are intrinsically ambiguous or because there is social disagreement Normative influence is an influence to conform to the positive expectations of others In terms of Kelman's typology normative influence leads to public compliance whereas informational influence leads to private acceptance \n Types \n Kelman's varieties \n Compliance \n Identification \n Internalization \n Conformity \n Minority influence \n Self-fulfilling prophecy \n Reactance \n Obedience \n Persuasion \n Psychological manipulation \n Antecedents \n Social impact theory \n Cialdini's \"weapons of influence\" \n Unanimity \n Status \n Culture \n Emotions \n Social structure \n Social networks \n Types \n Social Influence is a broad term that relates to many different phenomena Listed below are some major types of social influence that are being researched in the field of \n social psychology \n For more information follow the main article links provided \n Kelman's varieties \n There are three processes of \n attitude change \n as defined by Harvard psychologist \n Herbert Kelman \n in a paper published in the \n Journal of Conflict Resolution \n The purpose of defining these processes was to help determine the effects of social influence for example to separate public conformity behavior from private acceptance personal belief \n Compliance \n Compliance psychology \n Compliance is the act of responding favorably to an explicit or implicit request offered by others Technically compliance is a change in \n behavior \n but not necessarily in \n attitude \n one can comply due to mere \n obedience \n or by otherwise opting to withhold private thoughts due to social pressures \n According to Kelman's paper the satisfaction derived from compliance is due to the social effect of the accepting influence i e people comply for an expected reward or punishment-aversion \n Identification \n Identification psychology \n Identification is the changing of attitudes or behaviors due to the influence of someone who is admired \n Advertisements \n that rely upon \n celebrity \n endorsements to market their products are taking advantage of this phenomenon According to Kelman the desired relationship that the identifier relates to the behavior or attitude change \n Internalization \n Internalization \n Internalization is the process of acceptance of a set of norms established by people or groups that are influential to the individual The individual accepts the influence because the content of the influence accepted is intrinsically rewarding It is congruent with the individual's value system and according to Kelman the \"reward\" of internalization is \"the content of the new behavior\" \n Conformity \n Conformity \n Conformity is a type of social influence involving a change in behavior belief or thinking to align with those of others or with normative standards It is the most common and pervasive form of social influence \n Social psychology \n research in conformity tends to distinguish between two varieties \n informational conformity \n also called \n social proof \n or \"internalization\" in Kelman's terms and \n normative conformity \n \"compliance\" in Kelman's terms \n In the case of \n peer pressure \n a person is convinced to do something that they might not want to do such as taking \n illegal drugs \n but which they perceive as \"necessary\" to keep a positive \n relationship \n with other people such as their \n friends \n Conformity from peer pressure generally results from identification with the group members or from compliance of some members to appease others \n Conformity can be in appearance or may be more complete in nature impacting an individual both publicly and privately \n Compliance also referred to as acquiescence demonstrates a public conformity to a group majority or norm while the individual continues to privately disagree or dissent holding on to their original beliefs or to an alternative set of beliefs differing from the majority Compliance appears as conformity but there is a division between the public and the private self \n Conversion includes the private acceptance that is absent in compliance The individual's original behaviour beliefs or thinking changes to align with that of others the influencers both publicly and privately The individual has accepted the behavior belief or thinking and has internalized it making it his own Conversion may also refer to individual members of a group changing from their initial and varied opinions to adopt the opinions of others which may differ from their original opinions The resulting group position may be a hybrid of various aspects of individual initial opinions or it may be an alternative independent of the initial positions reached through consensus \n What appears to be conformity may in fact be congruence Congruence occurs when an individual's behavior belief or thinking is already aligned with that of the others and no change occurs \n In situations where conformity including compliance conversion and congruence is absent there are non-conformity processes such as independence and anti-conformity Independence also referred to as dissent involves an individual either through their actions or lack of action or through the public expression of their beliefs or thinking being aligned with their personal standards but inconsistent with those of other members of the group either all of the group or a majority Anti-conformity also referred to as counter-conformity may appear as independence but it lacks alignment with personal standards and is for the purpose of challenging the group Actions as well as stated opinions and beliefs are often diametrically opposed to that of the group norm or majority The underlying reasons for this type of behavior may be rebelliousness/obstinacy or it may be to ensure that all alternatives and view points are given due consideration \n Minority influence \n Minority influence \n Minority influence takes place when a majority is influenced to accept the beliefs or behaviors of a minority Minority influence can be affected by the sizes of majority and minority groups the level of consistency of the minority group and situational factors such as the affluence or social importance of the minority \n Minority influence most often operates through \n informational social influence \n as opposed to \n normative social influence \n because the majority may be indifferent to the liking of the minority \n Self-fulfilling prophecy \n Self-fulfilling prophecy \n A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true due to positive feedback between \n belief \n and \n behavior \n A prophecy declared as truth when it is actually false may sufficiently influence people either through fear or logical confusion so that their reactions ultimately fulfill the once-false prophecy This term is credited to \n sociologist \n Robert K Merton \n from an article he published in \n Reactance \n Reactance psychology \n Reactance is the adoption of a view contrary to the view that a person is being pressured to accept perhaps due to a perceived threat to behavioral freedoms This phenomenon has also been called \n anticonformity \n While the results are the opposite of what the influencer intended the reactive behavior is a result of \n social pressure \n It is notable that anticonformity does not necessarily mean \n independence \n In many studies reactance manifests itself in a deliberate rejection of an influence even if the influence is clearly correct \n Obedience \n Obedience human behavior \n Obedience is a form of social influence that derives from an authority figure The \n Milgram experiment \n Zimbardo's \n Stanford prison experiment \n and the \n Hofling hospital experiment \n are three particularly well-known experiments on obedience and they all conclude that humans are surprisingly obedient in the presence of perceived legitimate authority figures \n Persuasion \n Persuasion \n Persuasion is the process of guiding oneself or another toward the adoption of an attitude by rational or symbolic means \n Robert Cialdini \n defined six \"weapons of influence\" \n reciprocity \n commitment \n social proof \n authority \n liking and \n scarcity \n These \"weapons of influence\" attempt to bring about conformity by directed means Persuasion can occur through \n appeals to reason \n or \n appeals to emotion \n Psychological manipulation \n Psychological manipulation \n Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the behavior or \n perception \n of others through \n abusive \n deceptive \n or underhanded tactics \n By advancing the interests of the manipulator often at another's expense such methods could be considered exploitative abusive devious and deceptive \n Social influence is not necessarily negative For example doctors can try to \n persuade \n patients to change unhealthy habits Social influence is generally perceived to be harmless when it respects the right of the influenced to accept or reject it and is not unduly coercive Depending on the context and motivations social influence may constitute underhanded manipulation \n Antecedents \n Many factors can affect the impact of social influence \n Social impact theory \n Social impact theory \n Social impact theory was developed by \n Bibb Latan \n in This theory asserts that there are three factors which increase a person's likelihood to respond to social influence \n Strength \n The importance of the influencing group to the individual \n Immediacy \n Physical and temporal proximity of the influencing group to the individual at the time of the influence attempt \n Number \n The number of people in the group \n Cialdini's \"weapons of influence\" \n Robert Cialdini \n defines six \"weapons of influence\" that can contribute to an individual's propensity to be influenced by a persuader \n Reciprocity \n People tend to return a favor \n Commitment \n and \n consistency \n People do not like to be self-contradictory Once they commit to an idea or behavior they are averse to changing their minds without good reason \n Social proof \n People will be more open to things that they see others doing For example seeing others compost their organic waste after finishing a meal may influence the subject to do so as well \n Authority \n People will tend to obey authority figures \n Liking People are more easily swayed by people they like \n Scarcity \n A perceived limitation of resources will generate demand \n Unanimity \n Social Influence is strongest when the group perpetrating it is consistent and committed Even a single instance of dissent can greatly wane the strength of an influence For example in Milgram's first set of \n obedience experiments \n 65% of participants complied with fake authority figures to administer \"maximum shocks\" to a confederate In iterations of the Milgram experiment where three people administered shocks two of whom were confederates once one confederate disobeyed only ten percent of subjects administered the maximum shocks \n Status \n Appeal to authority \n Reputation \n Those perceived as \n experts \n may exert social influence as a result of their perceived expertise This involves \n credibility \n a tool of social influence from which one draws upon the notion of trust People believe an individual to be credible for a variety of reasons such as perceived experience attractiveness knowledge etc Additionally pressure to maintain one's reputation and not be viewed as fringe may increase the tendency to agree with the group This phenomenon is known as \n groupthink \n Appeals to authority may especially affect norms of \n obedience \n The compliance of normal humans to authority in the famous \n Milgram experiment \n demonstrate the \n power \n of perceived authority \n Those with access to the media may use this access in an attempt to influence the public For example a politician may use speeches to persuade the public to support issues that he or she does not have the power to impose on the public This is often referred to as using the \" \n bully pulpit \n \" Likewise celebrities don't usually possess any political power but they are familiar to many of the world's citizens and therefore possess \n social status \n Power is one of the biggest reasons an individual feels the need to follow through with the suggestions of another A person who possesses more authority or is perceived as being more powerful than others in a group is an icon or is most \"popular\" within a group This person has the most influence over others For example in a child's school life people who seem to control the perceptions of the students at school are most powerful in having a social influence over other children \n Culture \n Culture \n appears to play a role in the willingness of an individual to conform to the standards of a group \n Stanley Milgram \n found that conformity was higher in \n Norway \n than in \n France \n This has been attributed to Norway's longstanding tradition of social responsibility compared to France's cultural focus on individualism Japan likewise has a collectivist culture and thus a higher propensity to conformity However a \n Asch-style study \n found that when alienated Japanese students were more susceptible to \n anticonformity \n giving answers that were \n incorrect \n even when the group had collaborated on \n correct \n answers one third of the time significantly higher than has been seen in Asch studies in the past \n While \n gender \n does not significantly affect a person's likelihood to conform under certain conditions \n gender roles \n do affect such a likelihood Studies from the 1950s and 1960s concluded that women were more likely to conform than men But a study found that \n experimenter bias \n was involved all of the researchers were male while all of the research participants were female Studies thereafter found that the likelihood to conform almost equal between the genders Furthermore men conformed more often when faced with traditionally feminine topics and women conformed more often when presented with masculine topics In other words ignorance about a subject can lead a person to defer to \n \"social proof\" \n Emotions \n Appeal to emotion \n Emotion and disposition may affect an individual's likelihood of conformity or anticonformity \n In a study concluded that fear increases the chance of agreeing with a group while romance or lust increases the chance of going against the group \n Social structure \n Social networks \n Social network analysis \n A \n social network \n is a \n social structure \n made up of nodes representing individuals or organizations which are connected through \n ties \n also called \n edges \n connections \n or \n links \n by one or more types of interdependency such as friendship common interests or beliefs sexual relations or kinship \n Social network analysis \n uses the lens of \n network theory \n to examine \n social relationships \n Social network analysis as a field has become more prominent since the mid-20th century in determining the channels and effects of social influence For example \n Christakis \n and \n Fowler \n found that social networks transmit states and behaviors such as obesity \n smoking \n drinking \n and happiness \n Identifying the extent of social influence based on large-scale observational data with a latent \n social network \n structure is pertinent to a variety of collective social phenomena including \n crime \n civil unrest \n and \n voting behavior \n in elections For example methodologies for disentangling social influence by peers from external influenceswith latent social network structures and large-scale observational datawere applied to US presidential elections \n stock markets \n and \n civil unrest \n Authority bias \n Bystander effect \n Impression management \n Judgeadvisor system \n Mind shaping \n

orientation \n is an \"individual disposition toward developing or validating one's ability in achievement settings\" \n Previous research has examined \n goal \n orientation as a \n motivation \n variable useful for \n recruitment \n climate and culture \n performance appraisal \n and selection \n Studies have also used goal orientation to predict sales performance \n goal setting \n learning and adaptive behaviors in \n training \n and \n leadership \n Due to the many theoretical and practical applications of goal orientation it is important to understand the construct and how it relates to other variables In this entry goal orientation will be reviewed in terms of its history stability dimensionality antecedents its relationship to goal setting and consequences its relevance to motivation and future directions for research \n Historical perspective \n Early conceptualizations \n Recent conceptualizations \n State versus trait \n Types \n Communications \n Learning \n Learning-approach and learning-avoidance \n Prove performance \n Avoid performance \n Antecedents \n Cognitive ability \n Need for achievement \n Big Five personality characteristics \n Goal setting \n Consequences and outcomes \n Self-efficacy \n Metacognition \n Feedback seeking and interpretation \n Academic outcomes \n Organizational outcomes \n Learning environments \n Historical perspective \n Early conceptualizations \n The earliest conceptualizations of goal orientation were proposed in the 1970s by the educational psychologist J A Eison Eison \n argued that students who approached college as an opportunity to acquire new skills and knowledge possessed a learning orientation while students who approached college with the goal to exclusively obtain high grades possessed a grade orientation Eison originally believed that these two orientations were two ends of the same continuum and developed the Learning Orientation-Grade Orientation Scale to measure the continuum At about the same time J G Nicholls \n was developing a related theory that achievement motivation would lead grade school children to set high task related goals Nicholls \n found that when some high-ability children encountered difficult tasks they would use maladaptive strategies leading to eventual feelings of helplessness while others would use more productive \n coping strategies \n Nicholls later conceptualized these differences as two types of achievement goals a task involvement where individuals seek to develop their competence relative to their own abilities and b ego involvement where individuals seek to develop their competence relative to the abilities of others \n Nicholls's early work set up Dweck's \n proposition of two types of \n goal orientation \n learning orientation and performance orientation \n Dweck postulated that children with learning goals were believed to approach situations with the goal to master the acquisition of new skills while children with performance goals were believed to approach situations with the goal of gaining approval from peers and teachers Similar to Eison Dweck \n conceptualized goal orientation as a two-dimension construct Individuals with a learning goal orientation sometimes referred to as mastery goal orientation or abbreviated as LGO seek to develop their competence by acquiring new skills and mastering new situations They are not concerned about their performance relative to others but rather with furthering their understanding of a given topic or task \n Individuals with a performance goal orientation seek to demonstrate and validate the adequacy of their competence in order to receive favorable judgments and avoid negative judgments Although Dweck's work in this area built on the foundation laid by Nicholls the fundamental difference between the two scholars' works was the attribution of an individual's goal orientation Nicholls believed that the goal orientation held by an individual was a result of the possession of either an internal or external referent while Dweck considered the adoption of a particular goal orientation to be related to the theory of intelligence held by that individual \n Subsequent work by Eison and colleagues in led to a change in the conceptualization of these orientations from two ends of a continuum to two separate constructs \n More recently researchers have embraced the idea that individuals can adopt the two orientation style simultaneously persons can be high in both learning and performance orientations low in both learning and performance orientations or high in one orientation and low in the other Ultimately individuals can entertain multiple competing goal orientations at the same time striving to both outperform competitors and improve their own performance This led to the conceptualization of two separate continuums one for learning goal orientation and one for performance goal orientation \n Recent conceptualizations \n Just over a decade after Dweck conceptualized the two-factor model of goal orientation VandeWalle \n proposed that goal orientation is better conceptualized as a three-factor model further dividing performance goal orientation into the dimensions of avoidant performance goal orientation APGO and prove performance goal orientation PPGO APGO is centered on the goal of avoiding failure and negative judgment from others centered on lack of competence while PPGO is centered on demonstrating performance to prove competence Learning goal orientation has also been separated into two categories learning approach orientation and learning avoid orientation \n however this conceptualization is neither widely accepted nor substantially proven According to VandeWalle Cron & Slocum \n APGO and PPGO have differing relationships with various outcome variables supporting the argument that a three-factor model should be used in place of the originally conceptualized two-factor model \n State versus trait \n There has been great debate if goal orientation should be operationalized as a \n state \n or as a \n trait \n Throughout the goal orientation literature there are inconsistencies with regard to the conceptualization of the stability of the construct For example DeShon & Gillespie \n stated that in the literature goal orientation has been conceptualized as a trait quasi-trait and state They articulated that whether researchers conceptualize goal orientation as a trait or a state \"depends on the breadth of the inference that the researcher is attempting to support\" p \n State goal orientation refers to the goal one has in a particular situation It is similar to trait goal orientation in that it represents one's preference in an achievement situation However state goal orientation is \"specific to the task and context at hand\" p \n For example VandeWalle Cron & Slocum \n stated that goal orientation can be domain specific They stated that it is possible for an individual to have a strong learning goal orientation in their academic domain but not in their work domain Trait goal orientation refers to the \"consistent pattern of responses in achievement situations based on the individual's standing on goal orientation dimensions\" \n This view of goal orientation treats the construct as a stable individual difference characteristic Button Mathieu & Zajac \n take an integrative view of the construct stating that goal orientation is best categorized as a relatively stable individual difference variable that can be influenced by situational and contextual characteristics These authors found that when few situational cues are present individuals will adopt their dispositional goal orientations However when \"dispositional goal orientations predispose individuals to adopt particular response patterns across situations situational characteristics may cause them to adopt a different or less acute response pattern for a specific situation p \n Thus trait and state goal orientation interact so both operationalizations should be considered simultaneously \n Types \n Since the realization that performance goal orientation is best split into two separate parts researchers have conducted validation studies to demonstrate the statistical and conceptual distinction of these three dimensions to goal orientation Conceptual and empirical work by Elliot and Church \n and VandeWalle \n demonstrated that the factor structure of Goal Orientation does indeed lend itself to three distinct dimensions as summarized below An explanation of the learning-approach and learning-avoidance goal orientations are also included for completeness \n Communications \n In communications there is a theory that coincides with this overall concept The theory is titled the Theory of Goal-oriented communications The idea behind it is that when communicating if individuals are concentrated on the goal at hand rather than the communication itself it will lessen confusion Communication is not the goal in itself but something bigger getting a planned idea across \n Communication is a goal Oriented Communication can be effective if the sender and receiver both are awere of the goal of communication and there is congruence of their goals \n Learning \n VandeWalle defines learning goal orientation as the \"desire to develop the self by acquiring new skills mastering new situations and improving one's competence\" p \n Persons with learning goal orientation seek feedback on past performance to evaluate current performance These individuals focus on improving skills and acquiring knowledge and are less concerned with making mistakes Research shows that adoption of mastery goals leads to greater intrinsic motivation as opposed to performance approach or performance avoid which are associated with external motivation \n One area where this can be seen as important is in the area of curriculum design When designing learning environments for students it is important to create opportunities that promote learning goals as opposed to performance goals One possible implication for educators is the need to emphasize knowledge-centered classroom environments that encourage \"doing with understanding\" \n Learning-approach and learning-avoidance \n Although learning goal orientation is most commonly conceptualized as a single construct researchers have begun to make the approach and avoidance distinction that they have previously done with the performance goal orientation According to Elliot \n learning-approach goals \"entail striving to develop one's skills and abilities advance one's learning understand material or complete or master a task\" p This type of learning goal orientation is consistent with the way general learning goal orientation has been conceptualized previously Alternatively learning-avoidance goals \"entail striving to avoid losing one's skills and abilities or having their development stagnate forgetting what one has learned misunderstanding material or leaving a task incomplete or unmastered\" \n p Individuals are likely to pursue learning-avoidance goals when they feel that their skills or abilities are deteriorating For example an elderly individual may notice that his/her physical and mental capacity is declining and as a result may focus his/her goals on sustaining or improving these diminishing capacities \n Prove performance \n VandeWalle defines performance prove goal orientation as the \"desire to prove one's competence and to gain favorable judgments about it\" p \n The performance approach orientation represents a desire to achieve a high level of performance Persons with performance approach orientation seek positive reinforcement and feedback \n These individuals don't want to put forth a lot of effort unless they will be positively evaluated and tend to avoid tasks where they may make mistakes and therefore be poorly evaluated \n Avoid performance \n Finally VandeWalle defines avoid performance as the \"desire to avoid the disproving of one's competence and to avoid negative judgments about it\" p \n The performance avoid orientation represents a desire to avoid instances of low believes Persons with performance avoid orientation focus on avoiding situations in which they will receive evaluations or risk demonstrating lack of confidence Individuals high in fear of failure are more likely to adopt performance avoid goals \n Antecedents \n Throughout the goal orientation literature many studies have examined relationships between goal orientation and various antecedents These antecedents have been identified as having varying levels of importance In a meta-analysis by Payne and her colleagues \n both need for achievement and the \n Big Five personality traits \n were identified as important antecedents of goal orientation while cognitive ability was found to have almost no relationship with goal orientation The following sections go into more detail about each antecedent Payne and her colleagues did not distinguish between proximal and distal antecedents \n Cognitive ability \n Cognitive ability \n Research has produced mixed results when examining the relationship between cognitive ability and goal orientation For example Eison \n found that learning-oriented learning goal orientation students had higher levels of cognitive ability than grade-oriented performance goal orientation students However Dweck and her colleagues were unable to find any relationship between the constructs \n Although findings are mixed \"a substantial body of theory and research suggests motivational and ability traits are generally uncorrelated\" p \n In a \n meta-analysis \n by Payne and her colleagues \n cognitive ability and goal orientation were found to be independent constructs Accordingly individuals with high cognitive ability are equally likely to hold learning prove performance and avoid performance goal orientations These authors also found that LGO predicted job performance above and beyond cognitive ability \n Based on this research goal orientation rather than cognitive ability serves as useful tool for practitioners to use to predict job performance \n Need for achievement \n Need for achievement \n Need for achievement refers to the degree to which an individual \"maintains high standards\" and \"aspires to accomplish difficult tasks\" \n Goal orientation dimensions have been conceptualized as manifestations of Atkinson's need for achievement and need to avoid failure competence-relevant motives \n In a meta-analysis by Payne et al \n the authors found that need for achievement was positively correlated with LGO negatively associated with APGO and unrelated to PPGO Another interesting finding by these authors was that need for achievement correlated more strongly with LGO than the trait conscientiousness Although LGO and need for achievement were found to be strongly related the findings demonstrate that LGO is related to but not synonymous with need for achievement \n Big Five personality characteristics \n Big Five personality traits \n Extensive research has been done on personality and many researchers have agreed that personality is best conceptualized as a five-factor model the Big Five \n These traits include extraversion openness to experience emotional stability conscientiousness and agreeableness \n In a study by Zweig and Webster \n the relationship between the Big-Five personality traits and goal orientation was examined The authors found that goal orientation and the Big-Five personality traits are related yet distinct constructs They also found that personality factors combine to create people's various orientations toward learning and goals which in turn predict the types of tasks they will engage in In a meta-analysis by Payne et al \n goal orientation was found to predict job performance over and above the Big-Five \n Goal setting \n Goal setting \n Historically goal setting theory has primarily been concerned with performance goals Locke and Latham \n summarize years of goal setting research by stating that as long as an individual is committed to a goal and has the ability to achieve it specific high hard goals lead to a higher level of task performance than vague or easy goals However the vast majority of goal setting studies have been conducted with a specific performance goal and often in laboratory settings where the task was fairly simple It is possible that when tasks are more complex or require a long-term commitment adopting a learning goal may lead to higher performance Fan Meng Billings Litchfield and Kaplan \n found that the relationship between trait learning goal orientation and goal-setting was moderated by self-efficacy such that individuals high in learning goal orientation and self-efficacy set higher goal that those high in learning goal orientation but low in self-efficacy This finding suggests that while learning goal orientation can influence goal setting the relationship also depends on other factors such as the individual's level of self-efficacy Fan et al also found that learning and prove goal orientations facilitated challenge striving suggesting that either orientation can effectively facilitate motivation for goal attainment Another factor to consider when examining the relationship between goal orientation and goal setting is the level of complexity inherent in the situation or task In situations with more complex tasks it appears that \"do your best\" goals may actually lead to higher performance than specific goals It is possible that in complex tasks a specific difficult goal imposes greater cognitive demands on employees making it difficult for them to learn the complex task due to this increased pressure \n Kanfer and Ackerman \n found that in an air traffic controller simulation a highly complex task having a performance-outcome goal actually interfered with acquiring the knowledge necessary to perform the task People performed better when they were asked to do their best This suggests that adopting a learning orientation may be appropriate for complex tasks or in specific settings However it may be possible to set a specific difficult learning goal Latham and Brown \n found that when MBA students set specific difficult learning goals such as mastering complex course material they outperformed MBA students who set a performance goal for GPA Locke and Latham \n claim that creating a specific difficult learning goal in this type of situation facilitates meta-cognition which is particularly helpful in complex environments with limited guidance such as in an MBA program \n Consequences and outcomes \n The goal orientation literature has examined the relationships among goal orientation and various proximal e g self-efficacy metacognition & feedback seeking and distal consequences e g academic outcomes organizational outcomes In a meta-analysis by Payne and her colleagues \n the goal orientation dimensions were found to be more strongly related to the self-regulatory constructs i e self-efficacy metacognition & feedback seeking than the performance constructs i e academic and organizational performance They also found that APGO was the only dimension negatively related to the various outcomes Payne and her colleagues found that the learning strategies metacognition would likely fall into this category and self-efficacy are the most important proximal consequences of goal orientation followed by feedback seeking academic outcomes and organizational outcomes The following sections go into more detail about each consequence \n Self-efficacy \n Self-efficacy \n Bandura defined self-efficacy as \"a belief in one's ability to effectively perform and to exercise influence over events\" \n Individuals who are high in self-efficacy set more difficult goals exert more effort to achieve those goals and seek to learn from the processes of pursuing those goals \n In a meta-analysis by Payne et al \n self-efficacy was identified as a proximal outcome of goal orientation Similarly VandeWalle Cron & Slocum \n found that LGO was positively related to self-efficacy effort and goal setting level Since \"self-efficacy functions as a primary motivational mechanism by which goal orientation influences subsequent learning processes\" employees with higher levels of self-efficacy will exert more effort toward and learn more from task assignments p \n Metacognition \n Metacognition \n Metacognition is conceptualized as an individual's knowledge and regulation over one's own cognitions \n Individuals high in metacognitive awareness are skilled at monitoring their progress towards goals identifying their strengths and weaknesses and adjusting their learning strategies accordingly to achieve favorable outcomes \n Although there have been relatively few research studies conducted on the role of metacognition in leader development outcomes some studies have found that metacognition plays an important role in such outcomes For example Ford et al \n linked LGO and metacognitive activity and found that metacognitive activity was significantly related to knowledge acquisition post-training performance and self-efficacy In a study by Schmidt & Ford \n metacognitive activity was positively related to LGO as well as cognitive affective and skill based learning outcomes Similarly Bell and Kozlowski \n found that LGO was significantly related to metacognitive activity The National Research Council points out that it is important to remember that metacognitive skills can be taught and essential that teachers explicitly teach metacognitive skills across the curriculum in a variety of subject areas \n Feedback seeking and interpretation \n In an organizational context the extent to which employees actively seek feedback can positively influence job performance \n Goal orientation influences how individuals evaluate the costs and benefits of feedback-seeking opportunities \n According to VandeWalle \n when individuals have the opportunity to seek feedback they face a cognitive dilemma between the need for self-assessment and the need for self-enhancement Since individuals with a learning goal orientation are interested in developing competencies they are more likely to interpret feedback positively and thus engage in more feedback-seeking behaviors to enhance performance These individuals interpret feedback as valuable information about how to correct errors and improve future performance on a given task Conversely individuals with a performance goal orientation are likely to interpret feedback as \"evaluative and judgmental information about the self\" p \n and as a result are less likely to seek feedback Consequently individuals with high levels of learning goal orientation are more inclined to seek feedback while individuals with high levels of prove performance goal orientation or avoid performance goal orientation are less inclined to seek feedback VandeWalle & Cummings \n Academic outcomes \n As previously stated goal orientation refers to individuals' behavioral tendencies in achievement-oriented tasks Therefore it seems intuitive that goal orientation would be associated with various academic outcomes According to Payne et al \n learning goal orientation is positively associated with self-regulatory behaviors such as planning and goal setting which in turn are associated with academic performance Thus individuals with high levels of LGO are more likely to perform well on academic tasks than individuals with high levels of the PGO dimensions \n In addition research has also shown that students' motivation can predict both the quality of the engagement in academic learning as well as the degree to which they seek out or avoid challenging situations \n \"Goal-setting is a technique that is often employed in organization as part of traditional performance appraisals and broader performance management interventions \n \" Englebrecht Heine & Mahembe If all students are to move \"through the increasing challenges and academic rigors\" of school then their motivation to learn must be identified and nurtured \n Organizational outcomes \n Goal orientation has also been linked to organizational outcomes specifically \n job performance \n Payne et al \n found that individuals with high levels of trait and state LGO and low levels of trait APGO had better job performance They found that PPGO was unrelated to performance The authors also found that LGO predicted job performance above and beyond both cognitive ability and the Big Five personality characteristics This finding suggests that LGO is a valuable predictor of job performance and it may be in the best interest of organizations to create a climate in which learning is valued over performance In another study by VandeWalle Cron & Slocum \n the authors found that individuals with a learning goal orientation had higher sales performance than those with performance goal orientations This finding suggests that in order to be successful in organizational setting individuals must have the desire to develop their skills \n Learning environments \n Research has shown that goal orientation is linked to outcomes and performance \n Much of this research has been centered on outcomes in schools and job performance When examining research on learning environments and curriculum design one could argue that there is significant alignment with LGO and ideal learning environments When designing learning environments there are some essential principles that should be in place These principles were outlined by the National Research Council in their report entitled How People Learn Brain Mind Experience and School \n First classrooms and school need to be learner centered By this teachers need to be aware of the strengths skills attitudes and knowledge that students bring with them when they enter school This should include acknowledging cultural differences and creating a place for the inclusion of their everyday lived experiences in the classroom Second teachers should strive to create a knowledge-centered classroom by focusing on what is taught why it is taught and what competence or mastery looks like The emphasis here should be placed on learning with understanding One way students can demonstrate this understanding is by successfully transferring content and skills to novel situations and problems This also relates back to metacognitive skills that have been demonstrated to be linked to learning goal orientation Next it is important to remember that formative assessments are essential in learning environments This type of ongoing assessments allows teachers to assess where students are and design their instruction accordingly Lastly it is very important to look at the environment in which learning takes place The teacher wants to create an environment that nurtures a learning goal orientation as opposed to a performance goal orientation This means encouraging a community of learners who are willing to take risks and make mistakes for the sake of learning Teachers should create environments that emphasize mastery over performance Performance is primarily focused on learning in the moment and a demarcated demonstration of understanding Mastery implies skill development over a period of time that includes experience and practice Authentic learning occurs when students can not only demonstrate understanding but apply it in multiple settings and to novel situations or problems \n Adaptive

industry to refer to their people This image died out around the time of World War II as the industry started to avoid the word given the pejorative connotation it had acquired Literally translated from the \n Latin \n gerundive \n as \"things that must be disseminated\" in some cultures the term is neutral or even positive while in others the term has acquired a strong negative connotation The connotations of the term \"propaganda\" can also vary over time For example in \n Portuguese \n and some \n Spanish language \n speaking countries particularly in the \n Southern Cone \n the word \"propaganda\" usually refers to the most common manipulative media \"advertising\" \n Poster of the 19th-century \n Scandinavist \n movement \n In English \n propaganda \n was originally a neutral term for the dissemination of information in favor of any given cause During the 20th century however the term acquired a thoroughly negative meaning in western countries representing the intentional dissemination of often false but certainly \"compelling\" claims to support or justify political actions or ideologies According to \n Harold Lasswell \n the term began to fall out of favor due to growing public suspicion of propaganda in the wake of its use during World War I by the \n Creel Committee \n in the United States and the \n Ministry of Information \n in Britain Writing in Lasswell observed \"In democratic countries the official propaganda bureau was looked upon with genuine alarm for fear that it might be suborned to party and personal ends The outcry in the United States against Mr Creel's famous Bureau of Public Information or 'Inflammation' helped to din into the public mind the fact that propaganda existed The public's discovery of propaganda has led to a great of lamentation over it Propaganda has become an epithet of contempt and hate and the propagandists have sought protective coloration in such names as 'public relations council ' 'specialist in public education ' 'public relations adviser ' \" \n Types \n Identifying propaganda has always been a problem \n The main difficulties have involved differentiating propaganda from other types of \n persuasion \n and avoiding a \n biased \n approach Richard Alan Nelson provides a definition of the term \"Propaganda is neutrally defined as a systematic form of purposeful persuasion that attempts to influence the emotions attitudes opinions and actions of specified target audiences for \n ideological \n political or commercial purposes through the controlled transmission of one-sided messages which may or may not be factual via mass and direct media channels \" \n The definition focuses on the communicative process involved or more precisely on the purpose of the process and allow \"propaganda\" to be considered objectively and then interpreted as positive or negative behavior depending on the perspective of the viewer or listener \n Propaganda poster in \n North Korean \n primary school \n According to historian \n Zbynk Zeman \n propaganda is defined as either white grey or black White propaganda openly discloses its source and intent Grey propaganda has an ambiguous or non-disclosed source or intent Black propaganda purports to be published by the enemy or some organization besides its actual origins \n compare with \n black operation \n a type of clandestine operation in which the identity of the sponsoring government is hidden In scale these different types of propaganda can also be defined by the potential of true and correct information to compete with the propaganda For example opposition to white propaganda is often readily found and may slightly discredit the propaganda source Opposition to grey propaganda when revealed often by an inside source may create some level of public outcry Opposition to black propaganda is often unavailable and may be dangerous to reveal because public cognizance of black propaganda tactics and sources would undermine or backfire the very campaign the black propagandist supported \n Propaganda poster in North Korea \n The propagandist seeks to change the way people understand an issue or situation for the purpose of changing their actions and expectations in ways that are desirable to the interest group Propaganda in this sense serves as a corollary to \n censorship \n in which the same purpose is achieved not by filling people's minds with approved information but by preventing people from being confronted with opposing points of view What sets propaganda apart from other forms of advocacy is the willingness of the propagandist to change people's understanding through deception and confusion rather than persuasion and understanding The leaders of an organization know the information to be one sided or untrue but this may not be true for the rank and file members who help to disseminate the propaganda \n Religious \n Propaganda was often used to influence opinions and beliefs on religious issues particularly during the split between the \n Roman Catholic Church \n and the \n Protestant churches \n More in line with the religious roots of the term propaganda is also used widely in the debates about \n new religious movements \n NRMs both by people who defend them and by people who oppose them The latter pejoratively call these NRMs \n cults \n Anti-cult activists \n and \n Christian countercult activists \n accuse the leaders of what they consider cults of using propaganda extensively to recruit followers and keep them Some social scientists such as the late Jeffrey Hadden and \n CESNUR \n affiliated scholars accuse ex-members of \"cults\" and the \n anti-cult movement \n of making these unusual religious movements look bad without sufficient reasons \n Wartime \n A US Office for War Information poster uses \n stereotyped \n imagery to warn lazy American workers they are helping the Japanese war effort \n In postWorld War II usage of the word \"propaganda\" more typically refers to political or \n nationalist \n uses of these techniques or to the promotion of a set of ideas \n Propaganda is a powerful weapon in war it is used to dehumanize and create hatred toward a supposed enemy either internal or external by creating a false image in the mind of soldiers and citizens This can be done by using derogatory or racist terms e g the racist terms \"Jap\" and \"gook\" used during World War II and the \n Vietnam War \n respectively avoiding some words or language or by making allegations of enemy atrocities Most propaganda efforts in wartime require the home population to feel the enemy has inflicted an injustice which may be fictitious or may be based on facts e g the sinking of the passenger ship \n RMS Lusitania \n by the German Navy in World War I The home population must also believe that the cause of their nation in the war is just In NATO doctrine propaganda is defined as \"Any information ideas doctrines or special appeals disseminated to influence the opinion emotions attitudes or behaviour of any specified group in order to benefit the sponsor either directly or indirectly \" \n Within this perspective information provided does not need to be necessarily false but must be instead relevant to specific goals of the \"actor\" or \"system\" that performs it \n Propaganda is also one of the methods used in \n psychological warfare \n which may also involve \n false flag \n operations in which the identity of the operatives is depicted as those of an enemy nation e g The \n Bay of Pigs \n invasion used CIA planes painted in Cuban Air Force markings The term propaganda may also refer to false information meant to reinforce the mindsets of people who already believe as the propagandist wishes e g During the First World War the main purpose of British propaganda was to encourage men join the army and women to work in the countrys industry The propaganda posters were used because radios and TVs were not very common at that time \n The assumption is that if people believe something false they will constantly be assailed by doubts Since these doubts are unpleasant see \n cognitive dissonance \n people will be eager to have them extinguished and are therefore receptive to the reassurances of those in power For this reason propaganda is often addressed to people who are already sympathetic to the agenda or views being presented This process of reinforcement uses an individual's predisposition to self-select \"agreeable\" information sources as a mechanism for maintaining control over populations \n Britannia \n arm-in-arm with \n Uncle Sam \n symbolizes the British-American alliance in World War I \n Propaganda may be administered in insidious ways For instance disparaging \n disinformation \n about the history of certain groups or foreign countries may be encouraged or tolerated in the educational system Since few people actually double-check what they learn at school such disinformation will be repeated by journalists as well as parents thus reinforcing the idea that the disinformation item is really a \"well-known fact\" even though no one repeating the myth is able to point to an authoritative source The disinformation is then recycled in the media and in the educational system without the need for direct governmental intervention on the media Such permeating propaganda may be used for political goals by giving citizens a false impression of the quality or policies of their country they may be incited to reject certain proposals or certain remarks or ignore the experience of others \n In the Soviet Union during the Second World War the propaganda designed to encourage civilians was controlled by Stalin who insisted on a heavy-handed style that educated audiences easily saw was inauthentic On the other hand the unofficial rumours about German atrocities were well founded and convincing \n Stalin was a Georgian who spoke Russian with a heavy accent That would not do for a national hero so starting in the 1930s all new visual portraits of Stalin were retouched to erase his Georgian facial characteristics and make him a more generalized Soviet hero Only his eyes and famous mustache remained unaltered Zhores Medvedev and Roy Medvedev say his \"majestic new image was devised appropriately to depict the leader of all times and of all peoples \" \n Article of the \n International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \n prohibits any propaganda for war as well as any advocacy of national or religious hatred that constitutes \n incitement \n to discrimination hostility or violence by law \n Naturally the common people don't want war neither in Russia nor in England nor in America nor for that matter in Germany That is understood But after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders That is easy All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger It works the same way in any country \n Hermann Gring \n Advertising \n Propaganda shares techniques with \n advertising \n and \n public relations \n each of which can be thought of as propaganda that promotes a commercial product or shapes the perception of an organization person or brand \n World War I \n propaganda poster for enlistment in the \n U S Army \n Journalistic theory generally holds that news items should be objective giving the reader an accurate background and analysis of the subject at hand On the other hand advertisements evolved from the traditional commercial advertisements to include also a new type in the form of paid articles or broadcasts disguised as news These generally present an issue in a very subjective and often misleading light primarily meant to persuade rather than inform Normally they use only subtle \n propaganda techniques \n and not the more obvious ones used in traditional commercial advertisements If the reader believes that a paid advertisement is in fact a news item the message the advertiser is trying to communicate will be more easily \"believed\" or \"internalized\" Such advertisements are considered obvious examples of \"covert\" propaganda because they take on the appearance of objective information rather than the appearance of propaganda which is misleading Federal law specifically mandates that any advertisement appearing in the format of a news item must state that the item is in fact a paid advertisement \n Politics \n Propaganda has become more common in \n political \n contexts in particular to refer to certain efforts sponsored by governments political groups but also often covert interests In the early 20th century propaganda was exemplified in the form of party slogans Propaganda also has much in common with \n public information \n campaigns by governments which are intended to encourage or discourage certain forms of behavior such as wearing seat belts not smoking not littering and so forth Again the emphasis is more political in propaganda Propaganda can take the form of \n leaflets \n posters TV and radio broadcasts and can also extend to any other \n medium \n In the case of the United States there is also an important legal imposed by law distinction between advertising a type of \n overt propaganda \n and what the Government Accountability Office GAO an arm of the United States Congress refers to as \"covert propaganda\" \n Roderick Hindery argues \n that propaganda exists on the political left and right and in mainstream centrist parties Hindery further argues that debates about most social issues can be productively revisited in the context of asking \"what is or is not propaganda?\" Not to be overlooked is the link between propaganda indoctrination and terrorism/counterterrorism He argues that threats to destroy are often as socially disruptive as physical

communication either directly or indirectly because a United States domestic audience is or may be thereby exposed to program material or based on a presumption of such exposure Public concerns were raised upon passage due to the relaxation of prohibitions of domestic propaganda in the United States \n Workplace propaganda \n The ease of data collection emerging from the IT revolution and a lack of control on the acquired data's use has led to the widespread implementation of workplace propaganda created much more locally such as in schools hospitals local retail outlets and Universities \n The same article also notes a departure from the traditional methodology of propagandists i e the use of emotionally provocative imagery to distort facts Workplace propaganda is suggested to use 'distorted data' to overrule emotion For example workplace propaganda may provide rationales for ideologically driven pay cuts \n Techniques \n Further information \n Propaganda techniques \n Anti-capitalist \n propaganda \n Common media for transmitting propaganda messages include news reports government reports historical revision \n junk science \n books leaflets \n movies \n radio television and posters Some propaganda campaigns follow a strategic transmission pattern to \n indoctrinate \n the target group This may begin with a simple transmission such as a leaflet or advertisement dropped from a plane or an advertisement Generally these messages will contain directions on how to obtain more information via a web site hot line radio program etc as it is seen also for selling purposes among other goals The strategy intends to initiate the individual from information recipient to information seeker through reinforcement and then from information seeker to \n opinion leader \n through indoctrination \n A number of techniques based in \n social psychological \n research are used to generate propaganda Many of these same techniques can be found under \n logical fallacies \n since propagandists use arguments that while sometimes convincing are not necessarily valid \n Some time has been spent analyzing the means by which the propaganda messages are

system \n A \n judgeadvisor system \n JAS \n is a type of advice structure often studied in \n advice \n taking research a subset of \n decision-making \n in the social sciences The two roles in a JAS are the judge and advisor roles The judge is the decision maker who evaluates information concerning a particular decision and makes the final judgment on the decision outcome The advisor is an individual who provides advice information or suggestions to the judge \n A key component of the dynamics in a JAS is the differentiation between the two roles in that while the advisor provides input to the decision actual decision-making power resides solely with the judge This one person decision power differentiates the JAS and related models such as Hollenbeck's Hierarchical Decision-Making Team model \n from more widely studied models where the final decision is mutually decided upon by the team as a whole \n While JASs can be most easily thought of as between superiors and subordinates such as in studentadvisor or workermanager relationships differential social or power standings are not necessary All that is required is that only one individual the judge has the final say in the decision outcome all other input given to the judge may be taken under consideration but need not be acted on Therefore even a situation where a friend receives advice from a peer can be considered a JAS \n Though examples of JASs are prevalent in real world settings they are studied most frequently in laboratory experiments in which judge/advisor roles are \n randomly assigned \n and situations/variables are manipulated at a between-subjects level \n Such manipulations allow for systematic study of the factors that affect how a judge reacts and responds to advisor advice \n Advice utilization \n Antecedents to advice utilization \n Judge decision-making style \n Decision-making competence \n Trust and confidence \n Type of advice \n Task type \n Solicitation of advice \n Other factors contributing to advice utilization \n Financial \n Advisor characteristics \n Task difficulty \n Consequences of advice utilization \n Accuracy of judge's final decision \n Judge's confidence in final decision \n Applications \n Future research directions \n Advice utilization \n Advice utilization is the degree to which judges take advisor advice into consideration in their final decision outcome and advice discounting is any effect that lowers the degree of advice utilization Both of these terms are frequently used interchangeably in JAS literature as they are related in opposition to one another i e advice discounting is a lack of advice utilization The amount of utilization is one of the most considered outcomes of a JAS decision process and depends on all the types of inputs described below In addition to these inputs there are theories for other sources of advice discounting in decision-making literature three of the most dominant theories are differential information \n anchoring \n and \n egocentric bias \n The differential information theory proposes that advice discounting stems from the fact that unlike with peoples own opinions they are not aware of advisors internal reasons for their opinions and so are less apt to fully accept them \n The second theory \n anchoring \n suggests that people use their own opinion as the starting point for their choice and only use advisor input to a certain extent that will adjust their initial position up or down \n The third theory \n egocentric bias \n proposes advice discounting happens due to judges believing they are superior to others so weigh their own opinion stronger than inputs from any other source \n In JAS literature one of the most robust advice discounting classification is egocentric advice discounting \n which draws conceptually from the basic theories of anchoring and egocentric bias Simply put egocentric advice discounting is the tendency of individuals to prefer advice and opinions that closely align to their own opinions formed prior to hearing any input Therefore judges tend to overly weigh advice from advisors that is similar to their own viewpoint regardless of what sort of expertise an advisor appears to have Conversely if the advice given is very dissimilar to the judges initial opinions that advice will be discounted much more than should be justified given the advisors level of expertise \n Antecedents to advice utilization \n Judge decision-making style \n Decision-making style refers to differences in the ways individuals approach decision tasks and respond to situations \n In a JAS judges differing styles can affect the way they accept and respond to advisor advice Five styles identified by Scott and Bruce are rational intuitive dependent spontaneous and avoidant \n Rational relying on logical evaluations and exhaustive searches for all relevant information \n Intuitive relying on intuition hunches and other intangibles \n Dependent relying on others for advice and direction \n Spontaneous relying on a strong urge to make decisions as soon as possible \n Avoidant relying on strategies for putting off the decision-making process as long as possible \n These styles are not mutually exclusive within an individual but there are discernible pattern differences across people \n While not explicitly examined in many JAS studies an understanding of these decision-making style differences can inform future understanding of advice-taking dynamics \n Decision-making competence \n Judges may differ in their susceptibility to a number of different errors in decision-making these characteristic differences are considered their specific decision-making competencies While decision-making competency has been broken down into categories in several different ways one of the most widely accepted frameworks is the Adult Decision-Making Competence scale A-DMC developed by Bruine de Bruin et al \n The A-DMC consists of categories of decision-making competencies that include dimensions such as Resistance to \n Framing \n and Recognizing \n Social Norms \n see Bruine de Bruin et al for a full description Weaknesses in these different areas make judges more susceptible to particular errors in judgment and may influence the way advisor input is received and acted upon \n Trust and confidence \n The level of trust a judge has with an advisor is directly related to the degree to which advice is taken into account When judges trust their advisors they are more likely to accept the advice given to them all other factors being equal \n Note that the trust relationship in a JAS is frequently unbalanced due to the greater importance of trust for the judge than the advisor This results because the judge must place a certain amount of trust in the advisors in order to utilize their advice in the decision which only the judge is ultimately responsible for Advisors on the other hand typically need not trust a judge in order to simply relay a suggestion or information Given this dynamic considerations of trust levels need only be made from the judges and not the advisors perspective Key influencers of JAS trust levels include perceived advisor confidence and subject expertise \n Type of advice \n The type of advice given by an advisor can influence the way it is received by the judge In a JAS the concept of advice needs to be broader than the typical definition of a recommendation for a particular outcome in a decision situation While this sort of input is certainly one kind of advice other types of advice also exist Dalal and Bonaccio suggest that there are different kinds of advice \n Recommendation for advice in favor of a particular alternative \n Recommendation against advice against one or more alternatives \n Information neutral advice giving more information about the alternatives without suggesting a particular one \n Decision Support no specific outcome advice instead input or support to guide the judges decision-making process \n Judges react to these four types of advice with differential preferences While specifics of the particular type of decision task and the judges individual differences can affect the degree of preference between types initial research shows Information-type advice to be most preferred \n This sort of advice has been little recognized in much of the past advice-taking literature and is expected to receive more attention in the future \n Task type \n Difficulty of the decision task influences the extent judges rely on advisor inputs When a difficult task is given to a judge there is a tendency to over-rely on the advice received from advisors conversely judges tend to rely less than they should on advisor information when the task seems relatively easy \n For example if judges need to make a decision about which stocks will be best performers based on complex financial data they are given they will be likely to defer to the advice of their advisors regardless of their supposed expertise since the judge's own grasp of the situation is so low However if the decision task seems more straightforward or simple to the judges they will be far likelier to weigh their own opinions more heavily than their advisors inputs regardless of the states of expertise the advisors have \n While the most often used decision tasks in JAS literature are ones that involve picking the right or best option an entirely different kind of decision to consider is one involving a choice based on taste or preference These situations come up frequently in life and are part of almost every consumer decision about the kind of music to buy clothes to wear or restaurants to visit Though less explored in JAS literature Yaniv et al provided evidence that in these situations of preference similarity of the advisor to the judge is the strongest predictor of how much the judge will accept the advice \n This similarity can be either in regard to a previous history of the advisor having similar preferences in a given category e g they rate the same kinds of songs highly or relating to basic demographic characteristics e g they are around the same age \n Solicitation of advice \n Advice from an advisor can be either solicited the judge seeks out input or unsolicited input is given automatically without being requested The degree of advice utilization has been shown to be influenced by which of these two situations is true for the decision situation at hand As may be expected by conventional wisdom advice utilization is typically higher for solicited versus unsolicited advice \n When people seek out advice it is implied that they are open to considering opinions other than their own and prone to higher advice utilization Conversely unsolicited advice can be seen as intrusive or as a type of criticism from the advisor about the judges competency \n Other factors contributing to advice utilization \n Financial \n Several characteristics of the decision task or judgeadvisor relationship have been shown to decrease the effect of egocentric discounting First if there is a financial incentive for making the correct or best decision judges tend to rely more heavily on their advisors \n Similarly when judges must pay for advice that input is taken much more into account than when it is freely given \n The effect of paying for advice is thought to have foundations in the economic theory of \n sunk costs \n Advisor characteristics \n In situations where the judges perceive the advisors to have expert knowledge the advice received is taken into account more regardless of similarity to the judges own opinions \n This finding is intuitive the less someone knows about a situation in relationship to their advisor the more likely they are to take that persons advice into account Advisor characteristics commonly associated with superior knowledge such as being older more educated or more experienced also have been shown to decrease egocentric discounting in decision-making situations \n Task difficulty \n Beyond advisor characteristics and financial factors the nature of the decision task itself can influence the degree to which advice is accepted In relatively easy tasks judges tend to consider advisor input to a lesser degree than they should based on the known expertise of the advisor Similarly when presented with a very difficult task judges tend to over-rely on the advisor inputs \n This dynamic is important to keep in mind when trying to identify real-world situations where people are vulnerable to being extremely influenced by people posing as experts \n Consequences of advice utilization \n Accuracy of judge's final decision \n Decision-making outcomes in a JAS or other advice-giving structures have been widely shown to be more accurate than those from situations with isolated decision makers \n This result should be expected given that advice situations often allow judges access to knowledge above and beyond what they could have as an individual When judges have access to multiple advisors with different information sources their decision accuracy improves even more \n A potential reason for this is due to the averaging across advisors that the judge does when integrating the different pieces of advice Like in \n forecasting \n the individual variations between advice become less pronounced and judges are left with more definitive advice that has the strength of consensus behind it \n Judge's confidence in final decision \n There are several key aspects of the JAS system that influence the degree to which the judge has confidence in his decision being accurate or correct The amount of agreement between advisors has been shown to affect judges' confidence in their decision such that higher disagreement between advisors is associated with low confidence \n Another factor that has demonstrated influence over judge confidence is the amount of effort the judge must put forth to understand and react to the advice proffered by the advisors As effort to process and comprehend advice increases so does a judge's overall confidence in their final decision \n Lastly it was found that judges could actually become overconfident in their decisions when having to rely almost completely on advisor recommendations due to not possessing nearly enough task-specific information themselves \n Applications \n Examples of judgeadvisor systems can be found in many real-world situations A recent example of an important JAS situation was that of the controversy around the federal loan guarantees to the now-bankrupt \n Solyndra \n In this situation as in many other situations that reach the presidential office there are many sources of diverse advice that the president and other decision-makers receive For example both the director of the National Economic Council and the Treasury secretary advised the president that they believed the selection guidelines were not thorough enough and might allow for funding of unnecessary risky companies However the Energy Secretary under pressure from congress advised the president to actually speed up loans and decrease scrutiny on the selection process As demonstrated by several studies advisors with differing viewpoints and differing degrees of unique information can interact with decision-makers in complex and sometimes detrimental ways \n The decision-makers are then in the difficult position of aggregating all this advice and making the most informed policy decision As with the Solyndra controversy these decisions can sometimes fall under great scrutiny and not produce the most effective solution \n JAS situations can also arise in more common settings that typical individuals can experience A very common JAS arises when individuals receive advice from doctors and other medical professionals For example an individual with diabetes might receive specific advice about better controlling their blood sugar after a situation that required that they go to the hospital That individual then may seek second opinions about that advice before coming to a decision regarding whether or not they will change their behavior to fit more with those recommendations As is found in the JAS research people often do not fully utilize doctors' recommendations often to their own detriment \n In each of these situations being able to figure out the way to make the advice system most efficient and productive has clear benefits Understanding the most effective ways to give advice has great potential in training programs for advisors mentors and in management training as a whole An example of such application is seen in the work by Wilkins et al on the development of the Raven and CoRaven decision-making aids used by the military to filter and represent massive amounts of battlefield data for strategic planning \n Using principles derived from JAS research the authors were able to analyze and better understand the aids with the result being a more effective system that makes battlefield decision-making less of a risky process In this situation the researchers treated the intelligent software as an advisor and the commanding officer as the judge Under this assumption the researchers then applied past and current JAS research findings to critically evaluate the software with the hopes of improving its functionality This utilization of JAS research is an example of one of the most promising and direct applications of the paradigm- \n collaborative technology \n which can facilitate decision-making processes that are too complex for human cognition alone \n Judge advisor systems research can also be applied to business finance education and many other fields in which hierarchical group-decision making is common Applications of such research could be used to make time-sensitive decisions in high-impact situations such as emergency rooms more efficient and accurate potentially saving the lives of patients in need The JAS framework could be effectively applied in public affairs to increase the speed at which new policies are created and enacted Other direct and indirect applications are possible for virtually every situation in which hierarchical group decision-making exists \n Future research directions \n JAS research is still a developing field with growth needed in a couple key areas One area of interest is a deeper understanding about the motives of decision-makers in JAS situations beyond decision accuracy and autonomy \n In the real world decision-makers frequently have many motives beyond making the most accurate and informed decision often due to social influences Some additional motives that have already been cited include attempting to diffuse responsibility for a decision \n minimizing the amount of effort on behalf of the decision-maker \n and maintaining good rapport with the advisor s \n As mentioned previously a less-explored subject matter that has surfaced in the JAS literature pertains to decisions regarding matters of taste \n Due to the relative newness of this work there is ample opportunity for further research New questions raised by this research include the effect of \n normative influences \n on taste preferences and hot-cold \n empathy gaps \n i e individuals preference for a certain food in a not hungry versus hungry state \n Finally one major topic that has been cited as needing further study is extending the context of decision-making beyond what has already been observed to see how these contexts affect the JAS \n This research area is related to concerns about the generalizability of many JAS studies to real-world decision-making situations in other words that the stimuli in controlled lab settings are impoverished compared to the stimuli individuals experience in their own lives \n Thus there has been a call for research that replicates previous findings in a more rich situational context \n Legal advisor \n Social sciences \n Industrial and organizational psychology \n

factors that govern impression management can be identified It can be stated that impression management becomes necessary whenever there exists a kind of social situation whether real or imaginary Logically the awareness of being a potential subject of monitoring is also crucial Furthermore the characteristics of a given social situation are important Specifically the surrounding \n cultural norms \n determine the appropriateness of particular nonverbal behaviours \n The actions have to be appropriate to the targets and within that culture so that the kind of audience as well as the relation to the audience influences the way impression management is realized A person's goals are another factor governing the ways and strategies of impression management This refers to the content of an assertion which also leads to distinct ways of presentation of aspects of the self The degree of self-efficacy describes whether a person is convinced that it is possible to convey the intended impression \n A new study finds that all other things being equal people are more likely to pay attention to faces that have been associated with negative gossip than those with neutral or positive associations The study contributes to a body of work showing that far from being objective human perceptions are shaped by unconscious brain processes that determine what they \"choose\" to see or ignoreeven before they become aware of it The findings also add to the idea that the brain evolved to be particularly sensitive to \"bad guys\" or cheatersfellow humans who undermine social life by deception theft or other non-cooperative behavior \n There are many methods behind self-presentation including \n self disclosure \n identifying what makes you \"you\" to another person managing appearances trying to fit in ingratiation aligning actions making one's actions seem appealing or understandable and alter-casting imposing identities on other people These self-presentation methods can also be used on the corporate level as impression management \n Self-presentation \n Self-presentation is conveying information about oneself or an image of oneself to others There are two types and motivations of self-presentation \n presentation meant to match one's own self-image and \n presentation meant to match audience expectations and preferences \n Self-presentation is expressive Individuals construct an image of themselves to claim personal identity and present themselves in a manner that is consistent with that image \n If they feel like it is restricted they often exhibit \n reactance \n or become defiant try to assert their freedom against those who would seek to curtail self-presentation expressiveness An example of this dynamic is the \"preacher's daughter\" whose suppressed personal identity and emotions cause an eventual backlash at her family and community \n Boasting \n Millon \n notes that in self-presentation individuals are challenged to balance boasting against discrediting themselves via excessive self-promotion or being caught and being proven wrong Individuals often have limited ability to perceive how their efforts impact their acceptance and likeability by others \n Flattery \n Flattery \n or \n praise \n to increase social attractiveness \n Intimidation \n aggressively showing \n anger \n to get others to hear and obey one's demands \n Self-presentation can be either defensive or assertive strategies Whereas defensive strategies include behaviours like avoidance of threatening situations or means of \n self-handicapping \n assertive \n strategies refer to more active behaviour like the verbal idealisation of the self the use of status symbols or similar practices \n These strategies play important roles in one's maintenance of \n self-esteem \n One's self-esteem is affected by their evaluation of their own performance and their perception of how others react to their performance As a result people actively portray impressions that will elicit self-esteem enhancing reactions from others \n Social interaction \n Goffman argued in his book \n Interaction ritual \n that people participate in social interactions by performing a \"line\" or \"pattern of verbal and nonverbal acts\" which is created and maintained by both the performer and the audience \n By enacting a line effectively the person gains positive social value which is also called \"face\" The success of a social interaction will depend on whether the performer has the ability to maintain face \n As a result a person is required to display a kind of character by becoming \"someone who can be relied upon to maintain himself as an interactant poised for communication and to act so that others do not endanger themselves by presenting themselves as interactants to him\" \n When Goffman turned to focus on people physically presented in a social interaction the \"social dimension of impression management certainly extends beyond the specific place and time of engagement in the organization\" Impression management is \"a social activity that has individual and community implications\" \n We call it \"pride\" when a person displays a good showing from duty to himself while we call it \"honor\" when he \"does so because of duty to wider social units and receives support from these duties in doing so\" \n Another approach to moral standards that Goffman pursues is the notion of \"rules of conduct\" which \"can be partially understood as obligations or moral constraints\" These rules may be substantive involving laws morality and ethics or ceremonial involving etiquette \n Rules of conduct play an important role when a relationship \"is asymmetrical and the expectations of one person toward another are hierarchical \" \n Dramaturgical analogy \n Goffman presented impression management \n dramaturgically \n explaining the motivations behind complex human performances within a social setting based on a play metaphor \n Goffman's work incorporates aspects of a symbolic \n interactionist \n perspective \n emphasizing a qualitative analysis of the interactive nature of the communication process Impression management requires the physical presence of others Performers who seek certain ends in their interest must \"work to adapt their behavior in such a way as to give off the correct impression to a particular audience\" and \"implicitly ask that the audience take their performance seriously\" \n The actor shaped by the environment and target audience sees interaction as a performance The objective of the performance is to provide the audience with an impression consistent with the desired goals of the actor \n Thus impression management is also highly dependent on the situation \n In addition to these goals individuals differ in responses from the interactive environment some may be non-responsive to an audience's reactions while others actively respond to audience reactions in order to elicit positive results These differences in response towards the environment and target audience are called \n self-monitoring \n Another factor in impression management is \n self-verification \n the act of conforming the audience to the person's \n self-concept \n The audience can be real or imaginary IM style norms part of the mental programming received through socialization are so fundamental that we usually do not notice our expectations of them While an actor speaker tries to project a desired image an audience listener might attribute a resonant or discordant image An example is provided by situations in which embarrassment occurs and threatens the image of a participant \n Goffman proposes that performers \"can use dramaturgical discipline as a defense to ensure that the 'show' goes on without interruption \" \n Goffman contends that dramaturgical discipline includes \n coping with dramaturgical contingencies \n demonstrating intellectual and emotional involvement \n remembering one's part and not committing unmeant gestures or faux pas \n not giving away secrets involuntarily \n covering up inappropriate behavior on the part of teammates on the spur of the moment \n offering plausible reasons or deep apologies for disruptive events \n maintaining self-control for example speaking briefly and modestly \n suppressing emotions to private problems and \n suppressing spontaneous feelings \n Manipulation and ethics \n In business \"managing impressions\" normally \"involves someone trying to control the image that a significant stakeholder has of them\" The ethics of impression management has been hotly debated on whether we should see it as an effective self-revelation or as cynical \n manipulation \n Some people insist that impression management can reveal a truer version of the self by adopting the strategy of being \n transparent \n which is a kind of openness Because \n transparency \n \"can be provided so easily and because it produces information of value to the audience it changes the nature of impression management from being cynically manipulative to being a kind of useful adaptation\" \n Virtue signalling \n is used within groups to criticize their own members for valuing outward appearance over substantive action having a real or permanent rather than apparent or temporary existence \n Psychological manipulation \n is a type of \n social influence \n that aims to change the behavior or \n perception \n of others through \n abusive \n deceptive \n or underhanded tactics \n By advancing the interests of the manipulator often at another's expense such methods could be considered exploitative abusive devious and deceptive The process of manipulation involves bringing an unknowing victim under the domination of the manipulator often using deception and using the victim to serve their own purposes \n Machiavellianism \n is a term that some social and personality psychologists use to describe a person's tendency to be unemotional and therefore able to detach him or herself from conventional morality and hence to deceive and manipulate others \n Machiavellianism in the workplace \n In modern usage \n sophism \n sophist and sophistry are redefined and used disparagingly A sophism is a \n specious \n argument for displaying ingenuity in reasoning or for deceiving someone A sophist is a person who reasons with clever but fallacious and deceptive arguments \n Application \n Face-to-face communication \n Self social identity and social interaction \n The social psychologist Edward E Jones brought the study of impression management to the field of psychology during the 1960s and extended it to include people's attempts to control others' impression of their personal characteristics \n His work sparked an increased attention towards impression management as a fundamental interpersonal process \n The concept of \n self \n is important to the theory of impression management as the images people have of themselves shape and are shaped by social interactions \n Our self-concept develops from social experience early in life \n Schlenker further suggests that children anticipate the effect that their behaviours will have on others and how others will evaluate them They control the impressions they might form on others and in doing so they control the outcomes they obtain from social interactions \n Social identity \n refers to how people are defined and regarded in social interactions \n Individuals use impression management strategies to influence the social identity they project to others \n The identity that people establish influences their behaviour in front of others others' treatment of them and the outcomes they receive Therefore in their attempts to influence the impressions others form of themselves a person plays an important role in affecting his social outcomes \n Social interaction is the process by which we act and react to those around us In a nutshell social interaction includes those acts people perform toward each other and the responses they give in return \n The most basic function of self-presentation is to define the nature of a social situation Goffman Most social interactions are very role governed Each person has a role to play and the interaction proceeds smoothly when these roles are enacted effectively People also strive to create impressions of themselves in the minds of others in order to gain material and social rewards or avoid material and social punishments \n Cross-cultural communication \n Understanding how one's impression management behavior might be interpreted by others can also serve as the basis for smoother interactions and as a means for solving some of the most insidious communication problems among individuals of different racial/ethnic and gender backgrounds \n \"People are sensitive to how they are seen by others and use many forms of impression management to compel others to react to them in the ways they wish\" Giddens p An example of this concept is easily illustrated through cultural differences Different cultures have diverse thoughts and opinions on what is considered beautiful or attractive For example Americans tend to find tan skin attractive but in Indonesian culture pale skin is more desirable \n Another illustration of how people attempt to control how others perceive them is portrayed through the clothing they wear A person who is in a leadership position strives to be respected and in order to control and maintain the impression This illustration can also be adapted for a cultural scenario The clothing people choose to wear says a great deal about the person and the culture they represent For example most Americans are not overly concerned with conservative clothing Most Americans are content with tee shirts shorts and showing skin The exact opposite is true on the other side of the world \"Indonesians are both modest and conservative in their attire\" Cole p \n Companies use \n cross-cultural training \n CCT to facilitate effective cross-cultural interaction CCT can be defined as any procedure used to increase an individual's ability to cope with and work in a foreign environment Training employees in culturally consistent and specific impression management IM techniques provide the avenue for the employee to consciously switch from an automatic home culture IM mode to an IM mode that is culturally appropriate and acceptable Second training in IM reduces the uncertainty of interaction with FNs and increases employee's ability to cope by reducing unexpected events \n Team-working in hospital wards \n Impression management theory can also be used in health communication It can be used to explore how professionals 'present' themselves when interacting on hospital wards and also how they employ front stage and backstage settings in their collaborative work \n In the hospital wards Goffman's front stage and backstage performances are divided into 'planned' and 'ad hoc' rather than 'official' and 'unofficial' interactions \n Planned front stage is the structured collaborative activities such as ward rounds and care conferences which took place in the presence of patients and/or carers \n Ad hoc front stage is the unstructured or unplanned interprofessional interactions that took place in front of patients/carers or directly involved patients/carers \n Planned backstage is the structured MDT meetings in which professionals gathered in a private area of the ward in the absence of patients to discuss management plans for patients under their care \n Ad hoc backstage is the use of corridors and other ward spaces for quick conversations between professionals in the absence of patients/carers \n Offstage is the social activities between and among professional groups/individuals outside of the hospital context \n Results show that interprofessional interactions in this setting are often based less on planned front stage activities than on ad hoc backstage activities While the former may at times help create and maintain an appearance of collaborative interprofessional 'teamwork' conveying a sense of professional togetherness in front of patients and their families they often serve little functional practice These findings have implications for designing ways to improve interprofessional practice on acute hospital wards where there is no clearly defined interprofessional team but rather a loose configuration of professionals working together in a collaborative manner around a particular patient In such settings interventions that aim to improve both ad hoc as well as planned forms of communication may be more successful than those intended to only improve planned communication \n Computer-mediated communication \n The \n hyperpersonal model \n of \n computer-mediated communication \n CMC posits that users exploit the technological aspects of CMC in order to enhance the messages they construct to manage impressions and facilitate desired relationships The most interesting aspect of the advent of CMC is how it reveals basic elements of interpersonal communication bringing into focus fundamental processes that occur as people meet and develop relationships relying on typed messages as the primary mechanism of expression \"Physical features such as one's appearance and voice provide much of the information on which people base first impressions face-to-face but such features are often unavailable in CMC Various perspectives on CMC have suggested that the lack of nonverbal cues diminishes CMC's ability to foster impression formation and management or argued impressions develop nevertheless relying on language and content cues One approach that describes the way that CMC's technical capacities work in concert with users' impression development intentions is the hyperpersonal model of CMC Walther As receivers CMC users idealize partners based on the circumstances or message elements that suggest minimal similarity or desirability As senders CMC users selectively self-present revealing attitudes and aspects of the self in a controlled and socially desirable fashion The CMC channel facilitates editing discretion and convenience and the ability to tune out environmental distractions and re-allocate cognitive resources in order to further enhance one's message composition Finally CMC may create dynamic feedback loops wherein the exaggerated expectancies are confirmed and reciprocated through mutual interaction via the bias-prone communication processes identified above \" \n According to O'Sullivan's impression management model of communication channels individuals will prefer to use mediated channels rather than face-to-face conversation in face-threatening situations Within his model this trend is due to the channel features that allow for control over exchanged social information The present paper extends O'Sullivan's model by explicating information control as a media affordance arising from channel features and social skills that enables an individual to regulate and restrict the flow of social information in an interaction and present a scale to measure it One dimension of the information control scale expressive information control positively predicted channel preference for recalled face-threatening situations This effect remained after controlling for social anxiousness and power relations in relationships O'Sullivan's model argues that some communication channels may help individuals manage this struggle and therefore be more preferred as those situations arise It was based on an assumption that channels with features that allow fewer social cues such as reduced nonverbal information or slower exchange of messages invariably afford an individual with an ability to better manage the flow of a complex ambiguous or potentially difficult conversations \n Individuals manage what information about them is known or isn't known to control other's impression of them Anyone who has given the bathroom a quick cleaning when they anticipate the arrival of their mother-in-law or date has managed their impression For an example from \n information and communication technology \n use inviting someone to view a person's Webpage before a face-to-face meeting may predispose them to view the person a certain way when they actually meet \n Corporate brand \n The impression management perspective offers potential insight into how corporate stories could build the corporate brand by influencing the impressions that stakeholders form of the organization The link between themes and elements of corporate stories and IM strategies/behaviours indicates that these elements will influence audiences' perceptions of the corporate brand \n Corporate storytelling \n Corporate storytelling is suggested to help demonstrate the importance of the corporate brand to internal and external stakeholders and create a position for the company against competitors as well as help a firm to bond with its employees Roper and Fill The corporate reputation is defined as a stakeholder's perception of the organization Brown et al and Dowling suggests that if the story causes stakeholders to perceive the organization as more authentic distinctive expert sincere powerful and likeable then it is likely that this will enhance the overall corporate reputation \n Impression management theory is a relevant perspective to explore the use of corporate stories in building the corporate brand The corporate branding literature notes that interactions with brand communications enable stakeholders to form an impression of the organization Abratt and Keyn and this indicates that IM theory could also therefore bring insight into the use of corporate stories as a form of communication to build the corporate brand Exploring the IM strategies/behaviors evident in corporate stories can indicate the potential for corporate stories to influence the impressions that audiences form of the corporate brand \n Corporate document \n Firms use more subtle forms of influencing outsiders' impressions of firm performance and prospects namely by manipulating the content and presentation of information in corporate documents with the purpose of \"distort ing readers\" perceptions of corporate achievements\" Godfrey et al p In the accounting literature this is referred to as impression management The opportunity for impression management in corporate reports is increasing Narrative disclosures have become longer and more sophisticated over the last few years This growing importance of descriptive sections in corporate documents provides firms with the opportunity to overcome information asymmetries by presenting more detailed information and explanation thereby increasing their decision-usefulness However they also offer an opportunity for presenting financial performance and prospects in the best possible light thus having the opposite effect In addition to the increased opportunity for opportunistic discretionary disclosure choices impression management is also facilitated in that corporate narratives are largely unregulated \n Media \n The \n medium of communication influences the actions taken in impression management Self-efficacy can differ according to the fact whether the trial to convince somebody is made through face-to-face-interaction or by means of an e-mail \n Communication via devices like telephone e-mail or chat is governed by technical restrictions so that the way people express personal features etc can be changed This often shows how far people will go \n Profiles on social networking sites \n Social networking users will employ protective self-presentations for image management Users will use subtractive and repudiate strategies to maintain a desired image \n Subtractive strategy is used to untag an undesirable photo on Social Networking Sites In addition to un-tagging their name some users will request the photo to be removed entirely Repudiate strategy is used when a friend posts an undesirable comment about the user In response to an undesired post users may add another wall post as an innocence defense Michael Stefanone states that \"self-esteem maintenance is an important motivation for strategic self-presentation online \" \n Outside evaluations of their physical appearance competence and approval from others determines how social media users respond to pictures and wall posts Unsuccessful self-presentation online can lead to rejection and criticism from social groups Social networking sites like MySpace Facebook and StudiVZ are popular means of communicating personality Recent theoretical and empirical considerations of homepages and Web platforms show that impression management is a major motive for actively participating in social networking sites \n According to Marwick social profiles create implications such as \"context collapse\" for presenting oneself to the audience The concept of context collapse suggests that social technologies make it difficult to vary self-presentation based on environment or audience \"Large sites such as Facebook and Twitter group friends family members coworkers and acquaintances together under the umbrella term friends \" \n Not only do users on social networking sites present themselves using photos of themselves but they also use different symbols and \n cultural artifacts \n For example researchers have found that food and situations related to food such as restaurant visits is part of adolescents' self-presentation on online social networks This indicates that messages of food serve a symbolic purpose in these online social networks and it is also argued that this communication influence adolescents in both positive and negative ways with regards to their health \n Political impression management \n One arena where impression management is essential is in politics \"Political impression management\" was coined in by sociologist Peter M Hall who defined the term as the art of making a candidate look electable and capable Hall This is due in part to the importance of \"presidential\" candidatesappearance image and narrative are a key part of a campaign and thus impression management has always been a huge part of winning an election Katz As social media becomes more and more a part of the political process political impression management is becoming more challenging as the online image of the candidate often now lies in the hands of the voters themselves \n Implications \n Impression management can distort the results of empirical research that relies on interviews and surveys a phenomenon commonly referred to as \"social desirability bias\" Impression management theory nevertheless constitutes a field of research on its own \n When it comes to practical questions concerning public relations and the way organizations should handle their public image the assumptions provided by impression management theory can also provide a framework \n An examination of different impression management strategies acted out by individuals who were facing criminal trials where the trial outcomes could range from a death sentence life in prison or acquittal has been reported in the forensic literature \n The Perri and Lichtenwald article examined female \n psychopathic \n killers whom as a group were highly motivated to manage the impression that attorneys judges mental health professions and ultimately a jury had of the murderers and the murder they committed It provides legal case illustrations of the murderers combining and/or switching from one impression management strategy such as ingratiation or supplication to another as they worked towards their goal of diminishing or eliminating any accountability for the murders they committed \n Since the 1990s researchers in the area of sport and exercise psychology have studied self-presentation Concern about how one is perceived has been found to be relevant to the study of athletic performance For example anxiety may be produced when an athlete is in the presence of spectators Self-presentational concerns have also been found to be relevant to exercise For example the concerns may elicit motivation to exercise \n More recent research investigating the effects of impression management on social behaviour showed that social behaviours e g eating can serve to convey a desired impression to others and enhance one's self-image Research on eating has shown that people tend to eat less when they believe that they are being observed by others \n Calculating Visions Kennedy Johnson and

only agreement and compliance \" \n In his later research McClelland refined his theory to include two distinct types of power motivation the need for \n socialized power \n expressed on the TAT by descriptions of plans self-doubts mixed outcomes and concern for others and the need for \n personal power \n expressed by stories in which one individual seeks power and must oppose another to get it \n Compared to people who value affiliation or achievement individuals with high nPow scores tend to be more argumentative more assertive in group discussions and more likely to experience frustration when they feel powerless or not in control of a situation \n They are more likely to seek or hold a position in which they have control over others and to engage in \n conspicuous consumption \n Pros and cons \n For individuals \n A high nPow score predicts greater career success for men and for women who report high satisfaction with the power-related aspects of their workplace \n McClelland's own research included case studies illustrating the advantage of high nPow in the workplace especially for more experienced workers competing for management positions In one characteristic example a successful salesman with a high need for affiliation and a low need for power began to perform poorly after being promoted to management He experienced difficulty giving direct orders leading his subordinates to complain that he failed to set clear goals and reward individuals who performed well \n Outside of work a high nPow score is associated with both positive and negative outcomes with the result often depending on whether an individual also reports a strong sense of responsibility When combined with a low score on a measure of responsibility a high nPow score predicts higher rates of \n externalizing \n self-destructive \n behavior such as binge-drinking and physical aggression Men with this combination of personality traits are more likely to divorce separate or physically abuse their spouses However this association disappears for individuals with average or high responsibility scores who are disproportionately likely to report positive outcomes like taking on social leadership roles \n For society \n As with individual outcomes whether a high need for power results in positive or negative outcomes is influenced by the individual's other traits particularly responsibility and empathy An argumentative group member may prevent \n groupthink \n or they may intimidate other group members and refuse to make reasonable compromises a hard-charging manager may motivate and focus their team or they may bully and manipulate their subordinates Even dangerous behaviors like impulsive risk-taking can be beneficial in moderation successful stock traders \n and entrepreneurs \n often have a high propensity for risk \n Gender \n On average men report a higher need for power than women which may be due to biological factors social factors or an interaction between them Gender also influences how the need for power is outwardly expressed men are more likely to express anger directly use physical violence to establish control or engage in risky or impulsive behavior while women are more likely to employ \n relational aggression \n or suppress their hostility \n When the needs for socialized and personal power are measured separately women managers express a greater desire for socialized power than their male counterparts but an equal desire for personal power Interestingly men but not women reported greater job satisfaction if they had a high need for socialized power \n Other parts of the theory \n Need for achievement \n Need for achievement \n Murray defined \n need for achievement \n as the attempt to overcome obstacles Need for achievement nAch was defined by McClelland as the motive to strive for success in particular situations in which his/her performance would be looked at against some type of standard McClelland used the thematic apperception test in order to test this part of his theory He would show people four pictures and ask people to write a story regarding these pictures Based on his/her story McClelland would be able to determine what type of achievement a person strived \n Need for affiliation \n Need for affiliation \n Murray believed \n need for affiliation \n was a trait that was very strong in most people especially in stressful situations Murray believed that when people were put into a stressful situation people were more likely to feel less stress if another person was present In McClelland's research he found that people who had need for affiliation were often unpopular tried to avoid interpersonal conflicts because they have levels of anxiety about if others will accept them \n Will to power"},
{"theme": "achievement", "theme.id": 2, "document.id": 10, "title": "Social proof", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof", "depth": 1, "text": "Social proof \n This article is about behavior imitation to reflect correct social behavior For imitation to gain approval see \n normative social influence \n Social proof \n also known as \n informational social influence \n is a \n psychological \n and \n social \n phenomenon where people assume the actions of others in an attempt to reflect correct behavior in a given situation \n Social proof is considered prominent in ambiguous social situations where people are unable to determine the appropriate \n mode of behavior \n and is driven by the assumption that the surrounding people possess more knowledge about the current situation \n The effects of \n social influence \n can be seen in the tendency of large groups to conform to choices which are either correct or mistaken This is referred to in some publications as the \n herd behavior \n Although social proof reflects a rational motive to take into account the information possessed by others and formal analysis that shows it can cause people to converge too quickly upon a single distinct choice so that decisions of even larger groups of individuals may be grounded in very little information see \n information cascades \n Social proof is one type of \n conformity \n When a person is in a situation where they are unsure of the correct way to behave they will often look to others for clues concerning the correct behavior When \"we conform because we believe that others' interpretation of an ambiguous situation is more accurate than ours and will help us choose an appropriate course of action\" \n it is informational social influence This is contrasted with \n normative social influence \n wherein a person conforms to be liked or accepted by others \n Social proof often leads not only to public \n compliance \n conforming to the behavior of others publicly without necessarily believing it is correct but also private acceptance conforming out of a genuine belief that others are correct \n Social proof is more powerful when being accurate is more important and when others are perceived as especially knowledgeable \n Mechanisms \n Multiple source effect \n Uncertainty about the correct conclusion \n Similarity to the surrounding group \n Research \n Early research \n Cultural effects on social proof \n Copycat suicides \n Examples \n In employment \n In entertainment \n In social media \n The environment \n Modifiers \n Possession of special knowledge \n Identification with authority \n \"Smart money\" \n Mechanisms \n Multiple source effect \n The multiple source effect occurs when people give more credence to ideas that are stated by multiple sources This effect can be clearly seen when social proof occurs For instance one study observed that people who hear five positive reviews on a book as read by five different synthesized voices perceive that book more favourably than if they hear the same five reviews as read by one synthesized voice \n Uncertainty about the correct conclusion \n Uncertainty is a major factor that encourages the use of social proof One study found that when evaluating a product consumers were more likely to incorporate the opinions of others through the use of social proof when their own experiences with the product were ambiguous leaving uncertainty as to the correct conclusion that they should make \n Similarity to the surrounding group \n Similarity also motivates the use of social proof when a person perceives themselves as similar to the people around them they are more likely to adopt and perceive as correct the observed behavior of these people This has been noted in areas such as the use of \n laugh tracks \n where participants will laugh longer and harder when they perceive the people laughing to be similar to themselves \n Social proof is also one of \n Robert Cialdini's \n six principles of persuasion along with reciprocity commitment/consistency authority liking and scarcity which maintains that people are especially likely to perform certain actions if they can relate to the people who performed the same actions before them \n One experiment which exemplifies this claim was conducted by researchers who joined a door-to-door charity campaign who found that if a list of prior donators was longer the next person solicited was more likely to donate as well This trend was even more pronounced when the names on the donor list were people that the prospective donor knew such as friends and neighbors \n Cialdini's principle also asserts that peer power is effective because people are more likely respond to influence tactics applied horizontally rather than vertically so people are more likely to be persuaded by a colleague than a superior \n Research \n Early research \n The most famous study of social proof is \n Muzafer Sherif's \n experiment \n In this experiment subjects were placed in a dark room and asked to look at a dot of light about feet away They were then asked how much in inches the dot of light was moving In reality it was not moving at all but due to the \n autokinetic effect \n it appeared to move How much the light appears to move varies from person to person but is generally consistent over time for each individual A few days later a second part of the experiment was conducted Each subject was paired with two other subjects and asked to give their estimate of how much the light was moving out loud Even though the subjects had previously given different estimates the groups would come to a common estimate To rule out the possibility that the subjects were simply giving the group answer to avoid looking foolish while still believing their original estimate was correct Sherif had the subjects judge the lights again by themselves after doing so in the group They maintained the group's judgment Because the movement of the light is ambiguous the participants were relying on each other to define reality \n Another study looked at informational social influence in \n eyewitness identification \n Subjects were shown a slide of the \"perpetrator\" They were then shown a slide of a line-up of four men one of whom was the perpetrator they had seen and were asked to pick him out The task was made difficult to the point of ambiguity by presenting the slides very quickly The task was done in a group that consisted of one actual subject and three confederates a person acting as a subject but actually working for the experimenter The confederates answered first and all three gave the same wrong answer In a high-importance condition of the experiment subjects were told that they were participating in a real test of eyewitness identification ability that would be used by police departments and courts and their scores would establish the norm for performance In a low-importance condition subjects were told that the slide task was still being developed and that the experimenters had no idea what the norm for performance wasthey were just looking for useful hints to improve the task It was found that when subjects thought the task was of high importance they were more likely to conform giving the confederate's wrong answer 51% of the time as opposed to 35% of the time in the low-importance condition \n Cultural effects on social proof \n The strength of social proof also varies across different cultures For instance studies have shown that subjects in collectivist cultures conform to others' social proof more often than those in individualist cultures \n Although this trend seems reoccurring there is evidence which suggests that these results are a simplification and that an independent subject's personal individualistic-collectivist tendency also makes an impact upon their decisions \n Additional variables such as the subject's sense of social responsibility need to be taken into account to better understand the mechanisms of social proof across cultures for example more collectivist individuals will often have an increased compulsion to help others because of their prominent awareness of social responsibility and this in turn will increase the likelihood they will comply to requests regardless of their peers' previous decisions \n Copycat suicides \n Further information \n Copycat suicide Social proof model \n Social proof has been proposed as an explanation for \n copycat suicide \n where suicide rates increase following media publication about suicides \n One study using \n agent-based modeling \n showed that copycat suicides are more likely when there are similarities between the person involved in the publicized suicide and the potential copycats \n In addition research performed by David Phillips between and further supports the existence of copycat suicides \n Examples \n In employment \n A person who has been \n unemployed \n for a long time may have a hard time finding a new jobeven if they are highly skilled and qualified Potential employers attribute wrongly the person's lack of employment to the person rather than the situation This causes the potential employers to search more intensively for flaws or other negative characteristics that are \"congruent\" with or explain the person's failure and to discount the applicant's virtues \n Similarly a person who is in high demandfor example a \n CEO \n may continue to get many attractive job offers and can as a result extract a considerable wage premiumeven if his/her objective performance has been poor When people appear successful potential employers and others who evaluate them tend to search more intensively for virtues or positive characteristics that are \"congruent\" with or explain the person's success and to ignore or underestimate the person's faults People who experience positive social proof may also benefit from a \n halo effect \n Other attributes are deemed to be more positive than they actually are Additionally the person's attributes may be viewed with a positive \n framing \n bias For example a person might be viewed as arrogant if they have negative social proof and bold if they have positive social proof For these reasons social proof is important in determining a potential employer's \n consideration set \n Social proof naturally also applies to products and is used extensively in marketing and sales \n Situations that violate social proof can cause \n cognitive dissonance \n and can cause people to have a sense of loss of control or failure of the \" \n just world hypothesis \n \" \n In entertainment \n Theaters sometimes use \n specially planted audience members \n who are instructed to give ovations at pre-arranged times Usually these people are the ones who clap initially and the rest of the audience follows Such ovations may be perceived by non-expert audience members as signals of the performance's quality \n Contrary to common annoyance of \n canned laughter \n in television shows television studios have discovered that they can increase the perceived \"funniness\" of a show by merely playing canned laughter at key \"funny\" moments They have found that even though viewers find canned laughter highly annoying they perceive shows that happen to use canned laughter more funny than the shows that do not use canned laughter \n In social media \n Social proof is also prominent on social networks such as Twitter Facebook Instagram and YouTube The number of followers fans views likes favorites and even comments that a user has made positively affects how other users perceive them A user on Twitter with a million followers is perceived as more trustworthy and reputable than a similar user with a thousand followers resulting in faster growth of followers and higher engagement and click-through-rates \n Although these fake followers will never help meet business objectives or generate sales directly \n An entire multimillion-dollar industry known as \n ghost followers \n exist for the sole purpose of increasing social proof on social media \n The environment \n Social norms are often not clearly articulated for sustainable or pro-environmental conduct \n A good example is the consumption of bottled water Many people are generally unaware of the negative environmental consequences associated with the production and consumption of bottled water A recent study by van der Linden \n uses the 'informational social influence' hypothesis to illustrate that people are more likely to reduce their consumption of bottled water when simple information on negative impacts is preceded by 'social proof' that referent others have already started to behave pro-environmentally as well i e illustrating the appropriate social norm \n Modifiers \n This section \n does not \n cite \n any \n sources \n Please help \n improve this

one perceives themselves as a relevant authority figure in the situation they are less likely to follow the surrounding group's behavior This is a combination of \"Identification of the surrounding group with self\" and \"Possession of special knowledge\" People in authority positions tend to place themselves in different categories than other people and usually they have special training or knowledge that allows them to conclude that they are better informed than the surrounding group \n \"Smart money\" \n One might perceive particular groups of others identified by their behavior or other characteristics to be more reliable guides to the situation than the average person One might think truck drivers to be more frequent and therefore more experienced drivers than others and therefore weigh more heavily the number of trucks than the number of cars parked when judging the quality of a restaurant One might identify the movement of betting odds or securities prices at

Cognition is associated with deep thought \n The \n need for cognition \n NFC \n in \n psychology \n is a \n personality variable \n reflecting the extent to which individuals are inclined towards \n

\n Dual-system theory \n Biases and decision making \n False memories \n Halo effects \n Relationship with personality traits \n Related constructs \n Other personality characteristics \n Consumers \n Footnotes \n Cohen Stotland and Wolfe \n in their work on individual differences in cognitive motivation identified a \" \n need for cognition \n \" which they defined as \"the individual's need to organize his experience meaningfully\" the \"need to structure relevant situations in meaningful integrated ways\" and \"need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world\" p They argued that if this \"need\" were frustrated it would generate \"feelings of tension and deprivation\" that would instigate \"active efforts to structure the situation and increase understanding\" p though the particular situations arousing and satisfying the need may vary p Cohen argued that even in structured situations people high in NFC see ambiguity and strive for higher standards of cognitive clarity \n Cohen and colleagues \n themselves identified multiple prior identifications of need for cognition citing works by \n Murphy \n Maslow \n Katz \n Harlow \n and \n Asch \n They \n distinguished their concept from the apparently similar \"intolerance of ambiguity\" proposed by \n Frenkel-Brunswik \n arguing that NFC does not reflect the need to experience an integrated and meaningful world Contemporary research suggests that Cohen's conception of need is however closer to tolerance of ambiguity need for structure or need for cognitive closure than to current ideas of need for cognition For instance studies using Cohen's measures indicated avoidance of ambiguity and a need to get \"meaning\" even if this meant relying on heuristics or expert advice rather than careful scrutiny of incoming information \n Building on this work \n Cacioppo \n therefore moved away from drive-reduction toward measuring \n individual differences \n in the self-reward potential of cognitive activity \n stressing p that they were using the word need in the statistical sense of a \"likelihood or tendency\" rather than in the rudimentary biological sense of \"tissue deprivation\" they defined the need for cognition as an individual's tendency to \"engage in and enjoy thinking\" p and the tendency to \"organize abstract and evaluate information\" p or variously as a stable but individually different \"tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive endeavors\" or an \"intrinsic motivation to engage in effortful cognitive endeavors and exercise their mental faculties\" \n or an \"intrinsic motivation for effortful thought\" \n Cacioppo and Petty created their own scale to measure the need for cognition This was subsequently slightly amended \n and in most of the cases reported in the subsequent literature it is this amended scale that is administered \n Features \n People high in the need for cognition are more likely to form their attitudes by paying close attention to relevant arguments i e via the \n central route to persuasion \n whereas people low in the need for cognition are more likely to rely on \n peripheral cues \n such as how attractive or credible a speaker is People low in need for cognition are also more likely to rely on stereotypes alone in judging other people than those high in need for cognition \n Psychological research on the need for cognition has been conducted using self-report tests where research participants answered a series of statements such as \"I prefer my life to be filled with puzzles that I must solve\" and were scored on how much they felt the statements represented them The results have suggested that people who are high in the need for cognition scale score slightly higher in verbal intelligence tests but no higher in abstract reasoning tests \n Research has concluded that individuals high in NFC are less likely to attribute higher social desirability to more attractive individuals or to mates \n College students high in NFC report higher \n life satisfaction \n A study on \n lucid dreaming \n found that frequent and occasional lucid dreamers scored higher on NFC than non-lucid dreamers \n This suggests there is continuity between waking and dreaming cognitive styles Researchers have argued that this is because self-reflectiveness or self-focused attention is heightened in lucid dreams and also is associated with greater need for cognition \n Relationship to intelligence \n A number of studies have found moderate correlations between NFC and measures of verbal intelligence One study found that need for cognition had a moderate positive correlation with \n fluid intelligence \n reasoning ability particularly verbal and to a lesser extent numeric and figural reasoning and a weaker correlation with \n crystallised intelligence \n knowledge which had much smaller positive correlations \n Dual-system theory \n NFC has been incorporated into Epstein's dual-system theory of personality called \n cognitive-experiential self-theory \n The theory proposes that people have two information processing systems a rational system and an experiential system The rational system is thought to be logical verbal and relatively unemotional The experiential system is thought to be intuitive based on images and highly reliant on emotion A modified version of the Need for Cognition scale has been used to assess individual differences in the rational system whereas the experiential system has been assessed using a scale called Faith in Intuition \n Research shows that the two system are uncorrelated and hence independent of each other That is individuals either high or low in need for cognition may also make use of their intuitions in forming judgments In fact individuals high and low in need for cognition respectively may make use of their intuitions in differing ways When individuals give little thought to their judgments these judgments may be influenced directly by emotions intuitions and images in an automatic way On the other hand those who are high in need for cognition tend to give more thought to their judgments and the thoughts generated may be indirectly biased by their emotions intuitions and images Hence individuals high in need for cognition are not necessarily more \"rational\" than those low in this trait if their faith in intuition is also high Rather their \"irrational\" intuitions tend to be given more thoughtful elaboration than those who are low in need for cognition and yet also high in faith in intuition \n Biases and decision making \n NFC is associated with the amount of thought that goes into making a decision Both high and low levels of the trait may be associated with particular biases in judgment People low in need for cognition tend to show more bias when this bias is due to relying on mental shortcuts that is heuristic biases People high in this trait tend to be more affected by biases that are generated by effortful thought \n False memories \n High need for cognition is associated with a greater susceptibility to the creation of false memories associated with certain learning tasks In a commonly used research paradigm participants are asked to memorise a list of related words Recognition is tested by having them pick out learned words from a set of studied and non-studied items Certain non-studied items are conceptually related to studied items e g \n chair \n if the original list contained \n table \n and \n legs \n People high in NFC are more likely to show \n false memory \n for these lures due to their greater elaboration of learned items in memory as they are more likely to think of semantically related but non-studied items \n Halo effects \n A bias associated with low need for cognition is the \n halo effect \n a phenomenon in which attractive or likeable people tend to be rated as superior on a variety of other characteristics e g intelligence People low on NFC are more likely to rely on stereotypes rather than individual features of a person when rating a novel target People high in NFC still show a halo effect however albeit a smaller one perhaps because their thoughts about the target are still biased by the target's attractiveness \n Relationship with personality traits \n Related constructs \n NFC has been found to be strongly associated with a number of independently developed constructs specifically epistemic curiosity \n typical intellectual engagement \n and \n openness to ideas \n Epistemic \n curiosity \n can be defined as desire for knowledge that motivates individuals to learn new ideas eliminate information-gaps and solve intellectual problems \n Typical intellectual engagement was proposed by Goff and Ackerman and was defined as a \"personality construct that represents an individuals aversion or attraction to tasks that are intellectually taxing\" \n Openness to ideas is a facet of \n openness to experience \n associated with \"aspects of being open minded engaging in unconventional thoughts and solving problems and thinking as an end in itself\" \n Based on the very large positive correlation between NFC and typical intellectual engagement \n r \n = it has been argued that they may be essentially the same construct \n Further studies have found that NFC typical intellectual engagement epistemic curiosity and openness to ideas were all strongly intercorrelated \n Factor analysis \n showed that measures of all four constructs loaded strongly onto a single factor suggesting they all share a common conceptual basis \n The author of this study argued that although the four constructs lack \n discriminant validity \n they are not necessarily all conceptually equivalent as each one may emphasise particular aspects of functioning more than others \n A study comparing need for cognition and openness to ideas using confirmatory factor analysis found that although the two constructs were very strongly related they were not redundant NFC and openness to ideas had somewhat contrasting correlation patterns with other personality traits \n For example NFC was more strongly correlated with emotional stability and activity than openness to ideas whereas openness to ideas was more strongly correlated with \n novelty \n and \n experience seeking \n than NFC \n Other personality characteristics \n Within the \n Big Five \n model of personality NFC has been found to relate positively to \n openness to experience \n most strongly and to a more moderate extent to \n conscientiousness \n particularly the competence and achievement striving facets and to relate inversely to an extent to \n neuroticism \n Regarding \n Cloninger \n 's temperament traits NFC has been related negatively to \n harm avoidance \n and positively to \n persistence \n and was unrelated to \n reward dependence \n or \n novelty seeking \n NFC has only a weak positive relationship with \n sensation seeking \n specifically a weak correlation with the boredom susceptibility subscale but no relationship to the other subscales \n NFC has a modest inverse correlation with \n negative affect \n NFC had no significant correlation with a broad measure of overall positive affect although it was positively correlated with feelings of activity interest and alertness \n NFC has been positively related to other theoretically unrelated personality characteristics such as \n self-esteem \n masculine sex-role attitudes and \n absorption \n NFC is negatively related to \n social anxiety \n more strongly in females than males \n It has been speculated that people who more carefully analyse their world feel a greater sense of mastery and hence greater self-esteem although it is also possible that higher self-esteem may lead to greater motivation to engage in thinking \n NFC may be related to masculine sex-role due to the stereotype associating masculinity with rationality \n Regarding absorption people high in NFC may find it easier to devote their attentional processes exclusively to intellectual tasks \n Regarding social anxiety it is possible that greater attention to cognitive activity may be associated with reduced attention to social cues associated with negative evaluation \n Consumers \n Research has shown that high-need for cognition consumers prefer advertising that features open-ended comparative advertising which allows consumers to decide which brand is best \n NFC has also offered insights into how people respond to alternative web site designs Martin Sherrard and Wentzel demonstrate that high-need for cognition people prefer web sites with high verbal complexity more in-depth information and low visual complexity static images rather than animations \n

The \n need for affiliation \n N-Affil \n is a term that was popularized by \n David McClelland \n and describes a person's \n need \n to feel a sense of involvement and \"belonging\" within a \n social group \n McClellend's thinking was strongly influenced by the pioneering work of \n Henry Murray \n who first identified underlying psychological human needs and \n motivational \n processes It was Murray who set out a taxonomy of needs including achievement \n power \n and affiliationand placed these in the context of an integrated motivational model People with a high need for affiliation require warm \n interpersonal relationships \n and approval from those with whom they have regular contact Having a strong bond with others make a person feel as if they are a part of something important that creates a powerful impact People who place high emphasis on affiliation tend to be supportive team members but may be less effective in \n leadership positions \n A person who takes part in a group whether it be a movement or project create a push towards a sense of achievement and satisfaction for the individual and the whole \n Definition \n Situations \n Definition \n Affiliation is a positive sometimes intimate personal relationship \n Affiliation can include \"concern over establishing maintaining or restoring a positive affective relationship with another person or persons\" \n Situations \n There are many situations in which people feel a need for affiliation For example in a business setting when creating a new product there can be many different ideas on how to market the product A recently hired employee might feel a need for affiliation to have their idea heard because they feel this is the best course of action If that person's idea is a success then that individual will feel a sense of achievement Thus being new the employee he decides to involve himself so he feels a sense of belonging to the rest of the employees One situation that causes a greater need for affiliation is during a stressful situation An example where there was an increase in the need for affiliation among individuals was right after the \n September terrorist attack \n on the \n World Trade Center \n This event led to Americans' putting their differences aside and coming together The increase in an individual's need for affiliation allowed individuals responding to the same \n stressor \n to come together and find security in one another Situations that include \n fear \n often lead people to want to be together and trigger a need for affiliation \n Research done by Schachter shows that fear that comes from anxiety increases the need for the person to affiliate with others who are going through the same situation or that could help them through the stressful event \n The strength of this need changes from one person to the next there are moments that people just want to be together \n The need for affiliation for an individual can vary over short amounts of time there are times when individuals wish to be with others and other times to be alone In one study completed by Shawn O'Connor and Lorne Rosenblood \n beepers \n were distributed to the students The students were then asked to record when their beepers went off whether or not they wanted to be alone or if they wanted to be with others at that particular moment This study was done to observe how frequently college students were in the presence of others and how frequently they were alone The next step in this study asked for the students to record whether at the time their beeper went off they wanted to be alone or in the company of others This response that they gave usually reflected which of the two situations they were experiencing the next time their beepers went off The information retained from this study helped to show the strength of an individual's need for affiliation \n By showing how frequently they obtained the presence of others when they felt that it was what they wanted at that moment it showed how strong their need for affiliation was at that particular moment \n Depending on the specific circumstances an individual's level of need for affiliation can become increased or decreased Yacov Rofe suggested that the need for affiliation depended on whether being with others would be useful for the situation or not When the presence of other people was seen as being helpful in relieving an individual from some of the negative aspects of the stressor an individual's desire to affiliate increases However if being with others may increase the negative aspects such as adding the possibility of embarrassment to the already present stressor the individual's desire to affiliate with others decreases \n Individuals are motivated to find and create a specific amount of social interactions Each individual desires a different amount of a need for affiliation and they desire an optimal balance of time to their self and time spent with others \n Affection \n Need theory \n Need for achievement \n Maslow's hierarchy of needs \n Cultural identity"},

is about the psychological phenomenon For the bystander effect in radiobiology see \n Bystander effect radiobiology \n The \n bystander effect \n or \n bystander apathy \n is a \n social psychological \n phenomenon in which individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim when other people are present The greater the number of bystanders the less likely it is that any one of them will help Several factors contribute to the bystander effect including \n ambiguity \n cohesiveness \n and \n diffusion of responsibility \n Social psychology research \n Variables affecting bystanders \n

Implications of research \n South African murder trials \n Laws \n Notable examples \n Kitty Genovese \n Raymond Zack \n Wang Yue \n Reversal of bystander effect \n Role of public self-awareness \n Experiments \n Social psychology research \n The bystander effect was first demonstrated in the laboratory by \n John M Darley \n and \n Bibb Latan \n in after they became interested in the topic following the \n murder of Kitty Genovese \n in \n These researchers launched a series of experiments that resulted in one of the strongest and most \n replicable \n effects in \n social psychology \n In a typical experiment the participant is either alone or among a group of other participants or confederates An emergency situation is \n staged \n and researchers \n measure \n how long it takes the participants to intervene if they intervene These experiments have found that the presence of others inhibits helping often by a large margin \n For example Bibb Latan and Judith Rodin staged an experiment around a woman in distress percent of the people alone called out or went to help the woman after they believed she had fallen and was hurt but when there were other people in the room only percent offered help \n Variables affecting bystanders \n Emergency versus non-emergency situations \n Latan and Darley performed three experiments to test bystander behavior in non- \n emergency \n situations \n Their results indicated that the way in which the subjects were asked for help mattered In one condition subjects asked a bystander for his or her name More people provided an answer when the students gave their name first In another condition the students asked bystanders for a dime When the student gave an explanation such as saying that their wallet had been stolen the percentage of people giving assistance was higher 72% than when the student just asked for a dime 34% Additional research by Faul Mark et al using data collected by EMS officials when responding to an emergency indicated that the response of bystanders was correlated with the health severity of the situation \n According to Latan and Darley there are five characteristics of emergencies that affect bystanders \n Emergencies involve threat of harm or actual harm \n Emergencies are unusual and rare \n The type of action required in an emergency differs from situation to situation \n Emergencies cannot be predicted or expected \n Emergencies require immediate action \n Due to these five characteristics bystanders go through cognitive and behavioural processes \n Notice \n that something is going on \n Interpret \n the situation as being an emergency \n Degree of responsibility \n felt \n Form of assistance \n Implement the action choice \n Notice \n To test the concept of \"noticing \" Latane and Darley staged an emergency using Columbia University students The students were placed in a roomeither alone with two strangers or with three strangers to complete a questionnaire while they waited for the experimenter to return While they were completing the questionnaire smoke was pumped into the room through a wall vent to simulate an emergency When students were working alone they noticed the smoke almost immediately within seconds However students that were working in groups took longer up to seconds to notice the smoke Latan and Darley claimed this phenomenon could be explained by the social norm of what is considered polite etiquette in public In most western cultures politeness dictates that it is inappropriate to idly look around This may indicate that a person is nosy or rude As a result passers-by are more likely to be keeping their attention to themselves when around large groups than when alone People who are alone are more likely to be conscious of their surroundings and therefore more likely to notice a person in need of assistance \n Interpret \n Once a situation has been noticed a bystander may be encouraged to intervene if they interpret the incident as an emergency According to the principle of \n social influence \n bystanders monitor the reactions of other people in an emergency situation to see if others think that it is necessary to intervene If it is determined that others are not reacting to the situation bystanders will interpret the situation as not an emergency and will not intervene This is an example of \n pluralistic ignorance \n or \n social proof \n Referring to the smoke experiment even though students in the groups had clearly noticed the smoke which had become so thick that it was obscuring their vision irritating their eyes or causing them to cough they were still unlikely to report it Only one participant in the group condition reported the smoke within the first four minutes and by the end of the experiment no-one from five of eight groups had reported the smoke at all In the groups that did not report the smoke the interpretations of its cause and the likelihood that it was genuinely threatening was also less serious with no-one suggesting fire as a possible cause but some preferring less serious explanations such as the air-conditioner was leaking \n Similarly interpretations of the context played an important role in people's reactions to a man and woman fighting in the street When the woman yelled \"Get away from me I don't know you \" bystanders intervened percent of the time but only percent of the time when the woman yelled \"Get away from me I don't know why I ever married you \" \n General bystander effect research was mainly conducted in the context of non-dangerous non-violent emergencies A study tested bystander effect in emergency situations to see if they would get the same results from other studies testing non-emergencies In situations with low potential danger significantly more help was given when the person was alone than when they were around another person However in situations with high potential danger participants confronted with an emergency alone or in the presence of another person were similarly likely to help the victim \n This suggests that in situations of greater seriousness it is more likely that people will interpret the situation as one in which help is needed and will be more likely to intervene \n Degree of Responsibility \n Darley and Latan determined that the degree of responsibility a bystander feels is dependent on three things \n Whether or not they feel the person is deserving of help \n The competence of the bystander \n The relationship between the bystander and the victim \n Forms of Assistance \n There are two categories of assistance as defined by Latan and Darley \n Direct intervention directly assisting the victim \n Detour \n intervention Detour intervention refers to reporting an emergency to the authorities i e the police fire department \n Implementation \n After going through steps 1-4 the bystander must implement the action of choice \n In one study done by Abraham S Ross the effects of increased responsibility on bystander intervention were studied by increasing the presence of children This study was based on the reaction of male undergraduates presented with emergency situations The prediction was that the intervention would be at its peak due to presence of children around those male undergraduate participants This was experimented and showed that the prediction was not supported and was concluded as \"the type of study did not result in significant differences in intervention \" \n A meta-analysis of the bystander effect \n reported that \"The bystander effect was attenuated when situations were perceived as dangerous compared with non-dangerous perpetrators were present compared with non-present and the costs of intervention were physical compared with non-physical This pattern of findings is consistent with the arousal-cost-reward model which proposes that dangerous emergencies are recognized faster and more clearly as real emergencies thereby inducing higher levels of arousal and hence more helping \" They also \"identified situations where bystanders provide welcome physical support for the potentially intervening individual and thus reduce the bystander effect such as when the bystanders were exclusively male when they were naive rather than passive confederates or only virtually present persons and when the bystanders were not strangers \" \n An alternative explanation has been proposed by \n Stanley Milgram \n who hypothesized that the bystanders callous behavior was caused by the strategies they had adopted in daily life to cope with \n information overload \n This idea has been supported to varying degrees by empirical research \n Timothy Hart and Ternace Miethe used data from the National Crime Victimization Survey NCVS and found that a bystander was present in percent of the violent \n victimizations \n in the data Their presence was most common in cases of physical assaults 68% which accounted for the majority of these violent victimizations and less likely in \n robberies \n 49% and \n sexual assaults \n 28% The actions of bystanders were most frequently judged by victims as \"neither helping nor hurting\" 48% followed by \"helping\" 37% \"hurting\" 10% and \"both helping and hurting\" 3% Half of the attacks in which a bystander was present occurred in the evening where the victim and bystander were strangers \n Ambiguity and consequences \n Ambiguity is one factor that affects whether or not a person assists another in need In some cases of high ambiguity it can take a person or group up to times as long before taking action than in cases of low ambiguity In these cases bystanders determine their own safety before proceeding Bystanders are more likely to intervene in low ambiguity insignificant consequence situations than in high ambiguity significant consequence situations \n Understanding of environment \n Whether or not a bystander intervenes may have to do with their familiarity of the environment where the emergency occurs If the bystander is familiar with the environment they are more likely to know where to get help where the exits are etc \n Bystanders who are in an environment in which they are not familiar with the surroundings are less likely to give help in an emergency situation \n Priming the bystander effect \n Research done by Garcia et al indicate that priming a social context may inhibit helping behavior \n Imagining being around one other person or being around a group of people can affect a person's willingness to help \n Cohesiveness and group membership \n Group cohesiveness \n Group cohesiveness is another variable that can affect the helping behaviour of a bystander As defined by Rutkowski et al cohesiveness refers to an established relationship friends acquaintances between two or more people \n Experiments have been done to test the performance of bystanders when they are in groups with people they have been acquainted with According to Rutkowski et al the social responsibility norm affects helping behavior The norm of social responsibility states that \"people should help others who are in need of help and who are dependent on them for it \" As suggested by the research the more cohesive a group the more likely the group will act in accordance to the social responsibility norm To test this hypothesis researchers used undergraduate students and divided them into four groups a low cohesive group with two people a low cohesive group with four people a high cohesive group with two people and a high cohesive group with four people Students in the high cohesive group were then acquainted with each other by introducing themselves and discussing what they liked/disliked about school and other similar topics The point of the experiment was to determine whether or not high cohesive groups were more willing to help a hurt \"victim\" than the low cohesive groups The four member high cohesive groups were the quickest and most likely groups to respond to the victim who they believed to be hurt The four member low cohesive groups were the slowest and least likely to respond to the victim \n Altruism \n research suggests that helping behaviour is more likely when there are similarities between the helper and the person being helped Recent research has considered the role of similarity and more specifically shared group membership in encouraging bystander intervention In one experiment researchers found that bystanders were more likely to help an injured person if that person was wearing a football jersey of a team the bystander liked as opposed to a team the bystander did not like However when their shared identity as football fans was made salient supporters of both teams were likely to be helped significantly more so than a person wearing a plain shirt \n The findings of Mark Levine and Simon Crowther illustrated that increasing group size inhibited intervention in a street violence scenario when bystanders were strangers but encouraged intervention when bystanders were friends They also found that when gender identity is salient group size encouraged intervention when bystanders and victims shared social category membership In addition group size interacted with context-specific norms that both inhibit and encourage helping The bystander effect is not a generic consequence of increasing group size When bystanders share group-level psychological relationships group size can encourage as well as inhibit helping \n These findings can be explained in terms of self-categorization and \n empathy \n From the perspective of \n self-categorization theory \n a persons own social identity well-being is tied to their group membership so that when a group based identity is salient the suffering of one group member can be considered to directly affect the group Because of this shared identity referred to as \n self-other merging \n bystanders are able to empathize which has been found to predict helping behaviour For example in a study relating to helping after eviction both social identification and empathy were found to predict helping However when social identification was controlled for empathy no longer predicted helping behaviour \n Cultural differences \n In discussing the \n case of Wang Yue \n and a later incident in \n China \n in which \n CCTV footage \n from a \n Shanghai \n subway \n showed passengers fleeing from a foreigner who fainted \n UCLA \n anthropologist Yunxiang Yan asserted that the reactions can be explained by deeply seated historical cultural differences in Chinese \n agrarian society \n in which there was a stark contrast between how individuals associated with \n ingroup and outgroup \n members saying \"How to treat strangers nicely is one of the biggest challenges in contemporary Chinese society The prevailing ethical system in traditional China is based on close-knit community ties kinship ties \" He continued \"A person might treat other people in the person's social group very very nicely But turn around when facing to a stranger and a person might tend to be very suspicious And whenever possible might take advantage of that stranger \" \n Diffusion of responsibility \n Diffusion of responsibility \n Darley and Latan conducted research on diffusion of responsibility \n The findings suggest that in the case of an emergency when people believe that there are other people around they are less likely or slower to help a victim because they believe someone else will take responsibility People may also fail to take responsibility for a situation depending on the context They may assume that other bystanders are more qualified to help such as \n doctors \n or \n police officers \n and that their intervention would be unneeded They may also be afraid of being superseded by a superior helper offering unwanted assistance or facing the legal consequences of offering inferior and possibly dangerous assistance For this reason some legislations such as \" \n Good Samaritan Laws \n \" limit \n liability \n for those attempting to provide medical services and non-medical services in an emergency \n Organizational ombuds practitioners' research \n A study published by \n International Ombudsman Association \n in the Journal of the International Ombudsman Association suggests thatin realitythere are dozens of reasons why people do not act on the spot or come forward in the workplace when they see behavior they consider unacceptable \n The most important reasons cited for not acting were the fear of loss of important relationships in and out of the workplace and a fear of \"bad consequences \" There also were many reasons given by people who did act on the spot or come forward to authorities \n This practitioners' study suggests that the \"bystander effect\" can be studied and analyzed in a much broader fashion The broader view includes not just a what bystanders do in singular emergencies b helping strangers in need when c there are or are not other people around The reactions of bystanders can also be analyzed a when the bystanders perceive any of a wide variety of unacceptable behavior over time b they are within an organizational context and c with people whom they know The practitioners' study reported many reasons why some bystanders within organizations do not act or report unacceptable behavior The study also suggests that bystander behavior is in fact often helpful in terms of \n acting on the spot to help \n and \n reporting \n unacceptable behavior and emergencies and people in need The ombuds practitioners' study suggests that what bystanders will do in real situations is actually very complex reflecting views of the context and their managers and relevant organizational structures if any and also many personal reasons \n In support of the idea that some bystanders do indeed act responsibly \n Gerald Koocher \n and Patricia Keith Spiegel wrote a article related to an NIH-funded study which showed that informal intervention by peers and bystanders can interrupt or remedy unacceptable scientific behavior \n What Would You Do? \n John Quiones' primetime show \n What Would You Do? \n on ABC tests the bystander effect Actors are used to act out typically non-emergency situations while the cameras capture the reactions and actions of innocent bystanders Topics include cheating on a millionaire test an elderly person \n shoplifting \n racism \n and \n homophobia \n Non-computer versus computers computer mediated intervention \n Research suggests that the bystander effect may be present in \n computer-mediated communication \n situations \n Evidence demonstrates that people can be bystanders even when they cannot see the person in distress In the experiment online chat groups were observed One of two confederates were used as victims in each chat room either a male victim whose screen name was Jake Harmen or a female victim whose screen name was Suzy Harmen The purpose of the experiment was to determine whether or not the gender of the victim mattered if the size of each chat group had any effect and if asking for a person's help by directly using their screen name would have any effect Results indicated that the gender of the victim had no effect on whether or not a bystander assisted the victim Consistent with findings of Latan and Darley the number of people present in the chat room did have an effect The response time for smaller chat groups was quicker than in the larger chat groups However this effect was nonexistent when the victim Suzy or Jake asked for help from a specific person in the chat group The mean response time for groups in which a specific person was called out was seconds The mean response time for groups in which no screen name was pointed out was seconds A significant finding of the research is that intervention depends on whether or not a victim asked for help by specifying a screen name The group size effect was inhibited when the victim specifically asked a specific person for help The group size effect was not inhibited if the victim did not ask a specific person for help \n Children as bystanders \n Although most research has been conducted on adults children can be bystanders too A study conducted by Robert Thornberg in came up with seven reasons why children do not help when another classmate is in distress These include \n trivialisation \n dissociation \n embarrassment association busy working priority compliance with a competitive norm audience modelling and responsibility transfer \n jargon \n In a further study Thornberg concluded that there are seven stages of moral deliberation as a bystander in bystander situations among the Swedish schoolchildren he observed and interviewed a \n noticing that something is wrong \n i e children pay selective attention to their environment and sometimes they don't tune in on a distressed peer if they're in a hurry or their view is obstructed b \n interpreting a need for help \n sometimes children think others are just playing rather than actually in distress or they display pluralistic ignorance c \n feeling empathy \n i e having tuned in on a situation and concluded that help is needed children might feel sorry for an injured peer or angry about unwarranted aggression empathic anger d \n processing the school's moral frames \n Thornberg identified five contextual ingredients influencing children's behavior in bystander situations the definition of a good student tribe caring gender stereotypes and social-hierarchy-dependent morality e \n scanning for social status and relations \n i e students were less likely to intervene if they didn't define themselves as friends of the victim or belonging to the same significant social category as the victim or if there were high-status students present or involved as aggressorsconversely lower-status children were more likely to intervene if only a few other low-status children were around f \n condensing motives for action \n such as considering a number of factors such as possible benefits and costs and g \n acting \n i e all of the above coalesced into a decision to intervene or not It is striking how this was less an individual decision than the product of a set of interpersonal and institutional processes \n Implications of research \n South African murder trials \n In an effort to make \n South African \n courts more just in their convictions the concept of \n extenuating circumstances \n came into being \n However no concrete definition of extenuating circumstances was ever made The South African courts began using the testimony of expert social psychologists to define what extenuating circumstances would mean in the \n justice \n system Examples include \n deindividuation \n bystander apathy and \n conformity \n In the case of \n S vs Sibisi and Others \n eight members of the \n South African Railways and Harbours Union \n were involved in the murder of four workers who chose not to join in the SARHWU strike Psychologists Scott Fraser and Andrew Colman presented evidence for the defense using research from \n social psychology \n Social anthropologist \n Boet Kotz provided evidence for the defense as well He testified that \n African cultures \n are characterized by a \n collective consciousness \n Kotz testified that the collective conscious contributed to the defendants' willingness to act with the group rather than act as individuals Fraser and Colman stated that \n bystander apathy \n deindividuation \n conformity \n and \n group polarization \n were extenuating factors in the killing of the four strike breakers They explained that deindividuation may affect group members' ability to realize that they are still accountable for their individual actions even when with a group They also used research on bystander apathy by Latan and Darley to illustrate why four of the eight defendants watched as the other four defendants killed four men The testimonies of Fraser and Colman helped four of the defendants escape the death penalty \n Laws \n Some parts of the world have included laws that hold bystanders responsible when they witness an emergency \n The \n Charter of human rights and freedoms \n of \n Quebec \n states that \" e very person must come to the aid of anyone whose life is in peril either personally or calling for aid unless it involves danger to himself or a third person or he has another valid reason\" \n It is therefore a legal obligation to assist people in danger in Quebec \n Likewise the Brazilian Penal Code states that it is a crime not to rescue or call emergency services when appropriate injured or disabled people including those found under grave and imminent danger as long as it safe to do so This also includes abandoned children \n The German penal code makes it a crime for a person to fail to render aid in cases of accidents or other common dangers unless such person would thereby endanger themselves or it would be contrary to some other important obligation \n In the US \n Good Samaritan laws \n have been implemented to protect bystanders who acted in good faith Many organizations are including bystander training For example the United States Department of the Army is doing bystander training with respect to sexual assault Some organizations routinely do bystander training with respect to safety issues Others have been doing bystander training with respect to diversity issues \n Organizations such as American universities are also using bystander research to improve bystander attitudes in cases of rape Examples include the InterAct Sexual Assault Prevention program \n and the Green Dot program \n Others have been critical of these laws for being punitive and criminalizing the problem they are meant to address \n Many institutions have worked to provide options for bystanders who see behavior they find unacceptable These options are usually provided through \n complaint systems \n so bystanders have choices about where to go One option that is particularly helpful is that of an \n organizational ombudsman \n who keeps no records for the employer and is near-absolutely confidential \n Notable examples \n Kitty Genovese \n Murder of Kitty Genovese \n The \n case of Kitty Genovese \n is often cited and occasionally criticized as an example of the \"bystander effect\" It is also the case that originally stimulated social psychological research in this area On March Genovese years old was on her way back to her apartment in Queens New York from work at 3am when she was stabbed sexually assaulted and murdered in front of multiple witnesses \n According to newspaper accounts the attack lasted for at least a half an hour during which time Genovese screamed and pleaded for help The murderer attacked Genovese and stabbed her then fled the scene after attracting the attention of a neighbor The killer then returned ten minutes later and finished the assault Newspaper reports after Genovese's death claimed that witnesses watched the stabbings and failed to intervene or even contact the police until after the attacker fled and Genovese had died This led to widespread public attention and many editorials Psychology researchers Latan and Darley attributed the lack of help by witnesses to \n diffusion of responsibility \n because each witness saw others witnessing the same event they assumed that the others would be taking responsibility and calling the police and therefore did nothing to stop the situation themselves \n According to an article published in \n American Psychologist \n in the original story of Genovese's murder was exaggerated by the media Specifically there were not eyewitnesses the police were contacted at least once during the attack and many of the bystanders who overheard the attack could not actually see the event The authors of the article suggest that the story continues to be misrepresented in social psychology textbooks because it functions as a \n parable \n and serves as a dramatic example for students \n Raymond Zack \n Death of Raymond Zack \n On \n Memorial Day \n 53-year-old Raymond Zack of \n Alameda California \n walked into the waters off Robert Crown Memorial Beach and stood neck deep in water roughly yards offshore for almost an hour His foster mother Dolores Berry called 9-1-1 and said that he was trying to drown himself There are conflicting reports about Zack's intentions \n Firefighters and police responded but did not enter the water The firefighters called for a United States Coast Guard boat to respond to the scene According to police reports Alameda police expected the firefighters to enter the water \n Firefighters later said that they did not have current training and certifications to perform land-based water rescue Dozens of civilians on the beach and watching from their homes across from the beach did not enter the water apparently expecting public safety officers to conduct a rescue Eventually Zack collapsed in the water apparently from hypothermia Even then nobody entered the water for several minutes Finally a \n good samaritan \n entered the water and pulled Zack to shore Zack died afterwards at a local hospital \n Wang Yue \n Death of Wang Yue \n In October a 2-year-old girl Wang Yue was hit by a small white van in the city of \n Foshan \n China then run over by a large truck when she was not moved by bystanders A total of people ignored her some going so far as to walk around the blood The girl was left for seven minutes before a recycler Chen Xianmei picked up the toddler and called for help The child died eight days later \n Reversal of bystander effect \n Role of public self-awareness \n In many cases we believe that individuals like to view themselves as noble by offering help This concept is related to the notion of self-awareness If it is true that people focus on the impression they make on others then public-awareness through the use of accountability cues can stimulate people to give help to each other However being surrounded by a lot of bystanders does not automatically create public self-awareness In fact in some cases being surrounded by bystanders allows an individual to hide within the crowd and feel anonymous According to Dr van Bommel by introducing an accountability cue the aim is to eliminate feelings of anonymity and increase the likelihood of them offering help \n Experiments \n To investigate if people would help others in the presence of bystanders alone or when introducing an accountability cue van Bommel \n set out to perform two experiments For the first experiment participants were invited to join an online forum A sample of students was used and in the forum participants saw their own name and the names of the other people that were online in the left upper half of the screen To operationalize the accountability cue participants' names were displayed in either red or black Red salient condition utilized to attract attention and stand out was used to raise public self-awareness while black non-salient was used for participants to have the same color as other bystanders In random order five different messages were presented to the participants Each of these messages was a personal story of a person in distress The number of responses a participant typed measured the helping behavior from participants and as expected the results showed that names in black non-salient condition were linked to the bystander effect with the amount of help being However when names were in the red salient condition the bystander effect was reversed with the amount of help being This exemplifies the role of self-awareness in the reversal of bystander effect \n In order to further investigate the reversal of the bystander effect van Bommel performed a second experiment also reported in the article with a sample size of students Unlike the first study they wanted all participants in the forum to be indistinguishable from other bystanders on the forum Therefore the manipulation of public self-awareness was induced independently from the Internet forum The procedure was identical to the first study with a few variations To induce public awareness in this study webcams were mounted on participants computers Participants could not see the video feed but to make this more salient they asked participants before they started to check whether the camera was on by looking at a LED-indicator underneath the webcam To make the conditions resemble each other as close as possible they asked participants in the camera absent condition to check if the LED-indicator for Num-Lock was on Similar to the first experiment five different messages were presented to the participants and the number of responses a participant typed measured the helping behavior from participants Once again the results were as expected When the camera was not present the bystander effect existed with the average amount of help being However when a camera was present the bystander effect was reversed with the amount of help doubling to That said the findings revealed the importance of public self-awareness in
