* edit * * * Social Influence is a broad term that relates to many different phenomena * Listed below are some major types of social influence that are being researched in the field of * social psychology * * For more information * follow the main article links provided * * Kelman's varieties * * * edit * * * There are three processes of * attitude change * as defined by Harvard psychologist * Herbert Kelman * in a  *  paper published in the * Journal of Conflict Resolution * * * *  *  * * The purpose of defining these processes was to help determine the effects of social influence * for example * to separate public conformity * behavior * from private acceptance * personal belief * * Compliance * * * edit * * * Main article * * Compliance * psychology * * Compliance is the act of responding favorably to an explicit or implicit request offered by others * Technically * compliance is a change in * behavior * but not necessarily in * attitude * * one can comply due to mere * obedience * or by otherwise opting to withhold private thoughts due to social pressures * * *  *  * * According to Kelman's  *  paper * the satisfaction derived from compliance is due to the social effect of the accepting influence * i * e * people comply for an expected reward or punishment-aversion * * *  *  * * Identification * * * edit * * * Main article * * Identification * psychology * * Identification is the changing of attitudes or behaviors due to the influence of someone who is admired * * Advertisements * that rely upon * celebrity * endorsements to market their products are taking advantage of this phenomenon * According to Kelman * the desired relationship that the identifier relates to the behavior or attitude change * * *  *  * * Internalization * * * edit * * * Main article * * Internalization * Internalization is the process of acceptance of a set of norms established by people or groups that are influential to the individual * The individual accepts the influence because the content of the influence accepted is intrinsically rewarding * It is congruent with the individual's value system * and according to Kelman the \"reward\" of internalization is \"the content of the new behavior\" * * *  *  * * Conformity * * * edit * * * Main article * * Conformity * Conformity is a type of social influence involving a change in behavior * belief * or thinking to align with those of others or with normative standards * It is the most common and pervasive form of social influence * * Social psychology * research in conformity tends to distinguish between two varieties * * informational conformity * * also called * social proof * * or \"internalization\" in Kelman's terms * and * normative conformity * * \"compliance\" in Kelman's terms * * *  *  * * In the case of * peer pressure * * a person is convinced to do something that they might not want to do * such as taking * illegal drugs * * but which they perceive as \"necessary\" to keep a positive * relationship * with other people * such as their * friends * * Conformity from peer pressure generally results from identification with the group members or from compliance of some members to appease others * * Conformity can be in appearance * or may be more complete in nature * impacting an individual both publicly and privately * * Compliance * also referred to as acquiescence * demonstrates a public conformity to a group majority or norm * while the individual continues to privately disagree or dissent * holding on to their original beliefs or to an alternative set of beliefs differing from the majority * Compliance appears as conformity * but there is a division between the public and the private self * * Conversion includes the private acceptance that is absent in compliance * The individual's original behaviour * beliefs * or thinking changes to align with that of others * the influencers * both publicly and privately * The individual has accepted the behavior * belief * or thinking * and has internalized it * making it his own * Conversion may also refer to individual members of a group changing from their initial * and varied * opinions to adopt the opinions of others * which may differ from their original opinions * The resulting group position may be a hybrid of various aspects of individual initial opinions * or it may be an alternative independent of the initial positions reached through consensus * * What appears to be conformity may in fact be congruence * Congruence occurs when an individual's behavior * belief * or thinking is already aligned with that of the others * and no change occurs * * In situations where conformity * including compliance * conversion * and congruence * is absent * there are non-conformity processes such as independence and anti-conformity * Independence * also referred to as dissent * involves an individual * either through their actions or lack of action * or through the public expression of their beliefs or thinking * being aligned with their personal standards but inconsistent with those of other members of the group * either all of the group or a majority * Anti-conformity * also referred to as counter-conformity * may appear as independence * but it lacks alignment with personal standards and is for the purpose of challenging the group * Actions as well as stated opinions and beliefs are often diametrically opposed to that of the group norm or majority * The underlying reasons for this type of behavior may be rebelliousness/obstinacy or it may be to ensure that all alternatives and view points are given due consideration * * *  *  * * Minority influence * * * edit * * * Main article * * Minority influence * Minority influence takes place when a majority is influenced to accept the beliefs or behaviors of a minority * Minority influence can be affected by the sizes of majority and minority groups * the level of consistency of the minority group * and situational factors * such as the affluence or social importance of the minority * * *  *  * * Minority influence most often operates through * informational social influence * * as opposed to * normative social influence * * because the majority may be indifferent to the liking of the minority * * *  *  * * Self-fulfilling prophecy * * * edit * * * Main article * * Self-fulfilling prophecy * A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true due to positive feedback between * belief * and * behavior * * A prophecy declared as truth * when it is actually false * may sufficiently influence people * either through fear or logical confusion * so that their reactions ultimately fulfill the once-false prophecy * This term is credited to * sociologist * Robert K * Merton * from an article he published in  *  * * *  *  * * Reactance * * * edit * * * Main article * * Reactance * psychology * * Reactance is the adoption of a view contrary to the view that a person is being pressured to accept * perhaps due to a perceived threat to behavioral freedoms * This phenomenon has also been called * anticonformity * * While the results are the opposite of what the influencer intended * the reactive behavior is a result of * social pressure * * * *  *  * * It is notable that anticonformity does not necessarily mean * independence * * In many studies * reactance manifests itself in a deliberate rejection of an influence * even if the influence is clearly correct * * *  *  * * Obedience * * * edit * * * Main article * * Obedience * human behavior * * Obedience is a form of social influence that derives from an authority figure * The * Milgram experiment * * Zimbardo's * Stanford prison experiment * * and the * Hofling hospital experiment * are three particularly well-known experiments on obedience * and they all conclude that humans are surprisingly obedient in the presence of perceived legitimate authority figures * * Persuasion * * * edit * * * Main article * * Persuasion * Persuasion is the process of guiding oneself or another toward the adoption of an attitude by rational or symbolic means * * Robert Cialdini * defined six \"weapons of influence\" * * reciprocity * * commitment * * social proof * * * authority * * liking * and * scarcity * * These \"weapons of influence\" attempt to bring about conformity by directed means * Persuasion can occur through * appeals to reason * or * appeals to emotion * * * *  *  * * Psychological manipulation * * * edit * * * Main article * * Psychological manipulation * Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the behavior or * perception * of others through * abusive * * * deceptive * * or underhanded tactics * * *  *  * * By advancing the interests of the manipulator * often at another's expense * such methods could be considered exploitative * abusive * devious * and deceptive * * Social influence is not necessarily negative * For example * doctors can try to * persuade * patients to change unhealthy habits * Social influence is generally perceived to be harmless when it respects the right of the influenced to accept or reject it * and is not unduly coercive * Depending on the context and motivations * social influence may constitute underhanded manipulation * * Abusive power and control * * * edit * * * Main article * * Abusive power and control * Controlling abusers use tactics to exert power and control over their victims * The goal of the abuser is to control and * intimidate * the victim or to influence them to feel that they do not have an equal voice in the relationship * * *  *  * * Propaganda * * * edit * * * Main article * * Propaganda * Propaganda is information that is not * objective * and is used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda * often by presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception * or using * loaded language * to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is presented * * *  *  * * Hard power * * * edit * * * Main article * * Hard power * Hard power is the use of * military * and * economic * means to influence the behavior or interests of other political bodies * This form of * political power * is often aggressive * * coercion * * and is most effective when imposed by one political body upon another of lesser military and/or economic power * * *  *  * * Hard power contrasts with * soft power * * which comes from * diplomacy * * * culture * and * history * * * *  *  * * Antecedents * * * edit * * * Many factors can affect the impact of social influence * * Social impact theory * * * edit * * * Main article * * Social impact theory * Social impact theory was developed by * Bibb Latan * in  *  * This theory asserts that there are three factors which increase a person's likelihood to respond to social influence * * *  *  * * Strength * * The importance of the influencing group to the individual * Immediacy * * Physical * and temporal * proximity of the influencing group to the individual at the time of the influence attempt * Number * * The number of people in the group * Cialdini's \"weapons of influence\" * * * edit * * * Robert Cialdini * defines six \"weapons of influence\" that can contribute to an individual's propensity to be influenced by a persuader * * *  *  * * *  *  * * Reciprocity * * People tend to return a favor * * Commitment * and * consistency * * People do not like to be self-contradictory * Once they commit to an idea or behavior * they are averse to changing their minds without good reason * * Social proof * * People will be more open to things that they see others doing * For example * seeing others compost their organic waste after finishing a meal may influence the subject to do so as well * * *  *  * * Authority * * People will tend to obey authority figures * * Liking * People are more easily swayed by people they like * * Scarcity * * A perceived limitation of resources will generate demand * * Unanimity * * * edit * * * Social Influence is strongest when the group perpetrating it is consistent and committed * Even a single instance of dissent can greatly wane the strength of an influence * For example * in Milgram's first set of * obedience experiments * * 65% of participants complied with fake authority figures to administer \"maximum shocks\" to a confederate * In iterations of the Milgram experiment where three people administered shocks * two of whom were confederates * once one confederate disobeyed * only ten percent of subjects administered the maximum shocks * * *  *  * * Status * * * edit * * * Main article * * Appeal to authority * See also * * Reputation * Those perceived as * experts * may exert social influence as a result of their perceived expertise * This involves * credibility * * a tool of social influence from which one draws upon the notion of trust * People believe an individual to be credible for a variety of reasons * such as perceived experience * attractiveness * knowledge * etc * Additionally * pressure to maintain one's reputation and not be viewed as fringe may increase the tendency to agree with the group * This phenomenon is known as * groupthink * * * *  *  * * Appeals to authority may especially affect norms of * obedience * * The compliance of normal humans to authority in the famous * Milgram experiment * demonstrate the * power * of perceived authority * * Those with access to the media may use this access in an attempt to influence the public * For example * a politician may use speeches to persuade the public to support issues that he or she does not have the power to impose on the public * This is often referred to as using the \" * bully pulpit * * \" Likewise * celebrities don't usually possess any political power * but they are familiar to many of the world's citizens and * therefore * possess * social status * * * Power is one of the biggest reasons an individual feels the need to follow through with the suggestions of another * A person who possesses more authority * or is perceived as being more powerful * than others in a group is an icon or is most \"popular\" within a group * This person has the most influence over others * For example * in a child's school life * people who seem to control the perceptions of the students at school are most powerful in having a social influence over other children * * *  *  * * Culture * * * edit * * * Culture * appears to play a role in the willingness of an individual to conform to the standards of a group * * Stanley Milgram * found that conformity was higher in * Norway * than in * France * * * *  *  * * This has been attributed to Norway's longstanding tradition of social responsibility * compared to France's cultural focus on individualism * Japan likewise has a collectivist culture and thus a higher propensity to conformity * However * a  *  * Asch-style study * found that when alienated * Japanese students were more susceptible to * anticonformity * * giving answers that were * incorrect * even when the group had collaborated on * correct * answers * one third of the time * significantly higher than has been seen in Asch studies in the past * * *  *  * * While * gender * does not significantly affect a person's likelihood to conform * under certain conditions * gender roles * do affect such a likelihood * Studies from the 1950s and 1960s concluded that women were more likely to conform than men * But a  *  study found that * experimenter bias * was involved * all of the researchers were male * while all of the research participants were female * Studies thereafter found that the likelihood to conform almost equal between the genders * Furthermore * men conformed more often when faced with traditionally feminine topics * and women conformed more often when presented with masculine topics * In other words * ignorance about a subject can lead a person to defer to * \"social proof\" * * * *  *  * * Emotions * * * edit * * * Main article * * Appeal to emotion * Emotion and disposition may affect an individual's likelihood of conformity or anticonformity * * *  *  * * In  *  * a study concluded that fear increases the chance of agreeing with a group * while romance or lust increases the chance of going against the group * * *  *  * * Social structure * * * edit * * * Social networks * * * edit * * * Main article * * Social network analysis * A * social network * is a * social structure * made up of nodes * representing individuals or organizations * which are connected * through * ties * * also called * edges * * * connections * * or * links * * by one or more types of interdependency * such as friendship * common interests or beliefs * sexual relations * or kinship * * Social network analysis * uses the lens of * network theory * to examine * social relationships * * Social network analysis as a field has become more prominent since the mid-20th century in determining the channels and effects of social influence * For example * * Christakis * and * Fowler * found that social networks transmit states and behaviors such as obesity * * *  *  * * smoking * * *  *  * * *  *  * * drinking * *  *  * * and happiness * * *  *  * * Identifying the extent of social influence * based on large-scale observational data with a latent * social network * structure * is pertinent to a variety of collective social phenomena including * crime * * * civil unrest * * and * voting behavior * in elections * For example * methodologies for disentangling social influence by peers from external influences with latent social network structures and large-scale observational data were applied to US presidential elections * * *  *  * * *  *  * * stock markets * * * *  *  * * and * civil unrest * * * *  *  * *  *  * * * edit * * * Authority bias * Bystander effect * Impression management * Judge advisor system * Mind shaping"}
