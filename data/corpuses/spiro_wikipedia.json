where \"individuals engage raw and semi-raw materials and component parts to produce transform or reconstruct material possessions including those drawn from the natural environment e g landscaping \" \n DIY behavior can be triggered by various motivations previously categorized as \n marketplace \n motivations economic benefits lack of product availability lack of product quality need for customization and \n identity \n enhancement craftsmanship empowerment community seeking uniqueness \n The term \"do-it-yourself\" has been associated with consumers since at least primarily in the domain of home improvement and maintenance activities \n The phrase \"do it yourself\" had come into common usage in standard English by the 1950s \n in reference to the emergence of a trend of people undertaking \n home improvement \n and various other small craft and construction projects as both a creative-recreational and cost-saving activity \n Subsequently the term DIY has taken on a broader meaning that covers a wide range of skill sets DIY is associated with the international \n alternative rock \n punk rock \n and \n indie rock \n music scenes \n indymedia \n networks \n pirate radio \n stations and the \n zine \n community In this context DIY is related to the \n Arts and Crafts movement \n in that it offers an alternative to modern \n consumer culture \n 's emphasis on relying on others to satisfy needs The abbreviation DIY is also widely used in the military as a way to teach commanders or other types of units to take responsibility so that they'd be able to do things themselves just as a preparation for their own future \n Home improvement \n Fashion \n Subculture \n Groups and Publications \n Italian archaeologists unearthed the ruins of a 6th-century BC \n Greek \n structure in southern Italy that came with detailed assembly instructions and is being called an \"ancient \n IKEA \n building\" The structure was a \n temple-like \n building discovered at \n Torre Satriano \n near the southern city of \n Potenza \n in \n Basilicata \n a region where local people mingled with \n Greeks \n who settled along the southern coast known as \n Magna Graecia \n and in \n Sicily \n from the 8th century BC onwards Professor Christopher Smith director of the \n British School at Rome \n said that the discovery was \"the clearest example yet found of mason's marks of the time It looks as if someone was instructing others how to mass-produce components and put them together in this way\" Much like the instruction booklets various sections of the luxury building were inscribed with coded symbols showing how the pieces slotted together The characteristics of these inscriptions indicate they date back to around the 6th century BC which tallies with the architectural evidence suggested by the decoration The building was built by Greek artisans coming from the \n Spartan \n colony of \n Taranto \n in \n Apulia \n Home improvement \n Home improvement \n Shelves attached to a toy vehicle \n The DIY movement is a re-introduction often to urban and suburban dwellers of the old pattern of personal involvement and use of skills in upkeep of a house or apartment making clothes maintenance of cars computers websites or any material aspect of living The philosopher \n Alan Watts \n from the \" \n Houseboat Summit \n \" panel discussion in a edition of the \n San Francisco Oracle \n reflected a growing sentiment \n Our educational system in its entirety does nothing to give us any kind of material competence In other words we don't learn how to cook how to make clothes how to build houses how to make love or to do any of the absolutely fundamental things of life The whole education that we get for our children in school is entirely in terms of abstractions It trains you to be an insurance salesman or a bureaucrat or some kind of cerebral character \n In the 1970s DIY spread through the North American population of college- and recent-college-graduate age groups In part this movement involved the renovation of affordable rundown older homes But it also related to various projects expressing the social and environmental vision of the 1960s and early 1970s The young visionary \n Stewart Brand \n working with friends and family and initially using the most basic of typesetting and page-layout tools published the first edition of \n The \n Whole Earth Catalog \n subtitled \n Access to Tools \n in late \n Fiberglass dome house California in style of the Whole Earth Catalog building techniques \n The first \n Catalog \n and its successors used a broad definition of the term \"tools\" There were informational tools such as books often technical in nature professional journals courses classes and the like There were specialized designed items such as \n carpenters \n ' and \n masons \n ' tools \n garden tools \n welding \n equipment \n chainsaws \n fiberglass materials and so on even early personal computers The designer \n J Baldwin \n acted as editor to include such items writing many of the reviews The \n Catalog' \n s publication both emerged from and spurred the great wave of experimentalism convention-breaking and do-it-yourself attitude of the late 1960s Often copied the \n Catalog \n appealed to a wide cross-section of people in North America and had a broad influence \n For decades magazines such as \n Popular Mechanics \n and \n Mechanix Illustrated \n offered a way for readers to keep current on useful practical skills and techniques DIY home improvement books began to flourish in the 1970s first created as collections of magazine articles An early extensive line of DIY how-to books was created by \n Sunset Books \n based upon previously published articles from their magazine \n Sunset \n based in California \n Time-Life \n Better Homes and Gardens \n and other publishers soon followed suit \n Electronics World \n home assembled amplifier \n In the mid-1990s

through thousands of sites \n In the 1970s when home video \n VCRs \n came along DIY instructors quickly grasped its potential for demonstrating processes by audio-visual means In the \n PBS \n television series \n This Old House \n starring \n Bob Vila \n premiered and this spurred a DIY television revolution The show was immensely popular educating people on how to improve their living conditions and the value of their house without the expense of paying someone else to do as much of the work In the \n HGTV \n Network cable television channel was launched in the United States and Canada followed in by the \n DIY Network \n cable television channel Both were launched to appeal to the growing percentage of North Americans interested in DIY topics from \n home improvement \n to

defined simply as a \"new idea device or method\" \n However innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements unarticulated needs or existing market needs \n This is accomplished through more-effective \n products \n processes \n services \n technologies \n or business models that are readily available to \n markets \n governments \n and \n society \n The term \"innovation\" can be defined as something original and more effective and as a consequence new that \"breaks into\" the market or society \n It is related to but not the same as \n invention \n Innovation is often manifested via the \n engineering \n process The opposite of innovation is \n exnovation \n While a novel device is often described as an innovation in economics management science and other fields of practice and analysis innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in a way that they affect society In \n industrial economics \n innovations are created and found empirically from services to meet the growing \n consumer \n demand \n Definition \n Inter-disciplinary views \n Business and economics \n Organizations \n Sources \n Goals and failures \n Diffusion \n Measures \n Organizational level \n Political level \n Indicators \n Indices \n Rankings \n Future \n Innovation and international development \n Government policies \n Definition \n A survey of literature on innovation found over definitions In an industrial survey of how the \n software industry \n defined innovation the following definition given by Crossan and Apaydin was considered to be the most complete which builds on the \n Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD \n manual's definition \n Innovation is production or adoption assimilation and exploitation of a value-added novelty in economic and social spheres renewal and enlargement of products services and markets development of new methods of production and establishment of new management systems It is both a process and an outcome \n Two main dimensions of innovation were degree of \n novelty patent \n i e whether an innovation is new to the firm new to the market new to the industry and new to the world and type of innovation whether it is process or \n product-service system \n innovation \n Inter-disciplinary views \n Business and economics \n innovation economics \n In business and economics innovation can be a catalyst to growth With rapid advancements in \n transportation \n and \n communications \n over the past few decades the old world concepts of \n factor endowments \n and \n comparative advantage \n which focused on an areas unique inputs are outmoded for todays \n global economy \n Economist \n Joseph Schumpeter \n who contributed greatly to the study of \n innovation economics \n argued that industries must incessantly revolutionize the economic structure from within that is innovate with better or more effective processes and products as well as market distribution such as the connection from the craft shop to factory He famously asserted that \" \n creative destruction \n is the essential fact about \n capitalism \n \" \n In addition \n entrepreneurs \n continuously look for better ways to satisfy their \n consumer base \n with improved quality durability service and price which come to fruition in innovation with advanced technologies and organizational strategies \n One prime example was the explosive boom of \n Silicon Valley \n startups out of the \n Stanford Industrial Park \n In dissatisfied employees of \n Shockley Semiconductor \n the company of \n Nobel laureate \n and co-inventor of the \n transistor \n William Shockley \n left to form an independent firm \n Fairchild Semiconductor \n After several years Fairchild developed into a formidable presence in the sector Eventually these founders left to start their own companies based on their own unique latest ideas and then leading employees started their own firms Over the next years this snowball process launched the momentous \n startup company \n explosion of \n information technology \n firms Essentially Silicon Valley began as new enterprises born out of Shockleys eight former employees \n Since then hubs of innovation have sprung up globally with similar \n metonyms \n including \n Silicon Alley \n encompassing \n New York City \n Another example is the \n Business Incubators \n - a phenomenon that is nurtured by governments around the world close to knowledge clusters mostly research based like universities or other Government Excellence Centres while the main goal is to channel the generated knowledge to applied innovation outcomes in order to stimulate regional or national \n economic growth \n Organizations \n In the organizational context innovation may be linked to positive changes in \n efficiency \n productivity \n quality \n competitiveness \n and \n market share \n However recent research findings highlight the complementary role of organizational culture in enabling organizations to translate innovative activity into tangible performance improvements \n Organizations can also improve profits and performance by providing work groups opportunities and resources to innovate in addition to employee's core job tasks \n Peter Drucker \n wrote \n Innovation is the specific function of entrepreneurship whether in an existing business a public service institution or a new venture started by a lone individual in the family kitchen It is the means by which the entrepreneur either creates new wealth-producing resources or endows existing resources with enhanced potential for creating wealth Drucker \n According to Clayton Christensen \n disruptive innovation \n is the key to future success in business \n The organisation requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage It is necessary to create and nurture an environment of innovation Executives and managers need to break away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage It is a time of risk but even greater opportunity \n The world of work is changing with the increase in the use of technology and both companies and businesses are becoming increasingly competitive Companies will have to downsize and re-engineer their operations to remain competitive This will affect employment as businesses will be forced to reduce the number of people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more \n While disruptive innovation will typically \"attack a traditional business model with a lower-cost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly \" \n foundational innovation is slower and typically has the potential to create new foundations for global technology systems over the longer term Foundational innovation tends to transform business \n operating models \n as entirely new business models \n emerge \n over many years with gradual and steady adoption of the innovation leading to waves of \n technological \n and \n institutional \n change that gain momentum more slowly \n The advent of the \n packet-switched \n communication protocol \n TCP/IP \n originally introduced in to support a single \n use case \n for \n United States Department of Defense \n electronic communication email and which gained widespread adoption only in the mid-1990s with the advent of the \n World Wide Web \n is a foundational technology \n All organizations can innovate including for example hospitals universities and local governments \n For instance former Mayor \n Martin OMalley \n pushed the \n City of Baltimore \n to use \n CitiStat \n a \n performance-measurement \n data and management system that allows city officials to maintain statistics on crime trends to condition of \n pothole \n s This system aids in better evaluation of policies and procedures with accountability and efficiency in terms of time and money In its first year CitiStat saved the city $13 million \n Even \n mass transit \n systems have innovated with \n hybrid \n bus fleets to \n real-time tracking \n at bus stands In addition the growing use of \n mobile data terminals \n in vehicles that serve as communication hubs between vehicles and a control center automatically send data on location passenger counts engine performance mileage and other information This tool helps to deliver and manage transportation systems \n Still other innovative strategies include \n hospitals \n digitizing medical information in \n electronic medical records \n For example the \n U S Department of Housing and Urban Development \n 's \n HOPE VI \n initiatives turned severely distressed \n public housing \n in urban areas into \n revitalized \n mixed-income environments the \n Harlem Childrens Zone \n used a community-based approach to educate local area children and the \n Environmental Protection Agency \n 's \n brownfield grants \n facilitates turning over \n brownfields \n for \n environmental protection \n green spaces \n community \n and \n commercial development \n Sources \n There are several sources of innovation It can occur as a result of a focus effort by a range of different agents by chance or as a result of a major system failure \n According to \n Peter F Drucker \n the general sources of innovations are different changes in industry structure in market structure in local and global demographics in human perception mood and meaning in the amount of already available scientific knowledge etc \n Original model of three phases of the process of Technological Change \n In the simplest \n linear model of innovation \n the traditionally recognized source is \n manufacturer innovation \n This is where an agent person or business innovates in order to sell the innovation Specifically R&D measurement is the commonly used input for innovation in particular in the business sector named Business Expenditure on R&D BERD that grew over the years on the expenses of the declining R&D invested by the public sector \n Another source of innovation only now becoming widely recognized is \n end-user innovation \n This is where an agent person or company develops an innovation for their own personal or in-house use because existing products do not meet their needs \n MIT \n economist \n Eric von Hippel \n has identified end-user innovation as by far the most important and critical in his classic book on the subject \n The Sources of Innovation \n The robotics engineer \n Joseph F Engelberger \n asserts that innovations require only three things \n A recognized need \n Competent people with relevant technology and \n Financial support \n However innovation processes usually involve identifying customer needs macro and meso trends developing competences and finding financial support \n The Kline \n chain-linked model \n of innovation \n places emphasis on potential market needs as drivers of the innovation process and describes the complex and often iterative feedback loops between marketing design manufacturing and R&D \n Innovation by businesses is achieved in many ways with much attention now given to formal \n research and development \n R&D for \"breakthrough innovations\" R&D help spur on patents and other scientific innovations that leads to productive growth in such areas as industry medicine engineering and government \n Yet innovations can be developed by less formal on-the-job modifications of practice through exchange and combination of professional experience and by many other routes Investigation of relationship between the concepts of innovation and technology transfer revealed overlap \n The more radical and revolutionary innovations tend to emerge from R&D while more incremental innovations may emerge from practice but there are many exceptions to each of these trends \n Information technology \n and changing business processes and management style can produce a work climate favorable to innovation \n For example the software tool company \n Atlassian \n conducts quarterly \"ShipIt Days\" in which employees may work on anything related to the company's products \n Google employees work on self-directed projects for 20% of their time known as \n Innovation Time Off \n Both companies cite these bottom-up processes as major sources for new products and features \n An important innovation factor includes customers buying products or using services As a result firms may incorporate users in \n focus groups \n user centred approach work closely with so called \n lead users \n lead user approach or users might adapt their products themselves The lead user method focuses on idea generation based on leading users to develop breakthrough innovations U-STIR a project to innovate \n Europe \n s surface \n transportation \n system employs such workshops \n Regarding this \n user innovation \n a great deal of innovation is done by those actually implementing and using technologies and products as part of their normal activities Sometimes user-innovators may become \n entrepreneurs \n selling their product they may choose to trade their innovation in exchange for other innovations or they may be adopted by their suppliers Nowadays they may also choose to freely reveal their innovations using methods like \n open source \n In such networks of innovation the users or communities of users can further develop technologies and reinvent their social meaning \n Goals and failures \n Programs of organizational innovation are typically tightly linked to organizational goals and objectives to the \n business plan \n and to \n market \n competitive positioning \n One driver for innovation programs in corporations is to achieve growth objectives As Davila et al notes \"Companies cannot grow through cost reduction and reengineering alone Innovation is the key element in providing aggressive top-line growth and for increasing bottom-line results\" \n One survey across a large number of manufacturing and services organizations found ranked in decreasing order of popularity that systematic programs of organizational innovation are most frequently driven by Improved \n quality \n Creation of new \n markets \n Extension of the \n product \n range Reduced \n labor costs \n Improved \n production processes \n Reduced materials Reduced \n environmental damage \n Replacement of \n products \n / \n services \n Reduced \n energy \n consumption Conformance to \n regulations \n These goals vary between improvements to products processes and services and dispel a popular myth that innovation deals mainly with new product development Most of the goals could apply to any organisation be it a manufacturing facility marketing firm hospital or local government Whether innovation goals are successfully achieved or otherwise depends greatly on the environment prevailing in the firm \n Conversely failure can develop in programs of innovations The causes of failure have been widely researched and can vary considerably Some causes will be external to the organization and outside its influence of control Others will be internal and ultimately within the control of the organization Internal causes of failure can be divided into causes associated with the cultural infrastructure and causes associated with the innovation process itself Common causes of failure within the innovation process in most organizations can be distilled into five types Poor goal definition Poor alignment of actions to goals Poor participation in teams Poor monitoring of results Poor communication and access to information \n Diffusion \n Diffusion of innovations \n Diffusion of innovation research was first started in by seminal researcher \n Gabriel Tarde \n who first plotted the S-shaped \n diffusion curve \n Tarde defined the innovation-decision process as a series of steps that includes \n First knowledge \n Forming an attitude \n A decision to adopt or reject \n Implementation and use \n Confirmation of the decision \n Once innovation occurs innovations may be spread from the innovator to other individuals and groups This process has been proposed that the life cycle of innovations can be described using the ' \n s-curve \n ' or \n diffusion curve \n The s-curve maps growth of revenue or productivity against time In the early stage of a particular innovation growth is relatively slow as the new product establishes itself At some point customers begin to demand and the product growth increases more rapidly New incremental innovations or changes to the product allow growth to continue Towards the end of its lifecycle growth slows and may even begin to decline In the later stages no amount of new investment in that product will yield a normal rate of return \n The s-curve derives from an assumption that new products are likely to have \"product life\" i e a start-up phase a rapid increase in revenue and eventual decline In fact the great majority of innovations never get off the bottom of the curve and never produce normal returns \n Innovative companies will typically be working on new innovations that will eventually replace older ones Successive s-curves will come along to replace older ones and continue to drive growth upwards In the figure above the first curve shows a current technology The second shows an \n emerging technology \n that currently yields lower growth but will eventually overtake current technology and lead to even greater levels of growth The length of life will depend on many factors \n Measures \n Edison et al \n in their review of literature on \n innovation management \n found innovation metrics They categorized these measures along five dimensions i e inputs to the innovation process output from the innovation process effect of the innovation output measures to access the activities in an innovation process and availability of factors that facilitate such a process \n There are two different types of measures for innovation the organizational level and the political level \n Organizational level \n The measure of innovation at the organizational level relates to individuals team-level assessments and private companies from the smallest to the largest company Measure of innovation for organizations can be conducted by surveys workshops consultants or internal benchmarking There is today no established general way to measure organizational innovation Corporate measurements are generally structured around \n balanced scorecards \n which cover several aspects of innovation such as business measures related to finances innovation process efficiency employees' contribution and motivation as well benefits for customers Measured values will vary widely between businesses covering for example new product revenue spending in R&D time to market customer and employee perception & satisfaction number of patents additional sales resulting from past innovations \n Political level \n For the political level measures of innovation are more focused on a country or region \n competitive advantage \n through innovation In this context organizational capabilities can be evaluated through various evaluation frameworks such as those of the European Foundation for Quality Management The \n OECD \n Oslo Manual suggests standard guidelines on measuring technological product and process innovation Some people consider the \n Oslo Manual \n complementary to the \n Frascati Manual \n from The new Oslo manual from takes a wider perspective to innovation and includes marketing and organizational innovation These standards are used for example in the European \n Community Innovation Surveys \n Other ways of measuring innovation have traditionally been expenditure for example investment in R&D Research and Development as percentage of GNP Gross National Product Whether this is a good measurement of innovation has been widely discussed and the Oslo Manual has incorporated some of the critique against earlier methods of measuring The traditional methods of measuring still inform many policy decisions The EU \n Lisbon Strategy \n has set as a goal that their average expenditure on R&D should be 3% of GDP \n Indicators \n Many scholars claim that there is a great bias towards the \"science and technology mode\" S&T-mode or STI-mode while the \"learning by doing using and interacting mode\" DUI-mode is ignored and measurements and research about it rarely done For example an institution may be high tech with the latest equipment but lacks crucial doing using and interacting tasks important for innovation \n citation needed \n A common industry view unsupported by empirical evidence is that comparative \n cost-effectiveness \n research is a form of \n price control \n which reduces returns to industry and thus limits R&D expenditure stifles future innovation and compromises new products access to markets \n Some academics claim cost-effectiveness research is a valuable value-based measure of innovation which accords \"truly significant\" therapeutic advances i e providing \"health gain\" higher prices than free market mechanisms \n Such \n value-based pricing \n has been viewed as a means of indicating to industry the type of innovation that should be rewarded from the public purse \n Research and Development Expenditure Credit \n An \n Australian \n academic developed the case that national comparative \n cost-effectiveness analysis \n systems should be viewed as measuring \"health innovation\" as an \n evidence-based policy \n concept for valuing innovation distinct from valuing through competitive markets a method which requires strong \n anti-trust \n laws to be effective on the basis that both methods of assessing \n pharmaceutical innovations \n are mentioned in annex 2C of the \n Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement \n yearneeded \n Indices \n Several indices attempt to measure innovation and rank entities based on

Jonathan Huebner \n a \n physicist \n working at the \n Pentagon \n 's \n Naval Air Warfare Center \n argued on the basis of both U S \n patents \n and world technological breakthroughs per capita that the rate of human technological innovation peaked in and has been slowing ever since \n In his article he asked \"Will the level of technology reach a maximum and then decline as in the Dark Ages?\" \n In later comments to \n New Scientist \n magazine Huebner clarified that while he believed that we will reach a rate of innovation in equivalent to that of the \n Dark Ages \n he was not predicting the reoccurrence of the Dark Ages themselves \n John Smart \n criticized the claim and asserted that \n technological singularity \n researcher \n Ray Kurzweil \n and others showed a \"clear trend of acceleration not deceleration\" when it came to innovations \n The foundation replied to Huebner the journal his article was published in citing \n Second Life \n and \n eHarmony \n as proof of accelerating innovation to which Huebner replied \n However Huebner's findings were confirmed in with \n U S Patent Office \n data \n and in a paper \n Innovation and international development \n The theme of innovation as a tool to disrupting patterns of poverty has gained momentum since the mid-2000s among major \n international development \n actors such as \n DFID \n Gates Foundation \n 's use of the \n Grand Challenge \n funding model \n and \n USAID \n 's Global Development Lab \n Networks have been established to support innovation in development such as D-Lab at \n MIT \n Investment funds have been established to identify and catalyze innovations in \n developing countries \n such as DFID's Global Innovation Fund \n Human Development Innovation Fund \n and in partnership with USAID the Global Development Innovation Ventures \n Government policies \n Given the noticeable effects on \n efficiency \n quality of life \n and \n productive growth \n innovation is a key factor in society and economy Consequently policymakers have long worked to develop environments that will foster innovation and its resulting positive benefits from funding \n Research and Development \n to supporting regulatory change funding the development of innovation clusters and using public purchasing and standardisation to 'pull' innovation through \n For instance experts are advocating that the U S federal government launch a National Infrastructure Foundation a nimble collaborative strategic intervention organization that will house innovations programs from fragmented silos under one entity inform federal officials on innovation \n performance metrics \n strengthen industry-university partnerships and support innovation \n economic development \n initiatives especially to strengthen \n regional clusters \n Because clusters are the geographic incubators of innovative products and processes a cluster development grant program would also be targeted for implementation By focusing on innovating in such areas as precision \n manufacturing \n information technology \n and \n clean energy \n other areas of national concern would be tackled including \n government debt \n carbon footprint \n and \n oil dependence \n The U S \n Economic Development Administration \n understand this reality in their continued Regional Innovation Clusters initiative \n In addition federal grants in R&D a crucial driver of innovation and productive growth should be expanded to levels similar to \n Japan \n Finland \n South Korea \n and \n Switzerland \n in order to stay globally competitive Also such grants should be better procured to \n metropolitan areas \n the essential engines of the American economy \n Many countries recognize the importance of research and development as well as innovation including Japan's \n Ministry of Education Culture Sports Science and Technology \n MEXT \n Germanys \n Federal Ministry of Education and Research \n and the \n

contemporary \n culture \n or \n subculture \n representing a technology-based extension of \n DIY culture \n citation needed \n that intersects with \n hacker culture \n which is less concerned with physical objects as it focuses on software and revels in the creation of new devices as well as \n tinkering \n with existing ones The maker culture in general supports \n open-source hardware \n Typical interests enjoyed by the maker culture include engineering-oriented pursuits such as \n electronics \n robotics \n 3-D printing \n and the use of \n Computer Numeric Control \n tools as well as more traditional activities such as \n metalworking \n woodworking \n and mainly its predecessor the traditional \n arts and crafts \n The subculture stresses a cut-and-paste approach to standardized hobbyist \n technologies \n and encourages cookbook re-use of designs published on websites and maker-oriented publications \n There is a strong focus on using and learning practical skills and applying them to reference designs \n Philosophical emphasis \n Makerspaces \n Maker segmentation \n Tools and hardware \n Other types of making \n Amateur scientific equipment \n Clothes \n Biology food and composting \n Organic cosmetics \n Music making \n Tool making \n Vehicles \n Media \n Maker faires \n Maker Film Fest \n Philosophical emphasis \n Maker culture emphasizes learning-through-doing \n active learning \n in a social environment Maker culture emphasizes informal networked peer-led and shared learning motivated by fun and self-fulfillment \n Maker culture encourages novel applications of technologies and the exploration of intersections between traditionally separate domains and ways of working including metal-working calligraphy film making and computer programming Community interaction and knowledge sharing are often mediated through networked technologies with websites and social media tools forming the basis of knowledge repositories and a central channel for information sharing and exchange of ideas and focused through social meetings in shared spaces such as hackspaces Maker culture has attracted the interest of educators concerned about students disengagement from STEM subjects science technology engineering and mathematics in formal educational settings Maker culture is seen as having the potential to contribute to a more participatory approach and create new pathways into topics that will make them more alive and relevant to learners \n Some say that the maker movement is a reaction to the de-valuing of physical exploration and the growing sense of disconnection with the physical world in modern cities \n Many products produced by the maker communities have a focus on \n health \n food \n sustainable development \n environmentalism \n and local \n culture \n and can from that point of view also be seen as a negative response to \n disposables \n globalised \n mass production \n the power of \n chain stores \n multinationals \n and \n consumerism \n In reaction to the rise of maker culture \n Barack Obama \n pledged to open several national \n research and development \n facilities to the public \n In addition the U S federal government renamed one of their national centers \" \n America Makes \n \" \n The maker movement is a social movement with an \n artisan \n spirit in which the methods of \n digital fabrication \n previously the exclusive domain of institutionshave become accessible at a personal scale following a logical and economic progression similar to the transition from minicomputers to personal computers in the \n microcomputer revolution \n of the 1970s \n In Dale Dougherty launched \n Make \n magazine to serve the growing community followed by the launch of \n Maker Faire \n The term coined by Dougherty grew into a full-fledged industry based on the growing number of DIYers who want to build something rather than buy it \n Spurred primarily by the advent of \n RepRap \n 3D printing \n for the fabrication of \n prototypes \n declining cost and broad adoption have opened up new realms of \n innovation \n As it has become cost effective to make just one item for prototyping or a small number of household items \n this approach can be depicted as personal fabrication for \"a market of one person\" \n Makerspaces \n Main articles \n Hackerspace \n and \n Fablab \n The rise of the maker culture is closely associated with the rise of hackerspaces Fab Labs and other \"maker spaces\" of which there are now many around the world including over each in Germany and the United States \n Hackerspaces allow like-minded individuals to share ideas tools and skillsets \n Some notable hackerspaces which have been linked with the maker culture include \n Urban Workshop \n Noisebridge \n NYC Resistor \n A2 Mech Shop \n Pumping Station One \n Artisan's Asylum \n danger!awesome \n and \n TechShop \n In addition those who identify with the subculture can be found at more traditional universities with a technical orientation such as \n MIT \n and \n Carnegie Mellon \n specifically around \" \n shop \n \" areas like the MIT Hobby Shop and CMU Robotics Club As maker culture becomes more popular hackerspaces and Fab Labs are becoming more common in universities \n and public libraries The federal government has started adopting the concept of fully open makerspaces within its agencies the first of which SpaceShop Rapid Prototyping Lab resides at \n NASA Ames Research Center \n In Europe the popularity of the labs is more prominent than in the US about three times more labs exist there \n Outside Europe and the US the maker culture is also on the rise with several hacker or makerspaces being landmarks in their respective cities' entrepreneurial and educational landscape More precisely \n HackerspaceSG \n in Singapore has been set up by the team now leading the city-state's and arguably South-East Asia's most prominent accelerator \n JFDI Asia \n Lamba Labs in Beirut is recognized as a hackerspace where people can collaborate freely in a city often divided by its different ethnic and religious groups \n Xinchejian \n in Shanghai is China's first hackerspace which allows for innovation and collaboration in a country known for its strong internet censorship \n With the rise of cities which will host 60% of mankind by \n citation needed \n hackerspaces fablabs and makerspaces will likely gain traction as they are places for local entrepreneurs to gather and collaborate providing local solutions to environmental social or economical issues \n The \n Institute for the Future \n has launched in this regard \n Maker Cities \n as \"an open and collaborative online game to generate ideas about how citizens are changing work production governance learning well-being and their neighborhoods and what this means for the future\" \n Cuba will host the first international Open Technology Life Workshop inviting American Makers to collaborate with Cuban Makers in January in Havana \n Over the same time frame \n makerspaces \n have started to spring up Though desktop machines and inexpensive tools for the home have made many projects possible some still require industrial equipment thats not accessible to the typical maker Makerspaces TechShop is probably the best-known with multiple locations around the U S tend to be a community-based industrial space that operate on a membership plan somewhat like a gym \n Maker segmentation \n As tools and technology became increasingly affordable and accessible and the business of making ecosystem more expansive and new makers started to learn basic skills such as soldering and working with Arduino and other easy-to-program development platforms makers began to segment into three distinct groups \n Dougherty identified them as zero-to-maker maker-to-maker and maker-to-market A fourth segment was recently added maker-enabler or maker-advocate \n Zero to maker \n Every maker has a different starting point However the common thread begins with an inspiration to invent the spark that turns an individual from purely consuming products to having a hand in actually making them To go from zero to maker the two most important aspects are the ability to learn the requisite skills and access to the necessary means of production \n Maker to maker \n The distinction in this stage is that makers begin to collaborate and access the expertise of others At this stage makers also contribute to existing platforms Powerful undercurrents are at work both from technological revolution as well as unleashing the innate desire for self-expression and creation The desire to improve and share with others catalyzes the move to maker to maker \n Maker to market \n From the workshops and the digital communities a new wave of invention and innovation springs forth Knowledge flows and concentrates Some of the inventions and creations will appeal to a broader audience than the original makers Some may even find commercial appeal However even if only a few makers pursue market opportunities the impact may be huge \n Maker advocate \n For every maker in the above segments there are individuals that foster and support them Children's museums and public libraries are promoting more DIY activities and tools to expose patrons to maker culture in the zero-to-maker segment Family members and maker space staff support the maker-to-maker segment Many maker businesses have a cloud of supporting personnel that enable their success Although not makers themselves these maker-advocates comprise a large segment of maker culture \n Tools and hardware \n Free hardware \n 3D printers \n and \n 3D scanners \n microcontrollers \n drones \n DIY electronics \n like \n littleBits \n and \n Makey Makey \n are just some of the tools that are helping grow the movement Theyre growing less expensive in some cases theyre already very reasonable and getting smaller But this combined with the cloud and the openness in hardware and software give the biggest advance to the maker culture \n The cloud itself is a basic tool in service of the maker movement enabling increased collaboration digital workflow distributed manufacturing i e the download of files that translate directly into objects via a digitized manufacturing process and \n collaborative economy \n This combined with the \n Open source \n movement initially focused on software has been expanding into \n open-source hardware \n assisted by easy access to online plans in the cloud and licensing agreements \n Programmable microcontrollers and microcomputers like the \n Arduino \n Raspberry Pi \n BeagleBone Black \n and Intels \n Galileo \n and \n Edison \n controllers are easy to program and enable connected devices and some open source Combined with the \n cloud \n theyre helping create the \n Internet of Things \n A very important tool for the Maker culture additive manufacturing like \n 3D printing \n including machining like CNC milling and routing has moved to the desktop This combines with the open hardware in the cloud for open-source 3D printing It also combines with DIY open-source microelectronics to create autoreplicant 3d printers such as \n RepRap \n Other types of making \n Maker culture involves many types of making - this section reviews some of the major types \n Amateur scientific equipment \n This involves making scientific instruments for \n citizen science \n or \n open source labs \n With the advent of low-cost digital manufacturing it is becoming increasingly common for scientists as well as amateurs to fabricate their own scientific apparatuses from open source hardware designs \n Clothes \n Ravelry \n Clothes can include sew and no-sew DIY hacks \n Clothing can also include knitted or crocheted clothing and accessories Some knitters may use knitting machines with varying degrees of automatic patterning Fully electronic knitting machines can be interfaced to computers running computer-aided design software Arduino boards have been interfaced to electronic knitting machines to further automate the process \n Free People \n a popular clothing retailer for young women often hosts craft nights inside the doors of its Anthropologie locations \n Biology food and composting \n Examples of maker culture in food production include \n baking \n homebrewing \n winemaking \n vegoil \n pickling \n sausage \n cheesemaking \n yogurt \n and \n pastry \n production \n This can also extend into \n urban agriculture \n composting \n and \n synthetic biology \n Organic cosmetics \n Organic movement \n Maker \n cosmetics \n includes \n perfumes \n creams \n lotions \n gels \n and \n

/ \n measuring spoons \n a \n dropper \n funnel \n and \n aluminum foil \n or \n wrapping paper \n if you are using clear glass bottles \n Music making \n The concept of homemade and experimental instruments in music has its roots prior to the maker movement from complicated experiments with figures such as \n Reed Ghazala \n and \n Michel Waisvisz \n pioneering early \n circuit bending \n techniques to simple projects such as the \n Cigar Box Guitar \n Bart Hopkin \n published the magazine \n Experimental Musical Instruments \n for years followed by a series of books about instrument building Organizations such as \n Zvex \n WORM \n STEIM \n Death by Audio \n and \n Casper Electronics \n cater to the do-it-yourself audience while musicians like \n Nicolas Collins \n and \n Yuri Landman \n create and perform with custom made and experimental instruments \n Tool making \n Makers can also make or fabricate their own tools \n This includes \n knives \n hand tools \n lathes \n 3-D printers \n wood working \n tools \n etc \n Vehicles \n A \n kit car \n also known as a \"component car\" is an automobile that is available as a set of parts that a manufacturer sells and the

\n Open machine design as compared to open-source software \n Open-design organizations \n Sources of the open-design movement \n Sharing of manufacturing information can be traced back to the 18th and 19th century \n Aggressive patenting put an end to that period of extensive knowledge sharing \n More recently principles of open design have been related to the \n free software \n and \n open source \n movements \n In \n Eric S Raymond \n Tim O'Reilly \n and \n Larry Augustin \n established \"open source\" as an alternative expression to \"free software \" and in \n Bruce Perens \n published \n the Open Source Definition \n In late Dr Sepehr Kiani a PhD in mechanical engineering from MIT realized that designers could benefit from open source policies and in early he convinced Dr Ryan Vallance and Dr Samir Nayfeh of the potential benefits of open design in machine design applications \n Together they established the \n Open Design Foundation \n ODF as a non-profit corporation and set out to develop an Open Design Definition \n The idea of open design was taken up either simultaneously or subsequently by several other groups and individuals The principles of open design are closely similar to those of \n open-source hardware \n design which emerged in March when Reinoud Lamberts of the \n Delft University of Technology \n proposed on his Open Design Circuits website the creation of a hardware design community in the spirit of free software \n Ronen Kadushin coined the title \"Open Design\" in his Masters thesis and the term was later formalized in the Open Design Manifesto \n Current directions of the open-design movement \n Play media \n Open Source Ecology \n open source farming and industrial machinery \n The open-design movement currently unites two trends On one hand people apply their skills and time on projects for the \n common good \n perhaps where funding or commercial interest is lacking for \n developing countries \n or to help spread ecological or cheaper technologies On the other hand open design may provide a framework for developing advanced projects and technologies that might be beyond the resource of any single company or country and involve people who without the \n copyleft \n mechanism might not collaborate otherwise There is now also a third trend where these two methods come together to use high-tech open-source e g 3D printing but customized local solutions for \n sustainable development \n Open machine design as compared to open-source software \n The open-design movement is currently fairly nascent but holds great potential for the future In some respects design and engineering are even more suited to open collaborative development than the increasingly common open-source software projects because with 3D models and photographs the concept can often be understood visually It is not even necessary that the project members speak the same languages to usefully collaborate \n However there are certain barriers to overcome for open design when compared to software development where there are mature and widely used tools available and the duplication and distribution of code cost next to nothing Creating testing and modifying physical designs is not quite so straightforward because of the effort time and cost required to create the physical artefact although with access to emerging flexible

spiritual \n vision They also share responsibilities and resources Intentional communities include \n cohousing \n residential \n land trusts \n ecovillages \n communes \n kibbutzim \n ashrams \n and \n housing cooperatives \n Typically new members of an intentional community are selected by the community's existing membership rather than by real-estate agents or land owners if the land is not

are scarcely different from the capitalist enterprises and regular towns to which the kibbutzim were originally supposed to be alternatives \n citation needed \n Indigenous Collaboration \n Collaboration in indigenous communities particularly in the Americas often includes the entire community working toward a common goal in a horizontal structure with flexible leadership \n Children in some Indigenous American communities work fluidly to collaborate with the rest of the community They are allowed and want to participate freely with the adults Children can be contributors in the process of meeting objectives by taking on tasks that suit their skills \n Indigenous learning techniques comprise \n Learning by Observing and Pitching In \n For example a study of Mayan fathers and children with traditional Indigenous ways of learning worked together in collaboration more frequently when building a 3D model puzzle then Mayan fathers with western schooling \n Also Chillihuani people of the Andes value work and form work parties in which members of each household in the community participate \n Children from indigenous-heritage communities want to help around the house voluntarily \n In the Mazahua Indigenous community of Mexico school children show initiative and autonomy by contributing in their classroom completing activities as a whole assisting and correcting their teacher during lectures when a mistake is made \n Fifth and sixth graders in the community work with the teacher installing a classroom window the installation becomes a class project in which the students participate in the process alongside the teacher They all work together without needing leadership and their movements are all in sync and flowing It is not a process of instruction but rather a hands-on experience in which students work together as a synchronous group with the teacher switching roles and sharing tasks In these communities collaboration is emphasized and learners are trusted to take initiative While one works the other watches intently and all are allowed to attempt tasks with the more experienced stepping in to complete more complex parts while others pay close attention \n Collaboration under capitalism \n Ayn Rand utterly rejected the notion that one should live an isolated life She recognized that a crucial way we develop ourselves and pursue our rational self-interest is by building strong relationships with other people whether in business friendship romance or any other kind of life-serving relationship Rand wrote hundreds of pages about the virtues and benefits of collaborating with others to mutual advantage She also recognized that as participants in capitalism were all connected through the voluntary division of labor in the free market where value is exchanged always for value In presenting her theory of rational egoism Rand explained why acting in ones self-interests often entails looking out for others to protect the innocent from injustice to aid our friends and allies and to protect and support our friends and loved ones \n Game theory \n This section \n does not \n cite \n any \n sources \n Please help \n improve this

\n As a discipline Project Management developed from different fields of application including construction engineering and defense In the United States the forefather of project management is \n Henry Gantt \n called the father of planning and control techniques who is famously known for his use of the \n \"bar\" chart \n as a project management tool for being an associate of \n Frederick Winslow Taylor \n 's theories of \n scientific management \n and for his study of the work and management of Navy ship building His work is the forerunner to many modern project management tools including the \n work breakdown structure \n WBS and resource allocation \n The 1950s marked the beginning of the modern project management era Again in the United States prior to the 1950s projects were managed on an ad hoc basis using mostly \n Gantt charts \n and informal techniques and tools At that time two mathematical project scheduling models were developed the \" \n Program Evaluation

Critical Path Method \n \" CPM developed in a joint venture by both \n DuPont Corporation \n and \n Remington Rand Corporation \n for managing plant maintenance projects These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises \n In the \n Project Management Institute \n PMI was formed to serve the interest of the project management industry The premise of PMI is that the tools and techniques of project management are common even among the widespread application of projects from the \n software industry \n to the construction industry In the PMI Board of Directors authorized the development of what has become \n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge \n PMBOK standards and guidelines of practice that are widely used throughout the profession The \n

Black Mountain was experimental by nature and committed to an \n interdisciplinary \n approach attracting a faculty which included many of America's leading visual artists poets and designers \n Operating in a relatively isolated rural location with little budget Black Mountain College inculcated an informal and collaborative spirit and over its lifetime attracted a venerable roster of instructors Some of the innovations relationships and unexpected connections formed at Black Mountain would prove to have a lasting influence on the postwar American art scene high culture and eventually \n pop culture \n Buckminster Fuller \n met student \n Kenneth Snelson \n at Black Mountain and the result was the first \n geodesic dome \n improvised out of slats in the school's back yard \n Merce Cunningham \n formed his dance company and \n John Cage \n staged his first \n happening \n Not a haphazardly conceived venture Black Mountain College was a consciously directed \n liberal arts \n school that grew out of the \n progressive education movement \n In its day it was a unique educational experiment for the artists and writers who conducted it and as such an important incubator for the American \n avant garde \n Black Mountain proved to be an important precursor to and prototype for many of the alternative colleges of today ranging from the \n University of California Santa Cruz \n to \n Hampshire College \n and \n Evergreen State College \n among others \n Learning Community \n The Evergreen signature clock tower \n Dr Wolff-Michael Roth and Stuart Lee of the \n University of Victoria \n assert \n that until the early 1990s the individual was the 'unit of instruction' and the focus of research The two observed that researchers and practitioners switched \n to the idea that knowing is 'better' thought of as a cultural practice \n Roth and Lee also claim \n that this led to changes in learning and teaching design in which students were encouraged to share their ways of doing mathematics history science with each other In other words that children take part in the construction of consensual domains and 'participate in the negotiation and institutionalisation of meaning' In effect they are participating in \n learning communities \n This analysis does not take account of the appearance of Learning communities in the United States in the early 1980s For example \n The Evergreen State College \n which is widely considered a pioneer in this area established an intercollegiate learning community in In this same college established The Washington Center for Improving the Quality of Undergraduate Education which focuses on collaborative education approaches including learning communities as one of its centerpieces \n Classical

genius artist has existed since the time of \n Giorgio Vasari \n s \n Lives of the Artists \n published in Vasari promulgated the idea that artistic skill was endowed upon chosen individuals by gods which created an enduring and largely false popular misunderstanding of many artistic processes Artists have used collaboration to complete large scale works for centuries but the myth of the lone

a venue lighting etc Hypothetically one person could control all of this But most often every work of ballet is the by product of collaboration From the earliest formal works of ballet to the great 19th century masterpieces of \n Pyotr Tchaikovsky \n and \n Marius Petipa \n to the 20th century masterworks of \n George Balanchine \n and \n Igor Stravinsky \n to todays ballet companies feature strong collaborative connections between choreographers composers and costume designers are essential Within dance as an art form there is also the collaboration between choreographer and dancer The choreographer creates a movement in her/his head and then physically demonstrates the movement to the dancer which the dancer sees and attempts to either mimic or interpret - two or more people striving for a connected goal \n Business \n Collaboration in business can be found both inter- and intra-organization \n and ranges from the simplicity of a \n partnership \n and \n crowd funding \n to the complexity of a \n multinational corporation \n Inter-organizational collaboration depicts relationship between two or several organizations in which the participating parties agree to invest resources mutually achieve goals share information resources rewards and responsibilities as well as jointly make decisions and solve problems \n Collaboration between public private and voluntary sectors can be effective in tackling complex policy problems but may be handled more effectively by committed \n boundary-spanning \n teams and \n networks \n than by formal organizational structures \n Collaboration between team members allows for better communication within the organization and throughout the supply chains It is a way of coordinating different ideas from numerous people to generate a wide variety of knowledge Collaboration with a selected few firms as opposed to collaboration with a large number of different firms has been shown to positively impact firm performance and innovation outcomes \n The recent improvement in technology has provided the world with high speed internet wireless connection and web-based collaboration tools like blogs and wikis and has as such created a \" \n mass collaboration \n \" People from all over the world are efficiently able to communicate and share ideas through the internet or even conferences without any geographical barriers The power of social networks is beginning to permeate into business culture where many collaborative uses are being found including \n file sharing \n and \n knowledge transfer \n Evan Rosen \n the author of \n The Culture of Collaboration \n defines collaboration as \"working together to create value while sharing virtual or physical space \" \n According to Rosen command-and-control organizational structures inhibit collaboration and replacing these obsolete structures allows collaboration to flourish \n Management cybernetics \n A plethora of studies have shown that collaboration can be a powerful tool towards higher achievement and increased productivity since collective efficacy can significantly boost groups aspirations motivational investment morale and resilience to challenges \n However a four-year study of interorganizational collaboration found that successful collaboration can be rapidly derailed through external policy steering particularly where it undermines relations built on trust \n On a more specific level \n coworking \n spaces are businesses dedicated to providing a space for freelancers to work with others in a collaborative

and content areas \n Once only regarded as collaboration between special education and general education teachers it is now more generally defined as two professionals delivering substantive instruction to a diverse group of students in a single physical space \" \n As classrooms have become increasingly diverse so too have the challenges for educators Due to the diverse needs of students with designated special needs English languages learners ELL and students of varied academic levels teachers have been led to develop new approaches that provide additional support for their students \n In practice this is an inclusive model where students are not removed from the classroom to receive separate instruction but rather they remain and receive collaborative instruction by both their general teacher and special education teachers \n Societal changes that have taken place over the past few decades allows new ways of conceptualizing collaboration and to understand the evolution and expansion of these types of relationships For example economic changes that have taken place domestically and internationally have resulted in the transformation from an industry-dependent economy to an information-centered economy that is dependent on new technologies and expansion of industries that provide services \n From an educational standpoint such transformations were projected through federal reports such as A Nation at Risk in and What Matters Most Teaching for Americas Future in In these reports economic success could be assured if students developed the capacity to learn how to manage teams andwork together successfully in teams \n The continuing development of Web technologies such as wikis blogs multiplayer games online communities and Twitter among others has changed the manner in which students communicate and collaborate Teachers are increasingly using \n collaborative software \n to establish \n virtual learning environments \n VLEs This allows them to share

\n due to the complexity of the technology Since the beginning all laboratories and electronic music studios have involved the presence of different individuals with diverse but intertwined competencies In particular the embedding of technological tools into the process of musical creation resulted in the emergence of a new agent with new expertise the musical assistant the technician the tutor the computer music designer the music mediator a profession that has been described and defined in different ways over the years who can work in the phase of writing creating new instruments recording and/or performance He or she explains the possibilities of the various instruments and applications as well as the potential sound effects to the composer when the latter did not have sufficient knowledge of the programme or a clear idea of what he or she could obtain from it The musical assistant also explains the most recent results in musical research and translates artistic ideas into programming languages Finally he or she transforms those ideas into a score or a computer program and often performs the musical piece during the concerts \n Examples of collaboration are

and staff collaboration at the organization level or with partners These include features such as staff networking expert recommendations information sharing expertise location \n peer feedback \n and real-time collaboration At the personal level this enables employees to enhance social awareness and their profiles and interactions Collaboration encompasses both asynchronous and synchronous methods of communication and serves as an umbrella term for a wide variety of software packages Perhaps the most commonly associated form of synchronous collaboration are web conferencing using tools but the term can easily be applied to IP telephony instant messaging and rich video interaction with telepresence as well \n The effectiveness of a collaborative effort is driven by three critical factors - Communication - Content Management - Workflow control \n The \n Internet \n The low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas knowledge and skills has made collaborative work dramatically easier Not only can a group cheaply communicate and test but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups to easily form in the first place even among niche interests An example of this is the \n free

\n Nazi German \n occupiers were suggesting for ideological reasons but was obviously not the case as one party was an army of occupation and the other were people of the occupied country living under the power of this army Thus the term \"collaboration\" acquired during \n World War II \n the additional sense of criminal deeds in the service of the occupying power including complicity with the occupying power in murder persecutions pillage and economic exploitation as well as participation in a \n puppet government \n The use of \"collaboration\" to mean \"traitorous cooperation with the

grade standards in quality complexity or functionality Prosumer also commonly refers \n to those products \n Semiprofessional \n \"Prosumer\" is a well-accepted category for camcorders digital cameras

section \n Producer and consumer \n Marshall McLuhan \n and Barrington Nevitt suggested in their book \n Take Today \n p that with electric technology the consumer would become a producer In the book \n The Third Wave \n futurologist \n Alvin Toffler \n coined the term \"prosumer\" when he predicted that the role of producers and \n consumers \n would begin to blur and merge even though he described it in his book \n Future Shock \n from Toffler envisioned a highly saturated \n marketplace \n as \n mass production \n of \n standardized \n products began to satisfy basic consumer demands To continue growing \n profit \n businesses would initiate a process of \n mass customization \n that is the mass production of highly customized products \n However to reach a high degree of customization consumers would have to take part in the production process especially in specifying \n design \n requirements In a sense this is merely an extension or broadening of the kind of relationship that many affluent clients have had with professionals like \n architects \n for many decades However in many cases architectural clients are not the only or even primary end-consumers a distinction touched upon in the \n H+ Magazine \n essay 'Prosumption Architecture The Decentralization of Architectural Agency as an Economic Imperative' \n Toffler has extended these and many other ideas well into the 21st-century Along with more recently published works such as \n Revolutionary Wealth \n we can recognize and assess both the concept and fact of the \n prosumer \n as it is seen and felt on a worldwide scale That these concepts are having global impact and reach however can be measured in part by noting in particular Toffler's popularity in \n China \n Discussing some of

critics of \n television \n recorded \n music and \n fast food \n would argue Indeed people are generally uninterested in going to the effort of customizing the myriad products that comprise modern consumer culture In \n The Paradox of Choice Why More is Less \n Barry Schwartz \n argues that \n diminishing returns \n from a \n confusing \n abundance of consumer choice is producing \n stress \n and dissatisfaction \n Still one key area of high-customization \n is \n taking place highly involved hobbyists \n In the digital and online world Prosumer is used to describe today's online buyers because not only are they consumers of products but they are able to produce their own products such as customised handbags jewellery with initials jumpers with team logos etc \n In the field of renewable energy prosumers are households or organisations which at times produce surplus fuel or energy and feed it into a national or local distribution network whilst at other times when their fuel or energy requirements outstrip their own production of it they consume that same fuel or energy from that grid This is widely done by households by means of PV panels on their roofs generating electricity It is also done by businesses which produce biogas and feed it into a gas network while using gas from the same network at other times or in other places The European Unions Nobel Grid project which is part of their Horizon research and innovation programme uses the term in this way for example \n Professional consumer \n With customization focused on \n leisure \n pursuits Toffler's initial combination has been largely supplanted by a second pair of blurring roles that of the \n professional \n and consumer In particular \n hobbyists \n have become ever-more demanding in the pursuits of their hobbies often rising above the level of dilettante an amateur someone who dabbles in a field out of casual interest rather than as a profession or serious interest to the point of commanding skills equal to that of professionals Key examples of such hobbies are \n home improvement \n as illustrated by the rise of \n hardware stores \n such as \n Home Depot \n cooking \n as illustrated by creation of entirely new \n cable television \n channels entirely dedicated to the culinary arts such as The Food Channel or \n Food Network \n photography \n as illustrated by still \n cameras \n and \n camcorders \n that often are on a par with equipment used by professionals \n This \n professional \n slant of the prosumer term is most common in photography which is a field that highlights prosumer \n trends \n Access to professional-level equipment and skills is made possible by combination of factors such as \n high \n disposable incomes \n by some sectors of the population \n increased leisure time again for some sectors of the population \n continuously falling prices \n of ever more advanced products especially electronics \n media geared towards amateurs and hobbyists \n beginning in the 1980s with the advent of \n desktop publishing \n a growing profusion of \n magazines \n to satisfy specialized interests \n beginning in the mid-1990s with the advent of the \n Internet \n an even wider range of \n websites \n with \n online forums \n to pool experience \n Pertaining to electronics are considered to be \"on the fence\" as a product of lower quality than a professional product and higher quality sometimes in the form of \n bells and whistles \n than a consumer product Some examples include \n Digital camcorders \n Still cameras \n HDTVs \n Tofflers Prosumption was well described and expanded in economic terms by Philip Kotler he saw Prosumer/Prosumption as a new challenge for marketers \n Philip Kotler anticipated that people will also want to play larger role in designing certain goods and services they consume furthermore modern computers will permit them to do it He also described several forces that would lead to more prosumption like activities and to more sustainable lifestyles that topic was further developed by Tomasz Szymusiak in and in two marketing books \n Non-corporate producer and consumer \n Part of \n

v \n t \n e \n Yet a third meaning or usage of prosumer is springing up especially among some \n activist \n groups That is the producer and consumer roles are being combined so as to \n exclude \n or at least diminish the role of the \n corporate \n producer thus rather than generating higher corporate profits from \n value-added \n products producers would at best be reduced to supplying lower-profit \n commodity \n inputs Indeed the more consumer-oriented prosumer spin is irrelevant to many people with diminished disposable income caused by various economic trends such as \n globalization \n automation \n and \n wealth concentration \n Prosumer from company perspective \n A fourth view of the Prosumer is from companies perspective who open up their processes and integrate end-users as prosumer for shared benefits Such motivated enthusiasts can be for instance integrated into a company's R&D Other benefits are strengthened relationship with the customer and faster feedback cycles Companies and individuals are increasingly utilizing and involving the \n end-users \n to develop final products and services In some instances end-users are creating products on their own without the interference or assistance of third parties i e companies organizations etc For example \n Lego Mindstorms \n allows users to download software from Lego's website so that the users can edit and update software as they wish \n Prosumption \n In their book \n Wikinomics How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything \n Don Tapscott \n and Anthony D Williams use the related term of prosumption production/consumption also coined by Toffler to refer to the creation of products and services by the same people who will ultimately use them The book states criteria that increase the value of prosumers' participation such as openness sharing peering globalizing But empirically some criteria have inverse relationships \n Impact and reception \n Adoption \n Identifiable trends and movements outside of the mainstream economy that have adopted prosumer terminology and techniques include \n a \n Do It Yourself \n DIY \n approach as a means of economic self-sufficiency or simply as a way to survive on diminished income \n the \n open source software \n movement creates software on their own prime example is the successful \n operating system \n Linux \n which now dominates the server domain \n Fablab \n movement self-fabrication capabilities especially \n 3d printing \n the \n voluntary simplicity \n movement that seeks personal social and environmental goals through prosumer activities such as \n growing one's own food \n repairing clothing and appliances rather than buying new items \n playing musical instruments rather than listening to recorded music \n use of

Concurrence \n market all prices are not equitable prices they are influenced by some violence on wants in the strength rate between demand and supply the difference between cost and price is the

can influence the R & D spending of a company in ways which directly benefit them For example say youre a manufacturer of widgets One of your customers changes their requirements and asks that all their widgets sing This customer is important enough that losing them would seriously hurt your bottom line Based on their request you direct a portion of your R & D budget to solve their specific

improvised or 'bodged' together a hastily improvised and poorly thought-out solution to a fault or 'bug' \n Although OED accepts Granholm's definition and credits him with the invention examples of its use before the 1960s exist \n A source of some confusion has been Granholm's jocular citation of the wholly fictitious lexicographer Phineas Burling of the firm \"Fink and Wiggles\" for \n Funk & Wagnalls \n as confirming the Germanic origin of the word \n A phone call to Phineas Burling can be revealing Phineas Burling is the Chief calligrapher with the Fink and Wiggles Publishing Company Inc Fink and Wiggles are of course the well known publishers of the NEW MULTILINGUAL DICTIONARY According to Burling the word \"kludge\" first appeared in the English language in the early fifteen-hundreds It was imported into the geographic region of the lowlands between King's Lynn then Bishop's Lynn and the Isle of Ely by Dutch settlers arriving there to reclaim tidelands of the Wash as rutabaga fields \n The word \"kludge\" is according to Burling derived from the same root as the German \"klug\" Dutch \n kloog \n Swedish \n Klag \n Danish \n Klog \n Gothic \n Klaugen \n Lettish \n Kladnis \n and Sanskrit \n Veklaunn \n originally meaning \"smart\" or \"witty\" In the typical machinations of language in evolutionary growth the word \"Kludge\" eventually came to mean \"not so smart\" or \"pretty ridiculous\" Today the leading definition given by the NEW MULTILINGUAL is \"An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts forming a distressing whole \" \n It is in this latter sense that \"Kludge\" is used by computer hardware men Today \"kludge\" forms one of the most beloved words in design terminology and it stands ready for handy application to the work of anyone who gins up 110-volt circuitry to plug into the VAC source The building of a Kludge however is not work for amateurs There is a certain indefinable masochistic finesse that must go into true Kludge building The professional can spot it instantly The amateur may readily presume that \"that's the way computers are\" \n Claims about derivation from the German adjective \"klug\" meaning clever are unlikely for the following reasons \n There is no equivalent usage in German \n Both pronunciations of the word contain the soft \"g\" which is not present in German \n The word emerges in English only in the 20th century \n Yiddish \n American Yiddish speakers use klug to mean too smart by half the reflected meaning of German klug/clever This may explain the idea of clever but clumsy and temporary as well as the pronunciation variation from German \n European surname \n It may instead derive from the mispronunciation of European surname Kluge be that German Dutch or Scandinavian Even if Burling's etymology were true it is doubtful that the American military or computer engineers who began using the term in the 20th century could have been aware of a term that had fallen from use in East Anglia sometime in the preceding years \n This \n OED2 \n entry also includes the verb kludge \"to improvise with a kludge or kludges\" and \n kludgemanship \n \"skill in designing or applying kludges\" \n Military jargon \n The \n Jargon File \n a k a \n The New Hacker's Dictionary \n which is a \n glossary \n of computer programmer slang maintained by \n Eric S Raymond \n differentiates \n kludge \n from \n kluge \n and cites usage examples predating \n kludge \n /kluhj/ n Incorrect though regrettably common spelling of \n kluge \n US These two words have been confused in American usage since the early 1960s and widely confounded in Great Britain since the end of World War II \n TMRC A \n crock \n that works A long-ago \n Datamation \n article by Jackson Granholme \n sic \n

around computers as far back as the mid-1950s and at that time used exclusively of hardware kluges\" The Jargon File gives possible etymologies from \n naval \n slang cf \n jury rig \n or printing equipment \n Kluge \n \"was common Navy slang in the \n World War II \n era for any piece of electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at sea\" A article in the \n New York Folklore Quarterly \n recorded the classic \n shaggy dog story \n \"'Murgatroyd the Kluge Maker' then current in the Armed Forces in which a 'kluge' was a complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function \" \n The term \n kluge \n as an overcomplicated or obscure contraption dates back at least to as evidenced by the article in the \n New York Folklore Quarterly \n but the term must have been in use long before that for the story to have any sense The following purports to be a summary of the original article that is somewhat more complete than the one quoted above \n On being drafted into the navy Murgatroyd gave his profession as \"kluge maker\" Not wanting to seem ignorant the clerk simply wrote this down Whenever Murgatroyd was asked what he was doing he said he was making a kluge and actually he was one of the world's best kluge makers Not wanting to seem ignorant his superiors kept giving him commendations and promotions until he reached the dizzy heights of commodore \n One day the admiral came to inspect the ship When Murgatroyd explained he was a kluge maker the admiral asked him what a kluge was the first person ever to do so Murgatroyd said it was hard to explain but he would make one so the admiral could see what it was After a couple of days he returned with a complex object \n \"Interesting \" said the admiral \"but what does it do?\" In reply Murgatroyd dropped it over the side of the ship As the thing sank it went \"kluge\" \n The Jargon File further includes \n kluge around \n \"to avoid a bug or difficult condition by inserting a kluge\" \n kluge up \n \"to lash together a quick hack to perform a task\" After Granholm's \"How to Design a Kludge\" article popularized the \n kluge \n variant \n kludge \n both were interchangeably used and confused The Jargon File concludes \n The result of this history is a tangle Many younger U S hackers pronounce the word as /klooj/ but spell it incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation as 'kludge' British hackers mostly learned /kluhj/ orally use it in a restricted negative sense and are at least consistent European hackers have mostly learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it /kluhj/ but use the wider American meaning! Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word's meaning \n Paper feeder \n Another hypothesis dates to \"when John Brandtjen convinced two young machinists from \n Oslo Norway \n named Abel and Eneval Kluge to service and install presses for his fledgling printing equipment firm\" In the brothers invented an automatic feeder for printing presses which by allowed Brandtjen and Kluge to move into a 3-story building in St Paul MN While the automatic feeder was a success unverified sources claim that it developed a reputation for being \"temperamental subject to frequent breakdowns and devilishly difficult to repair but oh so clever!\" The Kluge brothers continued to innovate and the company remained active as of Given that the feeder bore the Kluge name it seems reasonable that it became a byword for over-complex mechanical contraptions The Free Online Dictionary of Computing FOLDOC claims that the term kluge \"was used in connection with computers as far back as the mid-1950s and at that time was used exclusively for \n hardware \n kluges\" \n The fact that it was originally applied only to hardware again points back to the paper feeder as the origin FOLDOC goes on to say \" \n TMRC \n and the MIT hacker culture of the early 1960s seems to have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used some WWII military slang see also \n foobar \n It seems likely that 'kluge' came to MIT via alumni of the many military electronics projects run in Cambridge during the war many in MIT's venerable \n Building \n which housed TMRC until the building

proof the design and enable concurrent software development while the integrated components were developed and manufactured The term was in common enough use to appear in a fictional movie about the US space program \n Perhaps the ultimate kludge was the first \n US \n space station \n Skylab \n Its two major components the Saturn Workshop and the \n Apollo Telescope Mount \n began development as separate projects the SWS was kludged from the \n S-IVB \n stage of the \n Saturn 1B \n and \n Saturn V \n launch vehicles the ATM was kludged from an early design for the descent stage of the \n Apollo Lunar Module \n Later the SWS and ATM were folded into the \n Apollo Applications Program \n but the components were to have been launched separately then docked in orbit In the final design the SWS and ATM were launched together but for the single-launch concept to work the ATM had to pivot degrees on a truss structure from its launch position to its on-orbit orientation clearing the way for the crew to dock its \n Apollo Command/Service Module \n at the axial docking port of the Multiple Docking Adapter \n The Airlock Module's manufacturer \n McDonnell Douglas \n even recycled the hatch design from its \n Gemini spacecraft \n and kludged what was originally designed for the conical Gemini Command Module onto the cylindrical Skylab Airlock Module The Skylab project managed by the \n National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n 's \n Marshall Space Flight Center \n was seen by the Manned Spacecraft Center later \n Johnson Space Center \n as an invasion of its historical

It is somewhat similar in spirit to a \n workaround \n only without the grace A kludge is often used to change the behavior of a system after it is finished without having to make fundamental changes Sometimes the kludge is introduced in order to keep backwards compatibility but often it is simply introduced because the kludge is an easier alternative Note that a hack might be a kludge but that \n hack \n could be at least in computing ironic praise for a quick fix solution to a frustrating problem \n A kludge is often used to fix an unanticipated problem in an earlier kludge this is essentially a kind of \n cruft \n Something might be a kludge if it fails in \n corner cases \n but this is a less common sense as such situations are not expected to come up in typical usage More commonly a kludge is a poorly working \n heuristic \n which was expected to work adequately An intimate knowledge of the context i e problem domain and/or the kludge's execution environment is typically required to build a corner case kludge As a consequence they are sometimes ironically praised \n An anecdotal example of a kludge involved a computer part supposedly manufactured in the \n Soviet Union \n during the 1960s The part needed slightly delayed receipt of a signal to work Rather than setting up a timing system the kludge was to make the internal wires extra-long increasing the distance and thus increasing the time the electrical signal took to reach its destination \n citation needed \n A variation on this use of kludge is evasion of an unknown problem or bug in a \n computer program \n Rather than continue to struggle to find out exactly what is causing the bug and how to fix it the programmer may hack the problem by the simple kludge of writing new code which compensates For example if a variable keeps ending up doubled in a certain code area add code which divides by two when it is used after the original code has been executed \n In computer networking use of \n NAT \n Network Address Translation \n RFC \n or \n PAT \n Port Address Translation to cope with the shortage of \n IPv4 \n addresses is an example of a kludge \n In \n FidoNet \n terminology \n kludge \n refers to a piece of control data embedded inside a message \n Evolutionary neuroscience \n Evolutionary baggage \n The \n kludge \n or \n kluge \n metaphor has been adapted in fields

brain anatomy \n The transcendent aspects of our human experience the things that touch our emotional and cognitive core were not given to us by a Great Engineer These are not the latest design features of an impeccably crafted brain Rather at every turn brain design has been a kludge a workaround a jumble a pastiche The things we hold highest in our human experience love memory dreams and a predisposition for religious thought result from a particular agglomeration of ad hoc solutions that have been piled on through millions of years of evolution history It's not that we have fundamentally human thoughts and feelings \n despite \n the kludgy design of the brain as molded by the twists and turns of evolutionary history Rather we have them precisely \n because \n of that history \n The research psychologist \n Gary Marcus \n 's book \n Kluge The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind \n compares evolutionary kluges with engineering ones like \n manifold vacuum \n -powered \n windshield wipers \n when you accelerated or drove uphill \"Your wipers slowed to a crawl or even stopped working altogether \" \n For instance the vertebrate eye's \n retina \n that is

novel solutions to problems by making use of previously unrelated knowledge or ideas they already possess The term introduced by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks Matthew J Karlesky and Fiona Lee \n of the \n University of Michigan \n draws from two separate disciplines The first social bricolage was introduced by cultural anthropologist \n Claude Lvi-Strauss \n in Lvi-Strauss was interested in how societies create novel solutions by using resources that already exist in the collective social consciousness The second \"creative cognition is an intra-psychic approach to studying how individuals retrieve and recombine knowledge in new ways Psychological bricolage therefore refers to the cognitive processes that enable individuals to retrieve and recombine previously unrelated knowledge they already possess \n Psychological bricolage is an intra-individual process akin to \n Karl E Weick \n s notion of bricolage in organizations which is akin to Lvi-Strauss' notion of bricolage in societies \n Philosophy \n In his book \n The Savage Mind \n English translation French anthropologist \n Claude Lvi-Strauss \n used \"bricolage\" to describe the characteristic patterns of mythological thought In his description it is opposed to the engineers' creative thinking which proceeds from goals to means Mythical thought according to Lvi-Strauss attempts to re-use available materials in order to solve new problems \n Jacques Derrida \n extends this notion to any discourse \"If one calls \n bricolage \n the necessity of borrowing one's concept from the text of a heritage which is more or less coherent or ruined it must be said that every discourse is \n bricoleur \n \" \n Gilles Deleuze \n and \n Flix Guattari \n in their book \n Anti-Oedipus \n identify \n bricolage \n as the characteristic \n mode of production \n of the schizophrenic producer \n Education \n In the discussion of \n constructionism \n Seymour Papert \n discusses two styles of solving problems Contrary to the analytical style of solving problems he describes bricolage as a way to learn and solve problems by trying testing playing around \n Joe L Kincheloe \n has used the term bricolage in educational research to denote the use of multiperspectival research methods In Kincheloe's conception of the research bricolage diverse theoretical traditions are employed in a broader critical theoretical/critical pedagogical context to lay the foundation for a transformative mode of multimethodological inquiry Using these multiple frameworks and methodologies researchers are empowered to produce more rigorous and praxiological insights into socio-political and educational phenomena \n Kincheloe theorizes a critical multilogical epistemology and critical connected ontology to ground the research bricolage These philosophical notions provide the research bricolage with a sophisticated understanding of the complexity of knowledge production and the interrelated complexity of both researcher positionality and phenomena in the world Such complexity demands a more rigorous mode of research that is capable of dealing with the complications of socio-educational experience Such a critical form of rigor avoids the reductionism of many monological mimetic research orientations see Kincheloe Kincheloe & Berry \n Information technology \n Information systems \n In \n information systems \n bricolage is used by \n Claudio Ciborra \n to describe the way in which \n strategic information systems \n SIS can be built in order to maintain successful \n competitive advantage \n over a longer period of time than standard SIS By valuing tinkering and allowing SIS to evolve from the bottom-up rather than implementing it from the top-down the firm will end up with something that is deeply rooted in the \n organisational culture \n that is specific to that firm and is much less easily imitated \n Internet \n In her book \n Life on the Screen \n Sherry Turkle \n discusses the concept of bricolage as it applies to problem solving in code projects and workspace productivity She advocates the \"bricoleur style\" of programming as a valid and underexamined alternative to what she describes as the conventional structured \"planner\" approach In this style of coding the programmer works without an exhaustive preliminary specification opting instead for a step-by-step growth and re-evaluation process In her essay \"Epistemological Pluralism\" Turkle writes \"The bricoleur resembles the painter who stands back between brushstrokes looks at the canvas and only after this contemplation decides what to do next \" \n Visual Arts \n The visual arts is a field in which individuals often integrate a variety of knowledge sets in order to produce inventive work To reach this stage artists read print materials across a wide array of disciplines as well as information from their own social identities \n For instance the artist \n Shirin Neshat \n has integrated her identities as an Iranian exile and a woman in order to make complex creative and critical bodies of work \n This willingness to integrate diverse knowledge sets enables artists with multiple identities to fully leverage their knowledge sets This is demonstrated by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks Chi-Ying Chen and Fiona Lee who found that individuals were shown to exhibit greater levels of innovation in tasks related to their cultural identities when they successfully integrated those identities \n Business \n Karl Weick \n identifies the following requirements for successful bricolage in organizations \n Intimate knowledge of resources \n Careful observation and listening \n Trusting one's ideas \n Self-correcting structures with feedback \n In popular culture \n Fashion \n In his essay \"Subculture The Meaning of Style\" \n Dick Hebdige \n discusses how an individual can be identified as a bricoleur when they \"appropriated another range of commodities by placing them in a symbolic ensemble which served to erase or subvert their original straight meanings\" \n The fashion industry uses bricolage-like styles by incorporating items typically utilized for other purposes For example candy wrappers are woven together to produce a purse The movie \n Zoolander \n parodies this concept with \"Derelicte\" a line of clothing made from trash \n Television \n MacGyver \n is a television series in which the protagonist is the paragon of a bricoleur \n creating solutions for the problem to be solved out of immediately available found objects More recently Peter Hendry has continued the tradition of bricoleur in his weekly series \"What's Pete doing?\" \n The Wombles \n a children's program based on creatures living in Wimbledon Common is also a fine example of

used more in the sense of human sustainability on planet Earth and this has resulted in the most widely quoted definition of sustainability as a part of the concept \n sustainable development \n that of the \n Brundtland Commission \n of the \n United Nations \n on March sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs \n Components \n Three pillars of sustainability \n A \n diagram \n indicating the relationship between the \"three pillars of sustainability\" in which both \n economy \n and \n society \n are constrained by environmental limits \n Venn diagram \n of sustainable development \n at the confluence of three constituent parts \n The \n World Summit on Social Development \n identified sustainable development goals such as economic development social development and environmental protection \n This view has been expressed as an illustration using three overlapping ellipses indicating that the three pillars of sustainability are not mutually exclusive and can be mutually reinforcing \n In fact the three pillars are interdependent and in the long run none can exist without the others \n The three pillars have served as a common ground for numerous \n sustainability standards and certification \n systems in recent years in particular in the food industry \n Standards which today explicitly refer to the triple bottom line include \n Rainforest Alliance \n Fairtrade \n and \n UTZ Certified \n Some sustainability experts and practitioners have illustrated four pillars of sustainability or a quadruple bottom line One such pillar is future generations which emphasizes the long-term thinking associated with sustainability \n There is also an opinion that considers resource use and financial sustainability as two additional pillars of sustainability \n Sustainable development consists of balancing local and global efforts to meet basic human needs without destroying or degrading the natural environment \n The question then becomes how to represent the relationship between those needs and the environment \n A study from pointed out that \n environmental justice \n is as important as sustainable development \n Ecological economist \n Herman Daly \n asked \"what use is a sawmill without a forest?\" \n From this perspective the economy is a subsystem of human society which is itself a subsystem of the biosphere and a gain in one sector is a loss from another \n This perspective led to the nested circles figure of 'economics' inside 'society' inside the 'environment' \n The simple definition that sustainability is something that improves \"the \n quality of human life \n while living within the carrying capacity of supporting eco-systems\" \n though vague conveys the idea of sustainability having quantifiable limits But sustainability is also a call to action a task in progress or journey and therefore a political process so some definitions set out common goals and values \n The \n Earth Charter \n speaks of a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature universal human rights economic justice and a culture of peace This suggested a more complex figure of sustainability which included the importance of the domain of 'politics' \n More than that sustainability implies responsible and proactive decision-making and innovation that minimizes negative impact and maintains balance between ecological resilience economic prosperity political justice and cultural vibrancy to ensure a desirable planet for all species now and in the future \n Specific types of sustainability include \n sustainable agriculture \n sustainable architecture \n or \n ecological economics \n Understanding sustainable development is important but without clear targets an unfocused term like \"liberty\" or \"justice\" \n It has also been described as a \"dialogue of values that challenge the sociology of development\" \n Circles of sustainability \n Urban sustainability analysis of the greater urban area of the city of So Paulo using the Circles of Sustainability' method of the UN and Metropolis Association \n While the \n United Nations Millennium Declaration \n identified principles and treaties on sustainable development including economic development \n social development \n and environmental protection it continued using three domains economics environment and social sustainability More recently using a systematic domain model that responds to the debates over the last decade the \n Circles of Sustainability \n approach distinguished four domains of economic ecological political and cultural sustainability This in accord with the \n United Nations \n Agenda \n which specifies \n culture \n as the fourth domain of sustainable development \n The model is now being used by organizations such as the \n United Nations \n Cities Programme \n and Metropolis \n Seven modalities \n Another model suggests humans attempt to achieve all of their needs and aspirations via seven modalities economy community occupational groups government environment culture and physiology \n From the global to the individual human scale each of the seven modalities can be viewed across seven hierarchical levels Human sustainability can be achieved by attaining sustainability in all levels of the seven modalities \n Shaping the future \n Integral elements of sustainability are research and innovation activities A telling example is the \n European environmental research and innovation policy \n It aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to make them sustainable Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme \n Horizon \n which is also open to participation worldwide \n Encouraging good farming practices ensures farmers fully benefit from the environment and at the same time conserving it for future generations \n Resiliency \n Resiliency \n in ecology is the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbance and still retain its basic structure and viability Resilience-thinking evolved from the need to manage interactions between human-constructed systems and natural ecosystems in a sustainable way despite the fact that to \n policymakers \n a definition remains elusive Resilience-thinking addresses how much planetary ecological systems can withstand assault from human disturbances and still deliver the services current and future generations need from them It is also concerned with commitment from \n geopolitical \n policymakers to promote and manage essential planetary ecological resources in order to promote resilience and achieve sustainability of these essential resources for benefit of future generations of life? \n The resiliency of an ecosystem and thereby its sustainability can be reasonably measured at \n junctures \n or events where the combination of \n naturally \n occurring \n regenerative \n forces \n solar energy \n water soil \n atmosphere \n vegetation and \n biomass \n interact with the energy released into the ecosystem from disturbances \n A practical view of sustainability is \n closed systems \n that maintain processes of \n productivity \n indefinitely by replacing resources used by actions of people with resources of equal or greater value by those same people without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems \n In this way sustainability can be concretely measured in human projects if there is a transparent accounting of the resources put back into the ecosystem to replace those displaced In nature the accounting occurs naturally through a process of \n adaptation \n as an ecosystem returns to \n viability \n from an external disturbance The adaptation is a multi-stage process that begins with the disturbance event earthquake volcanic eruption hurricane tornado flood or thunderstorm followed by \n absorption \n utilization \n or \n deflection \n of the \n energy \n or energies that the external forces created \n In analysing systems such as urban and national parks dams farms and gardens theme parks open-pit mines water catchments one way to look at the relationship between sustainability and resiliency is to view the former with a long-term vision and resiliency as the capacity of human engineers to respond to immediate environmental events \n History of sustainability \n The history of sustainability traces human-dominated \n ecological \n systems from the earliest \n civilizations \n to the present time \n This history is characterized by the increased regional success of a particular \n society \n followed by crises that were either resolved producing sustainability or not leading to decline \n In early human history the use of fire and desire for specific foods may have altered the natural composition of plant and animal communities \n Between and years ago \n agrarian communities \n emerged which depended largely on their \n environment \n and the creation of a \"structure of permanence \" \n The Western \n industrial revolution \n of the 18th to 19th centuries tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in \n fossil fuels \n Coal \n was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity Modern \n sanitation \n systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease \n In the mid-20th century a gathering \n environmental movement \n pointed out that there were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed In the late 20th century environmental problems became global in scale \n The and \n energy crises \n demonstrated the extent to which the global community had become dependent on non-renewable energy resources \n In the 21st century there is increasing global awareness of the threat posed by the human \n greenhouse effect \n produced largely by forest clearing and the burning of fossil fuels \n Principles and concepts \n The philosophical and analytic framework of sustainability draws on and connects with many different disciplines and fields in recent years an area that has come to be called \n sustainability science \n has emerged \n Scale and context \n Sustainability is studied and managed over many scales levels or frames of reference of time and space and in many contexts of environmental social and economic organization The focus ranges from the total \n carrying capacity \n sustainability of planet Earth to the sustainability of economic sectors ecosystems countries municipalities neighbourhoods home gardens individual lives individual goods and services \n clarification needed \n occupations lifestyles behaviour patterns and so on In short it can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it \n As Daniel Botkin author and environmentalist has stated \"We see a landscape that is always in flux changing over many scales of time and space \" \n The sheer size and complexity of the planetary ecosystem has proved problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability To shed light on the big picture explorer and sustainability campaigner \n Jason Lewis \n has drawn parallels to other more tangible \n closed systems \n For example he likens human existence on Earth isolated as the planet is in space whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources cannot be imported to prevent \n accelerated depletion \n of resources to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water \n In both cases he argues exercising the \n precautionary principle \n is a key factor in survival \n Consumption \n A major driver of human impact on Earth systems is the destruction of \n biophysical \n resources \n and especially the Earth's ecosystems The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used whether or not those resources are renewable and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved Careful resource management can be applied at many scales from economic sectors like agriculture manufacturing and industry to work organizations the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services \n One of the initial attempts to express human impact mathematically was developed in the 1970s and is called the \n I PAT \n formula This formulation attempts to explain human consumption in terms of three components \n population \n numbers levels of consumption which it terms \"affluence\" although the usage is different and impact per unit of resource use which is termed \"technology\" because this impact depends on the \n technology \n used The equation is expressed \n I = P A T \n Where I = Environmental impact P = Population A = Affluence T = Technology \n Measurement \n Sustainability measurement \n Sustainability measurement is a term that denotes the measurements used as the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability \n The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability involving the sustainability of environmental social and economic domains both individually and in various combinations are evolving they include \n indicators \n benchmarks audits \n sustainability standards and certification \n systems like \n Fairtrade \n and \n Organic \n indexes and accounting as well as assessment appraisal \n and other reporting systems They are applied over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales \n Some of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate \n sustainability reporting \n Triple Bottom Line accounting \n World Sustainability Society \n Circles of Sustainability \n and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the \n Environmental Sustainability Index \n and \n Environmental Performance Index \n Population \n Human population control \n Graph showing human population growth from BC AD illustrating current exponential growth \n World population growth rate as estimated in by the U S Census Bureau International Data Base \n According to the most recent July revision of the official United Nations World Population Prospects the \n world population \n is projected to reach billion by up from the current billion July to exceed billion people by and to reach billion by the year \n Most of the increase will be in \n developing countries \n whose population is projected to rise from billion in to billion in This increase will be distributed among the population aged billion and or over billion because the number of children under age in developing countries is predicted to decrease In contrast the population of the more \n developed regions \n is expected to undergo only slight increase from billion to billion and this would have declined to billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries which is expected to average million persons annually from to \n Long-term estimates in of global population suggest a peak at around of nine to ten billion people and then a slow decrease to billion by \n Emerging economies like those of China and India aspire to the living standards of the Western world as does the non-industrialized world in general \n It is the combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that poses a stark challenge to sustainability \n Carrying capacity \n Further information \n Carrying capacity \n Ecological footprint for different nations compared to their Human Development Index HDI \n At the global scale scientific data now indicates that humans are living beyond the \n carrying capacity \n of planet Earth and that this cannot continue indefinitely This scientific evidence comes from many sources but is presented in detail in the \n Millennium Ecosystem Assessment \n and the \n planetary boundaries \n framework \n An early detailed examination of global limits was published in the book \n Limits to Growth \n which has prompted follow-up commentary and analysis \n A review in \n Nature \n by international researchers expressed concerns that the Earth may be \"approaching a state shift\" in its biosphere \n The \n Ecological footprint \n measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen In it required \n global hectares \n per person 30% more than the natural biological capacity of global hectares assuming no provision for other organisms \n The resulting \n ecological deficit \n must be met from unsustainable \n extra \n sources and these are obtained in three ways embedded in the goods and services of world trade taken from the past e g \n fossil fuels \n or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage e g by \n over exploiting \n forests \n and \n fisheries \n The figure right examines sustainability at the scale of individual countries by contrasting their Ecological Footprint with their UN \n Human Development Index \n a measure of standard of living The graph shows what is necessary for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while at the same time maintaining sustainable resource use The general trend is for higher standards of living to become less sustainable As always \n population growth \n has a marked influence on levels of consumption and the efficiency of resource use \n The sustainability goal is to raise the global standard of living without increasing the use of resources beyond globally sustainable levels that is to not exceed \"one planet\" consumption Information generated by reports at the national regional and city scales confirm the global trend towards societies that are becoming less sustainable over time \n Romanian American \n economist \n Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen \n a \n progenitor \n in \n economics \n and a \n paradigm founder \n of \n ecological economics \n has argued that the carrying capacity of Earth that is Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use \n Leading ecological economist and \n steady-state theorist \n Herman Daly \n a student of Georgescu-Roegen has \n propounded the same argument \n Global human impact on biodiversity \n Further information \n Millennium Ecosystem Assessment \n At a fundamental level \n energy flow \n and \n biogeochemical cycling \n set an upper limit on the number and mass of organisms in any ecosystem \n Human impacts on the Earth are demonstrated in a general way through detrimental changes in the global biogeochemical cycles of chemicals that are critical to life most notably those of \n water \n oxygen \n carbon \n nitrogen \n and \n phosphorus \n The \n Millennium Ecosystem Assessment \n is an international synthesis by over of the world's leading biological scientists that analyzes the state of the Earths \n ecosystems \n and provides summaries and guidelines for decision-makers It concludes that human activity is having a significant and escalating impact on the biodiversity of world \n ecosystems \n reducing both their \n resilience \n and \n biocapacity \n The report refers to natural systems as humanity's \"life-support system\" providing essential \" \n ecosystem services \n \" The assessment measures ecosystem services concluding that only four have shown improvement over the last years are in serious decline and five are in a precarious condition \n Sustainable development goals \n Sustainable development goals \n The \n Sustainable Development Goals \n SDGs are the current harmonized set of seventeen future international development targets \n The Official Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted on September has paragraphs with the main paragraph outlining the Sustainable Development Goals and its associated targets This included the following seventeen goals \n Poverty \n End poverty in all its forms everywhere \n Food \n End hunger \n achieve \n food security \n and improved nutrition and promote \n sustainable agriculture \n Health \n Ensure healthy lives and promote \n well-being \n for all at all ages \n Education \n Ensure \n inclusive \n and \n equitable \n quality education and promote \n lifelong learning \n opportunities for all \n Women \n Achieve \n gender equality \n and \n empower \n all women and girls \n Water \n Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all \n Energy \n Ensure access to affordable reliable sustainable and modern energy for all \n Economy \n Promote sustained inclusive and sustainable

access to justice \n for all and build effective accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels \n Sustainability \n Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for \n sustainable development \n As of August there were proposed targets for these goals and proposed indicators to show compliance \n The \n Sustainable Development Goals \n SDGs replace the eight \n Millennium Development Goals \n MDGs which expired at the end of The MDGs were established in following the \n Millennium Summit \n of the \n United Nations \n Adopted by the \n United Nations member states \n at the time and more than twenty \n international organizations \n these goals were advanced to help achieve the following \n sustainable development \n standards by \n To eradicate \n extreme poverty and hunger \n To achieve \n universal primary education \n To promote \n gender equality \n and empower women \n To reduce \n child mortality \n To improve \n maternal health \n To combat \n HIV/AIDS \n malaria \n and other diseases \n To ensure environmental sustainability one of the targets in this goal focuses on increasing sustainable access to safe \n drinking water \n and basic \n sanitation \n To develop a global partnership for development \n Sustainable development \n According to the data that member countries represented to the \n United Nations \n Cuba \n was the only nation in the world in that met the \n World Wide Fund for Nature \n 's definition of \n sustainable development \n with an \n ecological footprint \n of less than hectares per capita and a \n Human Development Index \n of over \n Environmental dimension \n Healthy ecosystems provide vital goods and services to humans and other organisms There are two major ways of reducing negative human impact and enhancing \n ecosystem services \n and the first of these is \n environmental management \n This direct approach is based largely on information gained from \n earth science \n environmental science \n and \n conservation biology \n However this is management at the end of a long series of indirect causal factors that are initiated by human \n consumption \n so a second approach is through demand management of human resource use \n Management of human consumption of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from \n economics \n Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability renewable resources should provide a \n sustainable yield \n the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment \n Environmental management \n Sustainability and environmental management \n At the global scale and in the broadest sense environmental management involves the \n oceans \n freshwater \n systems land and \n atmosphere \n but following the sustainability principle of scale it can be equally applied to any ecosystem from a tropical rainforest to a home garden \n Atmosphere \n At a March meeting of the \n Copenhagen Climate Council \n climate experts from countries issued a keynote statement that there is now \"no excuse\" for failing to act on global warming and that without strong carbon reduction \"abrupt or irreversible\" shifts in climate may occur that \"will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with\" \n Management of the global atmosphere now involves assessment of all aspects of the \n carbon cycle \n to identify opportunities to address human-induced \n climate change \n and this has become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential catastrophic effects on biodiversity and human communities see \n Energy \n below \n Other human impacts on the atmosphere include the \n air pollution \n in cities the \n pollutants \n including toxic chemicals like \n nitrogen oxides \n sulfur oxides \n volatile organic compounds \n and \n airborne particulate matter \n that produce \n photochemical smog \n and \n acid rain \n and the \n chlorofluorocarbons \n that degrade the \n ozone layer \n Anthropogenic \n particulates such as sulfate \n aerosols \n in the atmosphere reduce the direct \n irradiance \n and reflectance \n albedo \n of the \n Earth \n 's surface Known as \n global dimming \n the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between and although the trend has subsequently reversed Global dimming may have disturbed the global \n water cycle \n by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of \n greenhouse gases \n on \n global warming \n Freshwater and oceans \n Changes in environmental conditions lead to \n coral bleaching \n and harm to biodiversity of fragile marine ecosystems \n Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface Of this 5% is the salty water of the \n oceans \n and only 5% freshwater most of which is locked up in the \n Antarctic ice sheet \n The remaining freshwater is found in glaciers lakes rivers wetlands the soil aquifers and atmosphere Due to the water cycle fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation however there is still a limited amount necessitating management of this resource Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for \n ecosystem services \n has only recently emerged as during the 20th century more than half the worlds \n wetlands \n have been lost along with their valuable environmental services Increasing \n urbanization \n pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean safe water \n Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue harvestable and green soil water available for plant use water and this applies at all scales of water management \n Ocean \n circulation patterns have a strong influence on \n climate \n and \n weather \n and in turn the food supply of both humans and other organisms Scientists have warned of the possibility under the influence of climate change of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of \n ocean currents \n that could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe \n Ten per cent of the world's population about million people live in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise \n Land use \n A rice paddy in Bangladesh Rice wheat corn and potatoes make up more than half the world's food supply \n Loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development forestry and agriculture as \n natural capital \n is progressively converted to man-made capital Land use change is fundamental to the operations of the \n biosphere \n because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to \n urbanisation \n agriculture \n forest \n woodland \n grassland \n and \n pasture \n have a marked effect on the global water carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems \n At the local human scale major sustainability benefits accrue from \n sustainable parks and gardens \n and \n green cities \n Since the \n Neolithic Revolution \n about 47% of the worlds forests have been lost to human use Present-day forests occupy about a quarter of the worlds ice-free land with about half of these occurring in the tropics \n In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing with the exception of Siberia but \n deforestation \n in the tropics is of major concern \n Food \n is essential to life Feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earths resources This begins with the appropriation of about 38% of the Earths land surface \n and about 20% of its net primary productivity \n Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness everything from the crop need for irrigation water synthetic \n fertilizers \n and \n pesticides \n to the resource costs of food packaging transport now a major part of global trade and retail Environmental problems associated with \n industrial agriculture \n and \n agribusiness \n are now being addressed through such movements as sustainable agriculture \n organic farming \n and more sustainable business practices \n Management of human consumption \n Further information \n Consumption economics \n Helix of sustainability the \n carbon cycle \n of manufacturing \n The underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption \n This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production use and disposal more sustainable Consumption of goods and services can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns through to the resource demands of specific goods and services the impacts of economic sectors through national economies to the global economy \n Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation The ideas of embodied resource use the total resources needed to produce a product or service \n resource intensity \n and \n resource productivity \n are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption Key resource categories relating to human needs are \n food \n energy \n materials and water \n In the \n International Resource Panel \n hosted by the \n United Nations Environment Programme \n UNEP published the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production \n and identified priority actions for developed and developing countries The study found that the most critical impacts are related to \n ecosystem \n health human health and \n resource depletion \n From a production perspective it found that fossil-fuel combustion processes agriculture and \n fisheries \n have the most important impacts Meanwhile from a final \n consumption \n perspective it found that household consumption related to mobility shelter \n food \n and energy-using products cause the majority of \n life-cycle \n impacts of consumption \n Energy \n Main articles \n Sustainable energy \n Renewable energy \n and \n Efficient energy use \n Flow of CO \n in an \n ecosystem \n The Sun's energy stored by plants \n primary producers \n during \n photosynthesis \n passes through the \n food chain \n to other organisms to ultimately power all living processes Since the \n industrial revolution \n the concentrated energy of the \n Sun \n stored in fossilized plants as \n fossil fuels \n has been a major driver of \n technology \n which in turn has been the source of both economic and political power In climate scientists of the \n IPCC \n concluded that there was at least a 90% probability that atmospheric increase in CO \n was human-induced mostly as a result of fossil fuel emissions but to a lesser extent from changes in land use Stabilizing the worlds climate will require high-income countries to reduce their emissions by 6090% over levels by which should hold CO \n levels at 450650ppm from current levels of about 380ppm Above this level temperatures could rise by more than 2C to produce catastrophic \n climate change \n Reduction of current CO \n levels must be achieved against a background of global population increase and developing countries aspiring to energy-intensive high consumption Western lifestyles \n Reducing greenhouse emissions is being tackled at all scales ranging from tracking the passage of carbon through the \n carbon cycle \n to the \n commercialization of renewable energy \n developing less carbon-hungry technology and transport systems and attempts by individuals to lead \n carbon neutral \n lifestyles by monitoring the fossil fuel use embodied in all the goods and services they use \n Engineering \n of \n emerging technologies \n such as \n carbon-neutral fuel \n and energy storage systems such as \n power to gas \n compressed air energy storage \n and \n pumped-storage hydroelectricity \n are necessary to store power from transient \n renewable energy \n sources including emerging renewables such as \n airborne wind turbines \n Water \n Further information \n Water resources \n Water security \n and \n food security \n are inextricably linked In the decade human water withdrawals were four times greater than the previous decade This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the \n economy \n especially the increase in irrigated land growth in industrial and power sectors and intensive \n dam \n construction on all continents This altered the water cycle of \n rivers \n and \n lakes \n affected their \n water quality \n and had a significant impact on the global water cycle \n Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers this percentage is likely to increase if \n climate change \n impacts become more severe \n populations \n increase aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary \n From to water demand doubled agricultural use increased by 75% industrial use by more than 200% and domestic use more than 400% \n In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 4050% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture 22% for \n industry \n and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing \n Water efficiency is being improved on a global scale by increased \n demand management \n improved infrastructure improved water \n productivity \n of agriculture minimising the water intensity embodied water of goods and services addressing shortages in the non-industrialized world concentrating food production in areas of high productivity and planning for \n climate change \n such as through flexible system design A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible \n At the local level people are becoming more self-sufficient by harvesting rainwater and reducing use of mains water \n Food \n Feijoada A typical black bean food dish from \n Brazil \n Further information \n Food \n Food security \n and \n Category Sustainable food system \n The \n American Public Health Association \n APHA defines a \"sustainable food system\" \n as \"one that provides healthy food to meet current food needs while maintaining healthy ecosystems that can also provide food for generations to come with minimal negative impact to the environment A sustainable food system also encourages local production and distribution infrastructures and makes nutritious food available accessible and affordable to all Further it is humane and just protecting farmers and other workers consumers and communities \" \n Concerns about the environmental impacts of agribusiness and the stark contrast between the \n obesity \n problems of the Western world and the poverty and food insecurity of the developing world have generated a strong movement towards healthy sustainable eating as a major component of overall \n ethical consumerism \n The environmental effects of different dietary patterns depend on many factors including the proportion of animal and plant foods consumed and the method of food production \n The \n World Health Organization \n has published a \n Global Strategy on Diet Physical Activity and Health \n report which was endorsed by the May \n World Health Assembly \n It recommends the Mediterranean diet which is associated with health and \n longevity \n and is low in \n meat \n rich in \n fruits \n and \n vegetables \n low in added sugar and limited salt and low in \n saturated fatty \n acids the traditional source of \n fat \n in the Mediterranean is \n olive oil \n rich in \n monounsaturated fat \n The healthy rice-based Japanese diet is also high in \n carbohydrates \n and low in fat Both diets are low in meat and \n saturated fats \n and high in \n legumes \n and other vegetables they are associated with a low incidence of ailments and low environmental impact \n At the global level the environmental impact of agribusiness is being addressed through \n sustainable agriculture \n and \n organic farming \n At the local level there are various movements working towards local food production more productive use of urban wastelands and domestic gardens including \n permaculture \n urban horticulture \n local food \n slow food \n sustainable gardening \n and \n organic gardening \n Sustainable seafood \n is seafood from either fished or farmed sources that can maintain or increase production in the future without jeopardizing the ecosystems from which it was acquired The sustainable seafood movement has gained momentum as more people become aware about both \n overfishing \n and environmentally destructive fishing methods \n Materials toxic substances waste \n An electric wire reel reused as a center table in a \n Rio de Janeiro \n decoration \n fair \n The reuse of materials is a sustainable practice that is rapidly growing among \n designers \n in \n Brazil \n As global population and affluence has increased so has the use of various materials increased in volume diversity and distance transported Included here are raw materials minerals synthetic chemicals including \n hazardous substances \n manufactured products food living organisms and waste \n By humanity could consume an estimated billion tons of minerals ores fossil fuels and biomass per year three times its current amount unless the economic growth rate is decoupled from the rate of natural \n resource consumption \n Developed countries' citizens consume an average of tons of those four key resources per capita ranging up to or more tons per person in some developed countries with resource consumption levels far beyond what is likely sustainable \n Sustainable use of materials has targeted the idea of \n dematerialization \n converting the linear path of materials extraction use disposal in landfill to a \n circular material flow \n that reuses materials as much as possible much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature \n This approach is supported by \n product stewardship \n and the increasing use of \n material flow analysis \n at all levels especially individual countries and the global economy \n The use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources and that can be recycled is preferred to the use on non-renewables from a life cycle standpoint \n The \n waste hierarchy \n Synthetic chemical \n production has escalated following the stimulus it received during the second World War Chemical production includes everything from herbicides pesticides and fertilizers to domestic chemicals and hazardous substances \n Apart from the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere chemicals of particular concern include \n heavy metals \n nuclear waste \n chlorofluorocarbons \n persistent organic pollutants \n and all harmful chemicals capable of \n bioaccumulation \n Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless there needs to be rigorous testing of new chemicals in all countries for adverse environmental and health effects International legislation has been established to deal with the global distribution and management of \n dangerous goods \n The effects of some chemical agents needed long-term measurements and a lot of legal battles to realize their danger to human health The classification of the toxic carcinogenic agents is handle by the \n International Agency for Research on Cancer \n Every economic activity produces material that can be classified as waste To reduce waste industry business and government are now mimicking nature by turning the waste produced by \n industrial metabolism \n into resource Dematerialization is being encouraged through the ideas of \n industrial ecology \n ecodesign \n and \n ecolabelling \n In addition to the well-established reduce reuse and recycle shoppers are using their purchasing power for \n ethical consumerism \n The European Union is expected to table by the end of an ambitious Circular Economy package which is expected to include concrete legislative proposals on waste management \n ecodesign \n and limits on land fills \n Economic dimension \n Further information \n Ecological economics \n Environmental economics \n and \n Green economy \n The \n Great Fish Market \n painted by \n Jan Brueghel the Elder \n On one account sustainability \"concerns the specification of a set of actions to be taken by present persons that will not diminish the prospects of future persons to enjoy levels of consumption wealth utility or welfare comparable to those enjoyed by present persons \" \n Sustainability interfaces with economics through the social and ecological consequences of economic activity \n Sustainability economics represents \" a broad interpretation of ecological economics where environmental and ecological variables and issues are basic but part of a multidimensional perspective Social cultural health-related and monetary/financial aspects have to be integrated into the analysis \" \n However the concept of sustainability is much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare resources or profit margins \n At present the average per capita consumption of people in the developing world is sustainable but population numbers are increasing and individuals are aspiring to high-consumption Western lifestyles The developed world population is only increasing slightly but consumption levels are unsustainable The challenge for sustainability is to curb and manage Western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact This must be done by using strategies and technology that break the link between on the one hand economic growth and on the other \n environmental damage \n and resource depletion \n A recent UNEP report proposes a \n green economy \n defined as one that improves human well-being and social equity while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities it \"does not favor one political perspective over another but works to minimize excessive depletion of \n natural capital \n \" The report makes three key findings that greening not only generates increases in wealth in particular a gain in ecological commons or natural capital but also over a period of six years produces a higher rate of GDP growth that there is an inextricable link between poverty eradication and better maintenance and conservation of the ecological commons arising from the benefit flows from natural capital that are received directly by the poor \"in the transition to a green economy new jobs are created which in time exceed the losses in brown economy jobs However there is a period of job losses in transition which requires investment in re-skilling and re-educating the workforce \n Several key areas have been targeted for economic analysis and reform the environmental effects of unconstrained economic growth the consequences of nature being treated as an economic \n externality \n and the possibility of an economics that takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior

demonstrated on graphs of human population numbers economic growth and environmental indicators \n Unsustainable economic growth has been starkly compared to the malignant growth of a cancer \n because it eats away at the Earth's \n ecosystem services \n which are its life-support system There is concern that unless resource use is checked modern global civilization will follow the path of ancient civilizations that collapsed through \n overexploitation \n of their resource base \n While conventional economics is concerned largely with economic growth and the efficient allocation of resources ecological economics has the explicit goal of sustainable scale rather than continual growth \n fair distribution \n and efficient allocation in that order \n The \n World Business Council for Sustainable Development \n states that \"business cannot succeed in societies that fail\" \n In \n economic \n and \n environmental \n fields the term \n decoupling \n is becoming increasingly used in the context of economic production and environmental quality When used in this way it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to \n environmental quality \n An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled Exactly how if or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate In the \n International Resource Panel \n hosted by the \n United Nations Environment Programme \n UNEP warned that by the human race could be devouring billion tons of minerals ores fossil fuels and biomass per year three times its current rate of consumption unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling \n The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of tons of those four key resources per capita per annum ranging up to or more tons per person in some developed countries By comparison the average person in India today consumes four tons per year Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce \n resource intensity \n the amount of resource e g water energy or materials needed for the production consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service whether this be achieved from improved economic management product design or new technology \n There are conflicting views whether improvements in technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation On the one hand it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity i e energy and materials use per unit \n GDP \n could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution \n On the other hand an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth in large part because of the \n rebound effect conservation \n or \n Jevons Paradox \n resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution \n Furthermore there are inherent thermodynamic i e \n second law of thermodynamics \n and practical limits to all efficiency improvements For example there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food and there are limits to making automobiles houses furniture and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions \n Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution i e economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run Consequently long-term sustainability requires the transition to a \n steady state economy \n in which total GDP remains more or less constant as has been advocated for decades by \n Herman Daly \n and others in the \n ecological economics \n community \n A different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the \n restore \n approach \n This approach views \"restore\" as a fourth component to the common reduce reuse recycle motto Participants in such efforts are encouraged to voluntarily donate towards nature conservation a small fraction of the financial savings they experience through a more frugal use of resources These financial savings would normally lead to rebound effects but a theoretical analysis suggests that donating even a small fraction of the experienced savings can potentially more than eliminate rebound effects \n Nature as an economic externality \n Deforestation \n of native \n rain forest \n in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of \n clay \n for \n civil engineering \n picture \n Further information \n Ecosystem services \n The economic importance of nature is indicated by the use of the expression \n ecosystem services \n to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free \n In general as a \n commodity \n or service becomes more scarce the \n price \n increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality technical innovation and alternative products However this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system \n As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic \n externalities \n they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded a situation sometimes referred to as the \n Tragedy of the Commons \n One approach to this dilemma has been the attempt to \"internalize\" these \"externalities\" by using market strategies like \n ecotaxes \n and incentives tradeable permits for carbon and the encouragement of \n payment for ecosystem services \n Community currencies \n associated with \n Local Exchange Trading Systems \n LETS a \n gift economy \n and \n Time Banking \n have also been promoted as a way of supporting local economies and the environment \n Green economics \n is another market-based attempt to address issues of equity and the environment \n The global recession and a range of associated government policies are likely to bring the biggest annual fall in the world's carbon dioxide emissions in years \n Economic opportunity \n Treating the environment as an externality may generate short-term profit at the expense of sustainability \n Sustainable business \n practices on the other hand integrate ecological concerns with social and economic ones i e the \n triple bottom line \n Growth that depletes ecosystem services is sometimes termed \" \n uneconomic growth \n \" as it leads to a decline in \n quality of life \n Minimizing such growth can provide opportunities for local businesses For example industrial waste can be treated as an \"economic resource in the wrong place\" The benefits of \n waste reduction \n include savings from disposal costs fewer environmental penalties and reduced liability insurance This may lead to increased market share due to an improved public image \n Energy efficiency can also increase profits by reducing costs \n The idea of sustainability as a business opportunity has led to the formation of organizations such as the Sustainability Consortium of the \n Society for Organizational Learning \n the Sustainable Business Institute and the World Council for Sustainable Development \n The expansion of sustainable business opportunities can contribute to \n job creation \n through the introduction of \n green-collar \n workers \n Research focusing on progressive corporate leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has yielded a leadership competency model for sustainability \n and led to emergence of the concept of \"embedded sustainability\" defined by its authors Chris Laszlo and \n Nadya Zhexembayeva \n as \"incorporation of environmental health and social value into the core business with no trade-off in price or quality in other words with no social or green premium \" \n Laszlo and Zhexembayeva's research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value creation a better risk-management b increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use c better product differentiation d new market entrances e enhanced brand and reputation f greater opportunity to influence industry standards and g greater opportunity for radical innovation \n Nadya Zhexembayeva \n 's research further suggested that innovation driven by resource depletion can result in fundamental advantages for company products and services as well as the company strategy as a whole when right principles of innovation are applied \n Ecosocialist approach \n Further information \n Eco-socialism \n and \n Marxism \n One school of thought often labeled \n ecosocialism \n or ecological Marxism asserts that the \n capitalist economic system \n is fundamentally incompatible with the ecological and social requirements of sustainability \n This theory rests on the premises that \n Capitalisms sole economic purpose is unlimited \n capital accumulation \n in the hands of the \n capitalist class \n The urge to accumulate the \n profit motive \n drives capitalists to continually reinvest and expand production creating indefinite and unsustainable economic growth \n Capital tends to degrade the conditions of its own production the ecosystems and resources on which any economy depends \n Thus according to this analysis \n Giving economic priority to the fulfillment of \n human needs \n while staying within ecological limits as \n sustainable development \n demands is in conflict with the structural workings of capitalism \n A steady-state capitalist economy is impossible \n further a steady-state capitalist economy is socially undesirable due to the inevitable outcome of massive \n unemployment and underemployment \n Capitalism will unless overcome by \n revolution \n run up against the physical limits of the biosphere and \n self-destruct \n By this logic market-based solutions to ecological crises \n ecological economics \n environmental economics \n green economy \n are rejected as technical tweaks that do not confront capitalisms structural failures \n Low-risk technology/science-based solutions such as \n solar power \n sustainable agriculture \n and increases in \n energy efficiency \n are seen as necessary but insufficient \n High-risk technological solutions such as \n nuclear power \n and \n climate engineering \n are entirely rejected \n Attempts made by businesses to \n greenwash \n their practices are regarded as false advertising and it is pointed out that implementation of renewable technology such as \n Walmart \n s proposition to supply their electricity with solar power has \n the effect opposite of reductions in resource consumption \n viz further economic growth \n Sustainable business \n models and the \n triple bottom line \n are viewed as morally praiseworthy but ignorant to the tendency in capitalism for the \n distribution of wealth \n to become increasingly unequal and socially unstable/unsustainable \n Ecosocialists claim that the general unwillingness of capitalists to tolerateand capitalist governments to implementconstraints on maximum profit such as ecotaxes or preservation and conservation measures renders \n environmental reforms \n incapable of facilitating large-scale change History teaches us that although capitalism has at times responded to environmental movements at a certain point at which the systems underlying accumulation drive is affected its resistance to environmental demands stiffens \n They also note that up until the event of total \n ecological collapse \n destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation thus capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters i e convert to sustainable/ecological production \n Ecosocialists advocate for the \n revolutionary \n succession of capitalism by ecosocialisman \n egalitarian \n economic/political/social structure designed to harmonize human society with non-human ecology and to fulfill \n human needs \n as the only sufficient solution to the present-day ecological crisis and hence the only path towards sustainability \n Sustainability is viewed not as a domain exclusive to scientists environmental activists and business leaders but as a holistic project that must involve the whole of humanity redefining its place in \n Nature \n What every environmentalist needs to know is that capitalism is not the solution but the problem and that if humanity is going to survive this crisis it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom through social struggle in order to create a whole new worldin coevolution with the planet \n Social dimension \n Further information \n Social sustainability \n Environmental policy \n Sustainability issues are generally expressed in \n scientific \n and environmental terms as well as in ethical terms of \n stewardship \n but implementing change is a social challenge that entails among other things \n international \n and national \n law \n urban planning \n and transport local and individual \n lifestyles \n and \n ethical consumerism \n \"The relationship between human rights and human development corporate power and environmental justice global poverty and citizen action suggest that responsible global citizenship is an inescapable element of what may at first glance seem to be simply matters of personal consumer and moral choice \" \n Peace security social justice \n Further information \n Peace \n Social justice \n Environmental justice \n and \n Environmental ethics \n Social disruptions like \n war \n crime \n and \n corruption \n divert resources from areas of greatest human need damage the capacity of societies to plan for the future and generally threaten human well-being and the environment \n Broad-based strategies for more sustainable social systems include improved education and the political empowerment of women especially in developing countries greater regard for social justice notably equity between rich and poor both within and between countries and intergenerational equity \n Depletion of natural resources including fresh water \n increases the likelihood of resource wars \n This aspect of sustainability has been referred to as \n environmental security \n and creates a clear need for \n global environmental agreements \n to manage resources such as aquifers and rivers which span political boundaries and to protect shared global systems including \n oceans \n and the \n atmosphere \n Poverty \n Further information \n Poverty \n A major hurdle to achieve sustainability is the alleviation of poverty It has been widely acknowledged that poverty is one source of environmental degradation Such acknowledgment has been made by the \n Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future \n and the Millennium Development Goals \n There is a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions that it is impossible to separate economic development issues from environment issues according to the Brundtland report poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality \n Individuals living in poverty tend to rely heavily on their local ecosystem as a source for basic needs such as nutrition and medicine and general well-being \n As population growth continues to increase increasing pressure is being placed on the local ecosystem to provide these basic essentials According to the UN Population Fund high fertility and poverty have been strongly correlated and the worlds poorest countries also have the highest fertility and population growth rates \n The word sustainability is also used widely by western country development agencies and international charities to focus their poverty alleviation efforts in ways that can be sustained by the local populace and its environment For example teaching \n water treatment \n to the poor by boiling their water with \n charcoal \n would not generally be considered a sustainable strategy whereas using \n PET \n solar water disinfection \n would be Also sustainable \n best practices \n can involve the \n recycling \n of materials such as the use of \n recycled \n plastics \n for lumber where deforestation has devastated a country's timber base Another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries such as \n Bridges to Prosperity \n 's use of wire rope from shipping container \n gantry cranes \n to act as the structural wire rope for \n footbridges \n that cross rivers in poor rural areas in Asia and Africa \n Human relationship to nature \n Further information \n Environmental studies \n According to \n Murray Bookchin \n the idea that humans must dominate nature is common in \n hierarchical \n societies Bookchin contends that \n capitalism \n and \n market \n relationships if unchecked have the capacity to reduce the planet to a mere resource to be exploited Nature is thus treated as a \n commodity \n The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital \n Social ecology \n founded by Bookchin is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity's present ecological problems originate in indeed are mere symptoms of dysfunctional social arrangements Whereas most authors proceed as if our ecological problems can be fixed by implementing recommendations which stem from physical biological economic etc studies Bookchin's claim is that these problems can only be resolved by understanding the underlying social processes and intervening in those processes by applying the concepts and methods of the social sciences \n A pure capitalist approach has also been criticized in \n Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change \n to \n mitigation \n the \n effects of global warming \n in this excerpt \n the greatest example of \n market failure \n we have ever seen \n Deep ecology \n is a movement founded by \n Arne Naess \n that establishes principles for the well-being of all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms The movement advocates among other things a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world To achieve this deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic technological and ideological structures that will improve the \n quality of life \n rather than the \n standard of living \n Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen \n The concept of a billion-year \n Sustainocene \n has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species for example through \n artificial photosynthesis \n allowing \n Rights of Nature \n Human settlements \n Sustainability principles \n Reduce dependence upon fossil fuels \n underground metals and minerals \n Reduce dependence upon synthetic chemicals \n and other unnatural substances \n Reduce encroachment upon nature \n Meet human needs fairly & efficiently \n One approach to \n sustainable living \n exemplified by small-scale urban \n transition towns \n and rural \n ecovillages \n seeks to create self-reliant communities based on principles of \n simple living \n which maximize \n self-sufficiency \n particularly in food production These principles on a broader scale underpin the concept of a \n bioregional \n economy \n These approaches often utilize commons based knowledge sharing of \n open source appropriate technology \n Other approaches loosely based around \n New Urbanism \n are successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve \n sustainable cities \n which support \n sustainable transport \n Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures compared with those living in \n sprawling \n suburbs \n In \n sustainable architecture \n the recent movement of \n New Classical Architecture \n promotes a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops \n smart growth \n architectural tradition \n and \n classical design \n This in contrast to \n modernist \n and \n globally uniform \n architecture as well as opposing solitary \n housing estates \n and \n suburban sprawl \n Both trends started in the 1980s The concept of \n Circular flow land use management \n has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl \n Large scale \n social movements \n can influence both community choices and the built environment \n Eco-municipalities \n may be one such movement \n Eco-municipalities take a \n systems \n approach based on sustainability principles The eco-municipality movement is participatory involving community members in a bottom-up approach In Sweden more than cities and towns25 per cent of all municipalities in the countryhave adopted a common set of \n \"Sustainability Principles\" \n and implemented these systematically throughout their municipal operations There are now twelve eco-municipalities in the United States and the \n American Planning Association \n has adopted sustainability objectives based on the same principles \n There is a wealth of advice available to individuals wishing to reduce their personal and social impact on the environment through small inexpensive and easily achievable steps \n But the transition required to reduce global human consumption to within sustainable limits involves much larger changes at all levels and contexts of society \n The \n United Nations \n has recognised the central role of education and have declared a \n decade of education for sustainable development \n which aims to \"challenge us all to adopt new behaviours and practices to secure our future\" \n The \n Worldwide Fund for Nature \n proposes a strategy for sustainability that goes beyond education to tackle underlying individualistic and materialistic \n societal values \n head-on and strengthen people's connections with the natural world \n Human and labor rights \n Application of \n social sustainability \n requires stakeholders to look at human and labor rights prevention of human trafficking and other human rights risks \n These issues should be considered in production and procurement of various worldwide commodities The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services \n The \n Equator Principles \n financial industry \n Fair Wear Foundation \n garments and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level such as \n Green Seal \n for cleaning products \n NSF \n -140 for carpet production and even labeling of \n Organic food \n in the United States \n Cultural dimension \n The cultural dimension of sustainability is known as \n culture \n the Agenda for culture and vice versa At least since with e g the start of UCLG and the first Culture Summit of UCLG in Bilbao - to March culture is seen as a pillar for Sustainable Development \"The organizing principle for sustainability is sustainable development which includes the four interconnected domains ecology economics politics and culture \" The model is now being used by organizations such as the United Nations Cities Programme and Metropolis Culture is anchored in the \n Sustainable Development Goals \n more particularly in SDG Goal Make cities and human settlements inclusive safe resilient and sustainable Chapter strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the worlds cultural and natural heritage\" More SDG Goal Make cities and human settlements inclusive safe resilient and sustainable \n More \n Tourism \n Sustainability is central to underpinning feelings of authenticity in tourism \n Experiences can be enhanced when substituting the contrived for the genuine and at the same time inspire a potentially deleterious appetite for follow-up visits to the real thing objectively authentic sites untouched by repair or rejuvenation Feelings of authenticity at a tourist site are thus implicitly linked to sustainable tourism as the maximisation of existential felt authenticity at sites of limited historical provenance

manufacturing information can be traced back to the 18th and 19th century \n Aggressive patenting put an end to that period of extensive knowledge sharing \n More recently principles of open design have been related to the \n free software \n and \n open source \n movements \n In \n Eric S Raymond \n Tim O'Reilly \n and \n Larry Augustin \n established \"open source\" as an alternative expression to \"free software \" and in \n Bruce Perens \n published \n the Open Source Definition \n In late Dr Sepehr Kiani a PhD in mechanical engineering from MIT realized that designers could benefit from open source policies and in early he convinced Dr Ryan Vallance and Dr Samir Nayfeh of the potential benefits of open design in machine design applications \n Together they established the \n Open Design Foundation \n ODF as a non-profit corporation and set out to develop an Open Design Definition \n The idea of open design was taken up either simultaneously or subsequently by several other groups and individuals The principles of open design are closely similar to those of \n open-source hardware \n design which emerged in March when Reinoud Lamberts of the \n Delft University of Technology \n proposed on his Open Design Circuits website the creation of a hardware design community in the spirit of free software \n Ronen Kadushin coined the title \"Open Design\" in his Masters thesis and the term was later formalized in the Open Design Manifesto \n Current directions of the open-design movement \n Play media \n Open Source Ecology \n open source farming and industrial machinery \n The open-design movement currently unites two trends On one hand people apply their skills and time on projects for the \n common good \n perhaps where funding or commercial interest is lacking for \n developing countries \n or to help spread ecological or cheaper technologies On the other hand open design may provide a framework for developing advanced projects and technologies that might be beyond the resource of any single company or country and involve people who without the \n copyleft \n mechanism might not collaborate otherwise There is now also a third trend where these two methods come together to use high-tech open-source e g 3D printing but customized local solutions for \n sustainable development \n Open machine design as compared to open-source software \n The open-design movement is currently fairly nascent but holds great potential for the future In some respects design and engineering are even more suited to open collaborative development than the increasingly common open-source software projects because with 3D models and photographs the concept can often be understood visually It is not even necessary that the project members speak the same languages to usefully collaborate \n However there are certain barriers to overcome for open design when compared to software development where there are mature and widely used tools available and the duplication and distribution of code cost next to nothing Creating testing and modifying physical designs is not quite so straightforward because of the effort time and cost required to create the physical artefact although with access to emerging flexible computer-controlled manufacturing techniques the complexity and effort of construction can be significantly reduced see tools mentioned in the \n fab lab \n article \n Open-design organizations \n VIA OpenBook \n reference design \n CAD \n visualisation \n Open design is currently a fledgling movement consisting of several

\n social centers \n adult education \n centers public schools public libraries or on \n university campuses \n but may relocate to industrial or warehouse space when they need more room \n Hackerspaces with open membership became common throughout Germany in the 1990s in the orbit of the German \n Chaos Computer Club \n CCC with the \n c-base \n being probably an example The concept however was limited to less than a dozen spaces within Germany and did not spread beyond borders at first Most likely this was because initial founding costs were prohibitive for small groups without the support of a large organization like the CCC \n In \n Paul Bohm \n came up with a fundraising strategy based on the \n Street Performer Protocol \n to build \n Metalab \n in Vienna Austria and became its founding director In he and others started Hackerspaces org a wiki-based website that maintains a list of many hackerspaces and documents patterns on how to start and run them As of September the community list included hackerspaces with active sites and planned sites \n The advent of \n crowdfunding \n and \n Kickstarter \n has put the tools required to build hackerspaces within reach of an even wider audience Those tools are for example used by \n Bilal Ghalib \n who had previously worked on a hackerspace documentary and others to bring the hackerspace concept to the Middle East \n Most recent studies of hackerspace in China where Internet access is heavily censored suggest that new businesses and organized tech conferences there serve to intervene in the status quo \"from within\" The first hackerspace in China \n Xinchejian \n opened in Shanghai in Thereafter a network of hackerspaces emerged nourishing an emerging maker culture By designing open technologies and developing new businesses Chinese makers make use of the system make fun of it altering it and provoking it DIY makers often bring and align contradictory ideas together such as copycat and open source manufacturing and DIY individual empowerment and collective change In doing so they craft a subject position beyond the common rhetoric that Chinese citizens lack creativity As a site of individual empowerment hackerspace and DIY making enable people to remake the very societal norms and material infrastructures that undergird their work and livelihood \n Facilities \n An artist gives a tour of one of the two machine shops in Xanadu a makerspace under the \n aegis \n of \n Burning Man \n Idaho Burners Alliance in \n Boise \n which is open to all \n Makerspace layout \n The specific tools and resources available at hackerspaces vary from place to place They typically provide space for members to work on their individual projects or to collaborate on group projects with other members Hackerspaces may also operate computer tool lending libraries \n or physical tool lending libraries \n The building or facility the hackerspace occupies provides physical infrastructure that members need to complete their projects In addition to space most hackerspaces provide \n electrical power \n computer servers \n and \n networking \n with \n Internet \n connectivity Well-equipped hackerspaces may provide \n machine tools \n sewing \n crafting \n art fabrication \n audio equipment \n video projectors \n game consoles \n electronic instrumentation such as \n oscilloscopes \n and \n signal generators \n electronic components and raw materials for hacking and various other tools for electronics fabrication and creating things \n Specialized \n large-format printers \n 3D

and may teach courses in basic or advanced cooking \n Organization \n Billboard \n promoting makerspaces \n The individual character of a hackerspace is determined by its members Many hackerspaces are governed by elected boards selected by active members in good standing Elected officers may serve predetermined terms and help direct decisionmaking with regards to purchasing new equipment recruiting new members formulating policy conforming to safety requirements and other administrative issues \n Membership fees \n are usually the main income of a hackerspace but some also accept \n external sponsors \n Some hackerspaces in the US have \n c \n status or the equivalent in their jurisdiction while others have chosen to forgo tax exempt status \n University-affiliated hackerspaces often do not charge an explicit fee but are generally limited to students staff or alumni although visiting guests from other hackerspaces are usually welcome Some hackerspaces accept volunteer labor in lieu of membership fees especially from financially limited participants In addition some hackerspaces earn income from sponsoring and staffing high-tech \n flea markets \n where members of the general public may buy and sell new and used equipment and supplies \n There is a loose informal tradition at many hackerspaces of welcoming visitors from other similar organizations whether across town or internationally Free exchange of ideas skills and knowledge are encouraged especially at periodic gatherings sometimes called \"build nights\" or \"open house\" days \n Hackerspaces and makerspaces are increasingly being included as \n learning spaces \n in schools \n learning commons \n and other educational facilities \n Ethic \n Hackerspaces are widely defined on hackerspaces org as community-operated physical places where people can meet and work on their projects The exact functioning of the space varies from place to place and is determined by its members and while there is no blueprint or set of guidelines to create a hackerspace they generally follow a hacker ethic \n which include freedom in the sense of autonomy as well as of free access and circulation of information distrust of authority that is opposing the traditional industrial top-down style of organization embracing the concept of learning by doing and peer-to-peer learning processes as opposed to formal modes of learning sharing solidarity and cooperation \n Difficulties \n Hackerspaces can run into difficulties with \n building codes \n or other planning regulations which may not be designed to handle their scope of activities For example a new hackerspace in \n Nashua New Hampshire \n was shut down by the city after an inspection in The main issues involved ventilation of heat and toxic fumes the space was reopened after improvements were made to the building \n The difficulties with opening hackerspaces and makerspaces within \n non-profit organizations \n such as schools and \n public libraries \n include cost space liability and availability of personnel \n Many hackerspaces struggle to attract diverse users One national study showed makerspace users were 81% male \n Although many women participate in some form of making 41% have backgrounds that are in the realms of arts crafts and design which are not taken as seriously in \n maker culture \n Because makerspaces are most often dominated by male makers 65% of whom have physical science or engineering backgrounds women with more creative backgrounds tend to feel unwelcome Makers with less technical backgrounds employ a different style of working taking time to sketch and think To more technically proficient makers this is seen as a weakness and not just a different style of working \n Notable hackerspaces \n A directory is maintained at the hackerspaces org \n wiki For some other notable examples see \n Category Hackerspace \n Over the years many hackerspaces have grown significantly in membership operational budgets and local media attention Many have also helped establish other hackerspaces in nearby locations \n c-base \n from \n Berlin \n is recognized as one of the first independent

For the album by Rik Emmett see \n Handiwork album \n A handyman working on a door frame \n A \n handyman \n also known as a \n handyperson \n or \n handyworker \n is a person skilled at a wide range of repairs typically around the home These tasks include trade skills repair work \n maintenance \n work are both interior and exterior and are sometimes described as \"side work\" \"odd jobs\" or \"fix-up tasks\" Specifically these jobs could be light \n plumbing \n jobs such as fixing a leaky toilet or light \n electric \n jobs such as changing a light fixture \n Handyman projects \n Handyman businesses \n Market estimates \n Independent operators \n Franchise businesses \n Assessment of handyman options \n Legal issues \n Handymen in popular culture \n List of handyman jobs \n Handyman projects \n One handyman project was to repair shaky stairs a wooden structure was built inside to prevent collapse \n The term \n handyman \n increasingly describes a paid worker but it also includes non-paid homeowners or \n do-it-yourselfers \n Tasks range from minor to major from unskilled to highly skilled and include painting \n drywall \n repair remodeling minor plumbing work minor electrical work household carpentry sheetrock crown moulding and furniture assembly see more complete list below The term \n handyman \n is occasionally applied as an adjective to describe politicians or business leaders who make substantial organizational changes such as overhauling a business structure or administrative division \n A handyman built this mailbox from particle board with hinges and exterior paint the rounded edges were made with a sander \n Many people can do common household repairs There are resources on the Internet as well as \n do-it-yourself \n guide books \n with instructions about how to complete a wide range of projects Sometimes the fix-it skill is seen as genetic and people lacking such skills are said to \"lack the handy-man gene \" \n One trend is that fewer homeowners are inclined to do fix-up jobs perhaps because of time constraints perhaps because of lack of interest one reporter commented \"my family's fix-it gene petered out before it reached my generation \" \n A primary rule for all do-it-yourself repair work is \n focus entirely on one thing at a time \n For example focus on getting a nail then focus on hammering the nail but don't try to do both tasks simultaneously In this manner injuries and mistakes are avoided \n This project involved mortaring the crack between the back patio and the exterior wall to prevent water from seeping into the basement \n Generally the job of paid handyman is low status a semi-skilled labor job It's a less prestigious occupation than a specialist such as a plumber electrician or carpenter With the emergence of large national chains an effort is being made to change that perception by emphasizing professionalism and the fact that a handyman is actually a technician with multiple skills and a wide range of knowledge At the same time unpaid homeowners skilled at repairs are valued for saving money And handyman tools sometimes become useful in different places for example when a proper \n neurological drill \n was not available an \n Australian \n doctor used a handyman's drill in to open a hole in the head of a 13-year-old boy to relieve pressure after a \n brain injury \n the boy's life was saved \n Installing kitchen cabinets is a medium-level handyman job with multiple steps \n Handyman businesses \n Market estimates \n An estimate was that in the market for home-maintenance and repair spending was up 14% from to \n Another estimate was that the market in the United States was $126 billion and was increasing by about 4% annually \n American homes are aging one estimate was that in more than half of all homes are older than years \n And as populations worldwide tend to become older on average and since increasingly elderly people will be less inclined and able to maintain their homes it is likely that demand for handyman services will grow \n Independent operators \n Many towns have handymen who work part-time for friends or family or neighbors who are skilled in a variety of tasks Sometimes they advertise in newspapers or online They vary in quality professionalism skill level and price Contractors often criticize the work of previous contractors and this practice is not limited to handymen but to all trades \n Handymen have advertised their services through flyers and mailings in addition free websites such as \n Craigslist \n and \n SkillSlate \n help customers and handymen find each other \n This entire porch was rebuilt by a handyman including the substructure columns railings 1x1s and moldings and door surrounds replacing a porch is a difficult project for amateurs \n Franchise businesses \n In there were national handyman service firms which handle such nationwide tasks as \n public relations \n marketing \n advertising \n and \n signage \n but sell specific territories to franchise owners A franchise contract typically gives a franchise owner the exclusive right to take service calls within a given geographical area The websites of these firms put possible customers in touch with local owners which have handymen and trucks Customers call the local numbers Typically these firms charge around $100/hour although fees vary by locality and time of year In many parts of the world there are professional handyman firms that do small home or commercial projects which claim possible advantages such as having workers who are insured and licensed Their branch offices schedule service appointments for full-time and part-time handymen to visit and make repairs and sometimes coordinate with sub-contractors \n One \n Lehman Brothers \n executive after being let go from the \n Wall Street \n firm bought a Union New Jersey franchise from a national handyman firm \n A franchise was approximately $110 with a franchise fee of $14 according to a spokesperson for a national handyman franchise \n A handyman built this bathroom wall using two-by-four boards after electricians added the wires metal plates were put on studs to prevent nails and screws to hold drywall from going into electric wires a handyman added the drywall \n Some see a benefit of franchising as \"entrepreneurship under the safety net of a tried-and-true business umbrella\" \n but forecast a percent decrease in franchise businesses during the 2008-2009 recession \n In according to a survey released by the Washington-based International Franchise Association showed franchised establishments in the United States employing some million people \n Franchises offer training \n advertising \n and \n information technology \n support lower procurement costs and access to a network of established operators \n Franchise handyman firms sometimes pitch clients by asking prospective customers about their unresolved \"to-do lists \" \n The firm does odd jobs \n carpentry \n and \n repairs \n Trends such as a \"poverty of time\" and a \"glut of unhandy husbands\" has spurred the business \n Technicians do a range of services including tile work painting and wallpapering \n One firm charges $88 per hour \n The firm targets a work category which full-fledged remodelers and contractors find unprofitable \n A consumer was quoted by a reporter explaining the decision to hire one firm \"'I couldn't find anyone to come in and help me because the jobs were too small' said Meg Beck of Huntington who needed some painting and carpentry done She turned to one franchise firm and said she liked the fact that the service has well-marked trucks and uniformed technicians and that a dispatcher called with the names of the crew before they showed up \" \n There are indications that these businesses are growing \n There are different firms operating \n Other competitors include online referral services \n In addition some large home centers offer installation services for products such as cabinets and carpet installation \n Sometimes homeowners contact a professional service after trying but failing to do repair work themselves in one instance a \n Minneapolis \n homeowner attempted a project but called a technician to finish the project and the overall cost was substantial \n Assessment of handyman options \n Handymen have been hired to de-clutter \n basements \n and build movable \n shelves \n How well do the franchise chains perform? One \n Wall Street Journal \n reporting team did an informal assessment by hiring \"handymen all over the country and asked them to fix a wide range of problems from a relatively routine leaky faucet to a sticky door \" \n The reporter concluded that \"with few licensing requirements and standards for the industry prices are all over the board \" \n One quote was ten times as large as another \n Further the reporter concluded \"A big corporate name is no guarantee of quality or speedy service \" \n One corporate firm took three weeks to fix a stuck door \n Service varied from spotty to good with complaints about unreturned phone calls service people standing on dining room chairs leaving holes between wood planking but liked getting multiple jobs done instead of just one \n Customers liked handymen wearing hospital booties to avoid tracking dirt in houses \n The reporter chronicled one experience with repairing a water-damaged ceiling A franchise firm fixed it for $1 a second non-franchise local handyman fixed a similar ceiling for $125 \n The reporter preferred the second worker despite the fact that he \"doesn't have a fancy van -- or carry proof of insurance \" \n Tips for selecting a good handyman include ask questions get written estimates on company stationery make sure handymen guarantee their work pay with \n credit cards \n or checks because this provides an additional record of each transaction check references and licenses \n review feedback about the contractors from Internet sites To find a competent worker one can seek referrals from local sources such as a school or church or office park to see if a staff handyman does projects on the side as well as ask friends for referrals a general contractor might have workers who do projects on the side as well \n Further one can try out a new handyman with easy projects such as cleaning gutters to see how well they perform \n Tiling is another medium-level handyman job which most homeowners can do successfully provided they follow directions carefully \n Legal issues \n Generally in the United States there are few legal issues if an unpaid homeowner works on a project within their own home with some exceptions Some jurisdictions require paid handymen to be \n licensed \n and/or \n insured \n New Jersey \n for example requires all handymen who work in for-profit businesses serving residential and commercial customers to be registered and insured \n Often handymen are barred from major \n plumbing \n electrical wiring \n or \n gas-fitting \n projects for safety reasons and authorities sometimes require workers to be licensed in particular trades However minor plumbing work such as fixing water taps connecting sinks fixing leaks or installing new washing machines are usually permitted to be done without licensing Many handymen are insured under a property damage liability policy so that accidental property damage from negligence or accidents are covered \n Handymen in popular culture \n The handyman image recurs in popular culture There have been songs about handymen recorded by \n Elvis Presley \n in \n Del Shannon \n in \n James Taylor \n in \n There are femme-fatale TV characters who fall for handymen \n Handymen have been portrayed in books and films generally positively as do-gooder helpful types but not particularly smart or ambitious In a book by author \n Carolyn See \n called \n The Handyman \n a handyman is really an aspiring but discouraged artist who transforms the lives of people he works for as well as having sexual encounters with some of his clients and his experiences improve his artistic output \n The book suggests handymen discover \"the appalling loneliness of the women who call him for help\" whose needs are sometimes \"comic \" sometimes \"heartbreaking \" and deep down \"sexual \" \n A movie called \n The Handyman \n was about a carpenter-plumber who was \"good at what he does\" but is \"too honest and trusting \" and gets taken advantage of by \"women who find him handsome and understanding \" the movie earned negative reviews from critic \n Vincent Canby \n Other movies have used a rather tired formula of sexy-handyman meets bored-housewives such as \n The Ups and Downs of a Handyman \n a movie in which \"Handsome Bob also finds he's a fast favorite with the local housewives who seem to have more than small repairs on their minds \" \n In \n Canada \n there's a television show called \n Canada's Worst Handyman \n which is a reality show in which handyman contestants try their best on jobs in order to \n not \n be labeled \n worst handyman \n Home Improvement \n is an American television sitcom starring \n Tim Allen \n which aired to On the children's television show \n Mister Rogers' Neighborhood \n Handyman Negri \n was one of the characters residing in The Neighborhood of Make-Believe as well as the neighborhood Mister Rogers resides in \n Handy Manny \n is an American/Hispanic preschool television show that airs on \n Disney Junior \n and stars a handy man cartoon character named Manny The Belgian comics and media franchise \n The Smurfs \n depicts \n Handy Smurf \n with traditional handyman's accoutrements such as overalls carpenter's pencil and work hat \n List of handyman jobs \n The list of projects which handymen can do is extensive and varies from easy-to-learn tasks which take little time such as changing a light bulb to extensive projects which require multiple steps such as \n kitchen \n remodeling \n Here is a partial list \n Appraising of property \n

often practiced by those with no formal training in circuit theory or design experimenting with second-hand electronics in a DIY fashion Inexpensive keyboards \n drum machines \n and electronic children's toys not necessarily designed for music production are commonly used Haphazard modifications can result in short circuits resulting in the risk of fire burning or electrocution \n Aesthetic value immediate usability and highly randomized results are often factors in the process of successfully bending electronics Although the history of \n electronic music \n is often associated with unconventional sonic results such innovators as \n Robert Moog \n and \n Lon Theremin \n were \n electrical engineers \n and more concerned with the consistency and sound design of their instruments Circuit bending is typified by inconsistencies in instruments built in an unscientific manner While many pre-fitted circuit bent machines are on offer for sale at auction sites such as \n eBay \n this somewhat contravenes the intention of most practitioners Machines bent to a repeated configuration are more analogous to the well known practice of \"mods\" such as the Devilfish mod for the \n Roland TB-303 \n the famous \n Speak and Spell \n toys or various \n Analogman \n or Pedaldoc guitar pedal circuit modifications \n Circuit bending an audio device typically involves removing the rear panel of the device and connecting any two circuit locations with a \"jumper\" wire sending current from one part of the circuit into another Results are monitored through either the device's internal speaker or by connecting an amplifier to the speaker output If an interesting effect is achieved this connection would be marked for future reference or kept active by either soldering a new connection or bridging it with \n crocodile clips \n Often other components are inserted at these points such as pushbuttons or switches to turn the effect on or off or components such as \n resistors \n or \n capacitors \n to change the quality of the audio output This is repeated on a trial and error basis Other components added into the circuit can give the performer more expressiveness such as \n potentiometers \n photoresistors \n for reaction to light and pressure sensors \n A Yamaha PSR-6 used in a circuit bending project \n The simplest input and the one most identified with circuit bending is the body contact \n where the performer's touch causes the circuit to change the sound Often metal knobs plates screws or studs are wired to these circuit points to give easier access to these points from the outside the case of the device \n Since creative experimentation \n is a key element to the practice of circuit bending there is always a possibility that short circuiting may yield undesirable results including component failure In particular connecting the power supply or a capacitor directly to a computer chip lead can destroy the chip and make the device inoperable Before beginning to do circuit bending a person should learn the basic risk factors about working with electrical and electronic products including how to identify capacitors which can give a person a serious shock due to the electrical charge that they store and how to avoid risks with \n AC power \n For safety reasons a circuit bender should have a few basic electronics tools such as a \n multimeter \n an electronic testing device which measures voltage resistance and other factors It is advised that beginner circuit benders should \n never \n \"bend\" any device that gets its power from \n mains electricity \n household AC power as this would carry a serious risk of electrocution Circuit bending can also be carried out in interactive electronic \n audio games \n People modify their electronic games to enhance the quality of recordings used for fan-made projects or to change the speed of the game which results in a pitch change This makes the gameplay easier especially if the game gets impossibly fast Adding a knob or a switch to change the pitch of the game can lead to some disadvantages which include the game can change its' pitch slightly when it's lights are turned on and it can cause the batteries to drain out quickly on high speeds \n Innovators \n Although similar methods were previously used by other musicians and engineers this method of music creation is believed to have been pioneered by \n Reed Ghazala \n in the 1960s Ghazala's experience with circuit-bending began in when a toy \n transistor \n amplifier \n by chance shorted-out against a metal object in his desk drawer resulting in a stream of unusual sounds \n While Ghazala says that he was not the first circuit bender he coined the term Circuit Bending \n and whole-heartedly promoted the proliferation of the concept and practice through his writings and internet site earning him the title \"Father of Circuit Bending\" \n Serge Tcherepnin \n designer of the \n Serge modular synthesizers \n discussed \n his early experiments in the 1950s with the \n transistor radio \n in which he found sensitive circuit points in those simple electronic devices and brought them out to \"body contacts\" on the plastic chassis Prior to Mark's and Reed's experiments other pioneers also explored the body-contact idea one of the earliest being \n Thaddeus Cahill \n whose \n telharmonium

Competitive intelligence \n is the action of defining gathering analyzing and distributing \n intelligence \n about products customers competitors and any aspect of the environment needed to support executives and managers making strategic decisions for an organization \n Competitive intelligence essentially means understanding and learning what is happening in the world outside the business so one can be as competitive as possible It means learning as much as possible as soon as possible about one's industry in general one's competitors or even one's county's particular zoning rules In short it empowers anticipating and facing challenges head on \n Key points of this definition \n Competitive intelligence is an ethical and legal business practice as opposed to \n industrial espionage \n which is illegal \n The focus is on the external business environment \n There is a process involved in gathering information converting it into intelligence and then using it in decision making Some CI professionals erroneously emphasise that if the intelligence gathered is not usable or actionable it is not intelligence \n A more focused definition of CI regards it as the organizational function responsible for the early identification of risks and opportunities in the market before they become \n obvious \n Experts also call this process the early signal analysis This definition focuses attention on the difference between dissemination of widely available factual information such as market statistics financial reports newspaper clippings performed by functions such as libraries and information centers and competitive intelligence which is a \n perspective \n on developments and events aimed at yielding a competitive edge \n The term CI is often viewed as synonymous with \n competitor analysis \n but competitive intelligence is more than analyzing competitors it is about making the organization more competitive relative to its entire environment and stakeholders customers competitors distributors technologies and macroeconomic data \n Historic development \n Recent trends \n Similar fields \n Ethics \n Outsourcing \n Historic development \n The literature associated with the field of competitive intelligence is best exemplified by the detailed bibliographies that were published in the \n Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals \n ' refereed academic journal called \n The Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management \n Although elements of \n organizational intelligence \n collection have been a part of business for many years the history of competitive intelligence arguably began in the U S in the 1970s although the literature on the field pre-dates this time by at least several decades \n In \n Michael Porter \n published the study \n Competitive-Strategy Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors \n which is widely viewed as the foundation of modern competitive intelligence This has since been extended most notably by the pair of \n Craig Fleisher \n and \n Babette Bensoussan \n who through several popular books on competitive analysis have added commonly applied competitive intelligence analysis techniques to the practitioner's tool box \n In Leonard Fuld published his best selling book dedicated to competitor intelligence \n However the institutionalization of CI as a formal activity among American corporations can be traced to when Ben and Tamar Gilad published the first organizational model of a formal corporate CI function which was then adopted widely by US companies \n The first professional certification program CIP was created in with the establishment of The \n Fuld-Gilad-Herring Academy of Competitive Intelligence \n in \n Cambridge \n Massachusetts \n In the \n Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals \n SCIP was founded in the United States and grew in the late 1990s to around members worldwide mainly in the United States and Canada but with large numbers especially in the UK and Australia Due to financial difficulties in the organization merged with Frost & Sullivan under the Frost & Sullivan Institute SCIP has since been renamed \"Strategic & Competitive Intelligence Professionals\" to emphasise the strategic nature of the subject and also to refocus the organisation's general approach while keeping the existing SCIP brandname and logo A number of efforts have been made to discuss the field's advances in post-secondary university education covered by several authors including Blenkhorn & Fleisher \n Fleisher \n Fuld \n Prescott \n and McGonagle \n Although the general view would be that competitive intelligence concepts can be readily found and taught in many business schools around the globe there are still relatively few dedicated academic programs majors or degrees in the field a concern to academics in the field who would like to see it further researched \n These issues were widely discussed by over a dozen knowledgeable individuals in a special edition of the Competitive Intelligence Magazine that was dedicated to this topic \n In France a Specialized Master in Economic Intelligence and Knowledge Management was created in within the CERAM Business School now \n SKEMA Business School \n in Paris with the objective of delivering a full and professional training in Economic Intelligence A Centre for Global Intelligence and Influence was created in September in the same School \n On the other hand practitioners and companies regard professional accreditation as especially important in this field \n In SCIP recognized the \n Fuld-Gilad-Herring Academy of Competitive Intelligence \n 's CIP certification process as its global dual-level CIP-I and CIP-II certification program \n Global developments have also been uneven in competitive intelligence \n Several academic journals particularly the \n Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management \n in its third volume provided coverage of the field's global development \n For example in the \n cole de guerre conomique \n fr \n School of economic warfare \n was founded in Paris \n France \n It is the first European institution which teaches the tactics of economic warfare within a globalizing world In \n Germany \n competitive intelligence was unattended until the early 1990s The term \"competitive intelligence\" first appeared in German literature in In a German SCIP chapter was founded which is now second in terms of membership in Europe In summer the Institute for Competitive Intelligence was founded which provides a postgraduate certification program for Competitive Intelligence Professionals \n Japan \n is currently the only country that officially maintains an economic intelligence agency \n JETRO \n It was founded by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry \n MITI \n in \n Accepting the importance of competitive intelligence major multinational corporations such as \n ExxonMobil \n Procter & Gamble \n and \n Johnson and Johnson \n have created formal CI units \n citation needed \n Importantly organizations execute competitive intelligence activities not only as a safeguard to protect against market threats and changes but also as a method for finding new opportunities and trends \n Organizations use competitive intelligence to compare themselves to other organizations \"competitive benchmarking\" to identify risks and opportunities in their markets and to pressure-test their plans against market response war gaming which enable them to make informed decisions Most firms today realize the importance of knowing what their competitors are doing and how the industry is changing and the information gathered allows organizations to understand their strengths and weaknesses \n One of the major activities involved in corporate competitive intelligence is use of ratio analysis using key performance indicators KPI Organizations compare annual reports of their competitors on certain KPI and ratios which are intrinsic to their industry This helps them track their performance vis-a-vis their competitors \n citation needed \n The actual importance of these categories of information to an organization depends on the contestability of its markets the organizational culture the personality and biases of its top decision makers and the reporting structure of competitive intelligence within the company \n Strategic Intelligence \n SI focuses on the longer term looking at issues affecting a company's competitiveness over the course of a couple of years The actual time horizon for SI ultimately depends on the industry and how quickly it's changing The general questions that SI answers are Where should we as a company be in X years?' and 'What are the strategic risks and opportunities facing us?' This type of intelligence work involves among others the identification of weak signals and application of methodology and process called Strategic Early Warning SEW first introduced by Gilad \n followed by Steven Shaker and Victor Richardson \n Alessandro Comai and Joaquin Tena \n and others According to Gilad 20% of the work of competitive intelligence practitioners should be dedicated to strategic early identification of weak signals within a SEW framework \n Tactical Intelligence \n the focus is on providing information designed to improve shorter-term decisions most often related with the intent of growing market share or revenues Generally it is the type of information that you would need to support the sales process in an organization It investigates various aspects of a product/product line marketing \n citation needed \n Product what are people selling? \n Price what price are they charging? \n Promotion what activities are they conducting for promoting this product? \n Place where are they selling this product? \n Other sales force structure clinical trial design technical issues etc \n With the right amount of information organizations can avoid unpleasant surprises by anticipating competitors' moves and decreasing response time Examples of competitive intelligence research is evident in daily newspapers such as the \n Wall Street Journal \n Business Week \n and \n Fortune \n Major airlines change hundreds of fares daily in response to competitors' tactics They use information to plan their own marketing pricing and production strategies \n Resources such as the Internet have made gathering information on competitors easy With a click of a button analysts can discover future trends and market requirements However competitive intelligence is much more than this as the ultimate aim is to lead to \n competitive advantage \n As the Internet is mostly public domain material information gathered is less likely to result in insights that will be unique to the company In fact there is a risk that information gathered from the Internet will be misinformation and mislead users so competitive intelligence researchers are often wary of using such information \n As a result although the Internet is viewed as a key source most CI professionals should spend their time and budget gathering intelligence using primary researchnetworking with industry experts from \n trade shows \n and conferences from their own customers and suppliers and so on Where the Internet is used it is to gather sources for primary research as well as information on what the company says about itself and its online presence in the form of links to other companies its strategy regarding search engines and online advertising mentions in discussion forums and on blogs etc Also important are online subscription databases and news aggregation sources which have simplified the secondary source collection process Social media sources are also becoming importantproviding potential interviewee names as well as opinions and attitudes and sometimes breaking news e g via \n Twitter \n Organizations must be careful not to spend too much time and effort on old competitors without realizing the existence of any new competitors Knowing more about your competitors will allow your business to grow and succeed The practice of competitive intelligence is growing every year and most companies and business students now realize the importance of knowing their competitors \n According to Arjan Singh and Andrew Beurschgens in their article in the \n Competitive Intelligence Review \n there are four stages of development of a competitive intelligence capability with a firm It starts with \"stick fetching\" where a CI department is very reactive up to \"world class\" where it is completely integrated in the decision-making process \n Recent trends \n This section \n needs additional citations for \n verification \n Please help \n

questions the appropriateness of the term comparing it to business intelligence competitor intelligence knowledge management market intelligence marketing research and strategic intelligence \n Fleisher \n verification needed \n suggests that business intelligence has two forms Its narrow contemporary form is more focused on information technology and internal focus than CI while its broader historical definition is more inclusive than CI Knowledge management KM when improperly achieved is seen as an information-technology driven organizational practice relying on data mining corporate

shorter time horizon than other intelligence areas and is measured in days weeks or in slower-moving industries months \n Market research is a tactical method-driven field consisting of neutral primary research of customer data beliefs and perceptions gathered in surveys or focus groups and is analyzed with statistical-research techniques \n CI draws on a wider variety primary and secondary of sources from a wider range of stakeholders suppliers competitors distributors substitutes and media to answer existing questions raise new ones and guide action \n verification needed \n Ben Gilad and Jan Herring lay down a set of prerequisites defining CI distinguishing it from other information-rich disciplines such as market research or business development They show that a common body of knowledge and a unique set of tools key intelligence topics \n business war games \n and \n blindspots analysis \n distinguish CI while other sensory activities in a commercial firm focus on \n one \n segment of the market customers suppliers or acquisition targets CI synthesizes data from all high-impact players HIP \n Gilad later focused his delineation of CI on the difference between information and intelligence According to him the common denominator among organizational sensory functions whether they are called market research business intelligence or market intelligence is that they deliver information rather than intelligence Intelligence says Gilad is a perspective on facts rather than the facts themselves Unique among corporate functions competitive intelligence has a perspective of risks and opportunities for a firm's performance as such it not information activities is part of an organization's risk-management activity \n Ethics \n Ethics has been a long-held issue of discussion among CI practitioners \n Essentially the questions revolve around what is and is not allowable in terms of CI practitioners' activity A number of excellent scholarly treatments have been generated on this topic most prominently addressed through Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals publications \n The book \n Competitive Intelligence Ethics Navigating the Gray Zone \n provides nearly twenty separate views about ethics in CI as well as another codes used by various individuals or organizations \n Combining that with the over two dozen scholarly articles or

structures moved in modules see \n modular building \n Modular design \n or \" \n modularity \n in design\" is a design approach that subdivides a system into smaller parts called modules or \n skids \n that can be independently created and then used in different systems A modular system can be characterized by functional partitioning into discrete scalable reusable modules rigorous use of well-defined modular interfaces and making use of industry standards for interfaces \n Besides reduction in cost due to less customization and shorter learning time and flexibility in design modularity offers other benefits such as augmentation adding new solution by merely plugging in a new module and exclusion Examples of modular systems are \n cars \n computers \n process systems \n solar panels \n and \n wind turbines \n elevators \n and modular buildings Earlier examples include \n looms \n railroad signaling \n systems \n telephone exchanges \n pipe organs \n and \n electric power distribution \n systems Computers use modularity to overcome changing customer demands and to make the manufacturing process more adaptive to change see \n modular programming \n Modular design is an attempt to combine the advantages of \n standardization \n high volume normally equals low manufacturing costs with those of \n customization \n A downside to modularity and this depends on the extent of modularity is that low quality modular systems are not optimized for performance This is usually due to the cost of putting up interfaces between modules \n In vehicles \n In machines and architecture \n In televisions \n In computer hardware \n Recent evolution \n Further reading \n In vehicles \n Electric vehicle \n and \n Wikispeed \n The modular design of the \n Unimog \n offers attachment capabilities for various different \n implements \n Aspects of modular design can be seen in cars or other \n vehicles \n to the extent of there being certain parts to the car that can be added or removed without altering the rest of the car \n A simple example of modular design in cars is the fact that while many cars come as a basic model paying extra will allow for \"snap in\" upgrades such as a more powerful engine or seasonal tires these do not require any change to other units of the car such as the chassis steering electric motor or battery systems \n In machines and architecture \n Modular building \n Modular design can be seen in certain buildings Modular buildings and also modular homes generally consist of universal parts or modules that are manufactured in a \n factory \n and then shipped to a build site where they are assembled into a variety of arrangements \n Modular buildings can be added to or reduced in size by adding or removing certain components This can be done without altering larger portions of the building Modular buildings can also undergo changes in functionality using the same process of adding or removing components \n Modular workstations \n For example an \n office \n building can be built using modular parts such as walls frames doors ceilings and windows The interior can then be partitioned or divided with more walls and furnished with desks computers and whatever else is needed for a functioning workspace If the office needs to be expanded or redivided to accommodate employees modular components such as wall panels can be added or relocated to make the necessary changes without altering the whole building Later this same office can be broken down and rearranged to form a \n retail \n space \n conference hall \n or another type of building using the same modular components that originally formed the office building The new building can then be refurnished with whatever items are needed to carry out its desired functions \n Other types of modular buildings that are offered from a company like Allied Modular include a \n guardhouse \n machine enclosure \n press box \n conference room \n two-story building \n clean room \n and many more applications \n Many misconceptions are held regarding modular buildings \n In reality modular construction is a viable method of construction for quick turnaround and fast growing companies Industries that would benefit from this include healthcare commercial retail military and multi-family/student housing \n In televisions \n In \n Motorola \n introduced the first rectangular color picture tube and in introduced the modular \n Quasar \n brand In it opened its first research and development branch outside of the United States in Israel under the management of Moses Basin In Motorola sold its television business to the Japan-based Matsushita the parent company of Panasonic \n In computer hardware \n Modular computer design \n Modular design in computer hardware is the same as in other things e g cars refrigerators and furniture The idea is to build computers with easily replaceable parts that use standardized interfaces This technique allows a user to upgrade certain aspects of the computer easily without having to buy another computer altogether This idea is also being implemented in \n Project Ara \n which provides a platform for manufactures to create modules for a smartphone which can then be customised by the end user \n A computer is one of the best examples of modular design Typical modules include \n power supply units \n processors \n mainboards \n graphics cards \n hard drives \n and \n optical drives \n All of these parts should be easily interchangeable as long as the user uses parts that support the same standard interface Similar to the computer's modularity other tools have been developed to leverage modular design such as \n littleBits Electronics \n which snap together with interoperable modules to create circuits \n Recent evolution \n Some authors observe that modular design has generated in the vehicle industry a constant increase of weight over time Trancossi \n advanced the hypothesis that modular design can be coupled by some optimization criteria derived from the \n constructal law \n In fact the constructal law is modular for his nature and can apply with interesting results in engineering simple systems \n It applies with a typical bottom-up optimization schema \n a system can be divided into subsystems elemental parts using tree models \n any complex system can be represented in a modular way and it is possible to describe how different physical magnitudes flow through the system \n analysing the different flowpaths it is possible to identify the critical components that affect the performance of the system \n by optimizing those components and substituting them with more performing ones it is possible to improve the performances of the system \n A better formulation has been produced during the MAAT EU FP7 Project \n A new design method that couples the above bottom-up optimization with a preliminary system level top-down design has been formulated \n The two step design process has been motivated by considering that constructal and modular design does not refer to any objective to be reached in the design process A theoretical formulation has been provided in a recent paper \n and applied with success to the design of a small aircraft \n the conceptual design of innovative commuter aircraft \n the design ofa new entropic wall \n and an innovative off-road vehicle designed for energy efficiency \n Look up \n beam \n in Wiktionary the free dictionary \n 3D printing \n Configuration design \n Constructal law \n Holarchy

electric Many people prefer to pick a vehicle that is light and aerodynamic in order to maximize distance traveled per battery charge There must also be adequate room and load capacity for batteries \n The \n battery pack \n which provides a source of electrical power The most commonly available and affordable batteries are \n lead-acid \n flooded type Next are the \n AGM Absorption Glass Mat \n sealed maintenance free batteries a little more powerful and expensive Then there are the more exotic batteries like \n Ni-MH \n and \n Li-ion \n more difficult to find but light and longer lasting maintenance free and much more expensive The new lithium batteries are showing some promise for EVs in the near future \n The charger which restores energy to the batteries which may be mounted within the vehicle or at a special charging station at some fixed location \n The \n power controller \n which regulates the flow of energy between the \n battery \n and the \n electric motor \n s controlled by an \n electronic throttle \n One or more electric motors and their mechanical attachment to the \n driveline \n Power conductors \n connecting the battery controller and motor s \n Accessory equipment to power auxiliary equipment such as power brakes and heating system \n Control circuitry and equipment to allow control and interlocking of the various components \n Instrumentation specific to the operation and maintenance of the conversion \n Solar power \n Solar vehicle \n Solar cells could be used to power a vehicle converted to electric \n However currently the relatively small power generated by solar cells means that the other components in the system must be special to compensate for this For example the body of even a small conventional car converted to electric is still rather too heavy to be able to be matched with an electric system that is solely or primarily charged by solar power Thus it is usually more practical to create a solar-powered electric vehicle from scratch or specially made parts \n Conversion process \n Most conversions in North America are performed by hobbyists \n who typically will convert a well used vehicle with a non-functioning engine since such defective vehicles can be quite inexpensive to purchase Other hobbyists with larger budgets may prefer to convert a later model vehicle or a vehicle of a particular type In some cases the vehicle itself may be built by the converter or assembled from a \n kit car \n A two-stage vehicle is a vehicle that has been built by two separate manufacturers The result is a standard complete vehicle \n In this process vehicles may be converted by a manufacturer as was done by \n Ford Motor Company \n to create the \n Ford Ranger EV \n Alternatively in a process known as \"third-party \n power trainization \n \" an independent converter will purchase new \n vehicle gliders \n vehicles without a motor or related equipment and then perform the conversion to offer a two-stage vehicle \n In some countries the user can choose to buy a converted vehicle of any model in the \n automaker dealerships \n only paying the cost of the batteries and motor with no installation costs it is called pre-conversion or previous conversion \n Industry \n The electric vehicle conversion industry has grown to include conversion car \n garages \n aftermarket kits \n and vehicle components \n Vehicle types \n Electric bicycle \n A bicycle with an aftermarket hub-motor in the front wheel \n An \n electric bicycle \n is a conventional bicycle that has been fitted with an electric motor Converting an existing bicycle by retrofitting it with a \"conversion kit\" is the simplest and least expensive electric vehicle conversion option Most often electric bicycles or \"e-bikes\" are powered by rechargeable batteries however some experimental electric bicycles run directly on or recharge their batteries via solar panels fuel cells gas generators or other alternative energy sources Some experimenters have even used super capacitors to store energy Using an on-board generator may impact the legal jurisdictional definition of an electric bicycle A few types of electric bicycles are able to re-capture a small amount of energy from braking and can re-charge the batteries while braking or traveling down hills regenerative braking \n Some electric bikes have features where the motor can move the bicycle by itself immediate start if the rider chooses not to pedal with a button or throttle controller while others require the rider to pedal at all times pedal assist This latter type may in some jurisdictions allow the vehicle to be used on bicycle trails that otherwise prohibit motorized vehicles of any kind See \n motorized bicycle \n Many battery technologies are available for powering electric bikes The most common and least expensive battery technology is sealed lead acid but \n LiFePO \n is fast becoming the battery of choice for the e-bike \n Converting one's bike to electric with a conversion kit is an easy and affordable solution for most people interested in learning more about electric vehicle conversion \n There may be some problems with the warranty however on the original bicycle being converted if an electric bike conversion kit is added \n Electric Two-Wheelers E-Bikes Motorcycles and Scooters \n Electric scooter \n Custom drag bike \n Converted Electric Motorcycle \n Solar cruiser \n Low-speed Scooters are not typically suitable for on-the-road use These may be configured for either standing or sitting use Some local laws apply bicycle laws to scooters such as helmet and pedestrian right-of-way considerations \n Economy coupe \n This elderly \n Fiat \n employs batteries that can be mounted in any position \n Owing to its light weight and efficiency a light vehicle can make an excellent choice particularly if care is taken in component selection and placement It is possible to obtain conversion kits for some popular light vehicles most notably the rear motor rear drive \n Volkswagen Beetle \n its \n Type \n evolution and its successor the front motor/drive \n VW Golf \n By converting a light vehicle it is possible to use a smaller motor which both weighs and costs less than a larger motor A lighter overall vehicle weight will reduce power consumption in start-and-stop traffic and increase range in many practical driving conditions In the same way that a gasoline-powered economy car is cheaper and more efficient to run an electric-powered economy car is as well \n Compact sedan or coupe \n A compact sedan may be a better choice than a subcompact owing to better load capacity and more room for battery placement Some commercial EV Conversions use vehicles in this size range One example is a \n Honda Civic \n In this conversion the back seat was retained and there is still enough room to sink nine flooded lead-acid batteries low in the trunk where the spare tire was located as well as another nine batteries under the hood Another example is a \n Mitsubishi Tredia \n where the rear batteries have been raised above the trunk floorspace sealed and externally vented With suspension modifications increasing shock length & spring rating the car must still be below \n GVWR \n even with the driver and passengers Exceeding the total design weight of the vehicle would be illegal in some states and might result in cancellation by an insurance company \n There is an effort by several engineers in California to make the \n Toyota Prius \n a \" \n Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle \n \" or PHEV whereby the first miles are driven by all-electric power then the gas engine comes on to re-charge the batteries only if the commute is further than 40mi If it is less one can just plug it into the utility grid to re-charge the batteries The process is done by removing the \n nickel-metal hydride batteries \n and installing different batteries and a different battery management system \n Since April the \n Electric Car Corporation \n have been selling the \n Citron C1 ev'ie \n an all-electric conversion from the \n Citron C1 \n Full-size sedan \n Full-size sedans \n and \n minivans \n are generally considered to be poor candidates for EV conversion As the suspension and tires are already operating close to the maximum permissible \n clarification needed \n it may be necessary to make substantial modifications in these areas It may be easier to obtain upgraded suspension components for some smaller vehicles if these are also typically used for sports racing particularly \n autocross \n Starting with a heavy vehicle and adding batteries will result in poor performance in acceleration handling braking and economy of operation \n One of possibilities is using the body of Audi's D2 platform A8 \n Audi A8 \n or sports sedan S8 or older European market models where the German model weights 1730kg \n Audi S8 \n both of which are all \n aluminium \n monocoque \n \" \n Audi Space Frame \n \" vehicle which helped to significantly reduce weight without being any less rigid \n Sports car \n For a person interested in sports car performance and appearance the creation of a satisfying conversion will likely lead to a number of difficulties in such details as battery disposition as such vehicles generally have available space distributed in small volumes around the vehicle This leads to complexity in securing and wiring batteries These vehicles can offer stunning performance in the lower speed ranges owing to light weight and rear wheel drive and may also offer good range due to their superior aerodynamics \n The \n Porsche \n is one of the more successful sports car conversions as well as being one of the most popular Once converted it boasts better performance in range acceleration and top speed than most other vehicles Also its low acquisition costs contributes to its popularity as a conversion candidate Some manufacturers of conversion kits have made a kit specific to the \n Another popular sports car used for conversion is the \n Toyota MR2 \n Reasons for its popularity are low weight before conversion low cost to purchase the car and available locations within the car to place the large batteries that most people use lead-acid and its derivative technologies The later MR2 body style Mark does not seem as popular and as of March there is only one known conversion \n A Mitsubishi Starion was converted to all-electric in by Carmel Morris and Nathan Bolton in Australia This sports vehicle had divided front/rear battery load for well-balanced low center of gravity performance The battery pack consisted of x 2v nominal lithium ion batteries The tar weight of the final result was not much greater than the original specification allowing the sports car to be engineering road-certified as a four-seat vehicle The builders wanted to prove that an electric car conversion could also include other options such as power steering and air conditioning as is the norm for new electric vehicles without sacrificing excess energy or comfort Information on the successful Electric Starion conversion can be found on the web \n The \n Bradley \n GT II as well as other VW-based \n kit cars \n are very popular conversion candidates due to their being inexpensive extensive support groups as well as their simple sports car design Availability of conversion kits for these cars are quite prevalent with commercial retail establishments that specialize in EV conversions \n Light truck \n Light trucks are especially suitable for hobbyist conversion because it is easy to locate batteries remote from the passenger compartment and there is a good load handling capacity for the use of heavy batteries such as the flooded lead-acid batteries commonly used in golf carts Light trucks also offer substantial utility in use simply because they are trucks Even if a portion of the weight capacity is removed by the presence of batteries within or below the cargo bed much or all of the spatial utility remains A light truck is highly recommended as a first conversion effort because of the simplicity of component layout With proper battery placement the stability of a late production truck can be improved over the \n ICE \n version While a number of suitable vehicles are available in pre-2002 models the modern evolution of this type has become taller heavier bulkier and less efficient and their excessive height makes under-bed battery placement essential to keep the center of gravity low enough for stability on curves \n Other trucks full size and most SUVs \n These are rarely converted due to their excessive weight and aerodynamic inefficiencies To make the situation worse many modern trucks and SUVs continue to get bulkier heavier and their high stance means the height of the center of gravity leads to instability while making high speed turns a distinct disadvantage if there is not enough room between the frame rails to enable low battery mounting As a direct result the payload carrying capacity and thus the GVWR of the vehicles goes down Such a trait is not desirable because it limits the weight of the battery pack that can be carried limiting the maximum battery-to-vehicle weight ratio that could be achieved for the vehicle when converted to an EV Such considerations are important due to price weight and performance limitations of current battery technologies For a given battery type reducing the battery-to-vehicle weight ratio always results in reduced vehicle range per charge However despite these mostly unavoidable limitations several SUVs and larger trucks have been successfully converted to electric power by hobbyists Some examples include the \"Gone Postal\" van converted to an \n EV racer \n by \n Roderick Wilde \n and Suckamps EV Racing the \n Land Rover \n EV converted by \n Wilde Evolutions \n and the \n Jeep Cherokee \n EV converted by \n Nick Viera \n Classic Cars \n Although technologically feasible classic cars are not widely converted in order to maintain a car's authenticity The German company ReeVOLT has however made it one of their business branches to convert old \n Trabants \n for use in tourism in the east of Germany in connection to the car's regional historic significance and to allow easy access to environmental zones such as city centers and in particular the partially car-free island of \n Rgen \n The car is considered ideal for conversions because of its low used price and low weight due to the small size and resin fiber construction \n Electric buses \n The principal efforts in the development of autonomous \n electric buses \n this is without \n trolleys and wires \n have involved limited production of very expensive \n fuel cell vehicles \n The most economically effective development in this area involves the creation of \n hybrid electric buses \n mainly \n plug-in hybrids \n well suited to this application owing to frequent stops and starts and effective energy recovery and release in this cycle \n Another solution is the conversion to \n battery electric buses \n that follow the principle of \n replacing discharged batteries \n instead of recharging \n Racers \n Hotrod \n While this type of vehicle is usually made to be a \" \n street-legal \n \" performance machine it may also be developed for occasional use as a \n drag racing \n vehicle The leading vehicle in this field is the \"Maniac Mazda\" a Mazda RX-7 sports car converted from rotary engine to electric by Roderick Wilde \n This vehicle can outrun Dodge Viper and Ferrari sports cars in quarter-mile drag races \n Autocross racer \n EV's have proven successful in autocross competition The electric motor's ability to deliver maximum torque at RPM and a comparatively broad torque band provide good throttle response and allow running an autocross without any time lost to shifting gears The short distance of the typical autocross requires less stored energy than most forms of motorsports This minimizes electric vehicle's most obvious competitive disadvantage the weight penalty of batteries compared to gasoline \n Drag racer \n Intended only for specialized straight line quarter-mile acceleration racing this type of vehicle is used only \"off road\" at specialized \" \n dragstrips \n \" \n High speed straight line racer \n For an example of a straight line racer see \n Buckeye Bullet \n Even more specialized than the drag racer this is intended to obtain high speeds on long straight and flat raceways such as the dry lake beds found in locations such as the \n Bonneville Salt Flats \n Closed circuit road racer \n Closed Circuit \n Road racing \n particularly any type of endurance racing is one of the greatest challenges for EV's Pound per pound gasoline contains far more energy than even the most advanced of current batteries An electric vehicle must be heavier or more efficient to run the same distance as its gasoline competitor Endurance racing strategies include battery packs that can be changed quickly and \" \n Dump charging \n \" \n Custom chassis \n Suitable for a builder who is capable of constructing a kit car with good abilities and equipment in machining and \n welding \n this can result in a unique vehicle It is especially suitable for the construction of a lightweight vehicle that can offer exceptional performance Many VW-based kit car companies have tube chassis ready to start with \n A glider kit includes all components of a vehicle except the \n power train \n Novelty vehicle \n A \n novelty vehicle \n or an electric powered \n art car \n may not be suitable for on road use Applications include electric vehicle show demonstrations parades parade floats float towing and eclectic off-road gatherings such as \n Burning Man \n This vehicle is ideal for the \n beach \n where not prohibited and to promote \n tourist \n places but will usually require trailering to its operating site \n Atthe2005StanfordUniversityEVGathering \n Above \n Bob Schneeveis \n demonstrates his \n Silver Sofa \n Registration of converted and newly constructed vehicles \n Vehicle registration \n United States \n The ease of registration will vary by state Some states require safety inspections usually to ensure body integrity in areas subject to severe corrosion from winter road de-icing materials In any case for general registration all functional safety equipment should be operating turn signals brake lights headlights horn etc The windshield should have no running cracks small stone chips and \"stars\" may be acceptable if not in the driver's principal line of vision If the vehicle has been reconstructed from a salvage vehicle a vehicle whose registration has been forfeited inspection may be more severe to ensure compliance and the legitimacy of sources of salvage components by presentation of proper purchase receipts \n Registration procedures will vary by state and will usually be more difficult even bizarre in states with strict emissions requirements even though a plug-in only conversion will be a zero emission vehicle Arguing with DMV staff is typically futile in all jurisdictions but there may be appeal procedures available but whose availability may not be openly publicized \n On the other hand changing the registration allows a conversion to qualify for tax incentives available in some states such as Oregon for either the vehicle the charging system or both \n California US conversion registration and taxation \n Registration of a converted existing or newly self constructed electric vehicle in California is no longer difficult \n This falls into two categories First if the vehicle is built from new frame components and possibly some salvage parts \n i e \n it has never been a previously titled motorcar previously but it has brakes or axles that were obtained used/rebuilt In California if you \"create\" a car from scratch and want to register and title it with DMV you need to go through the \"Specially Constructed Vehicle Emission Control Program\" or SPCNS for short this is also called California \"SB100\" program Or Second a previously registered vehicle converted to electric propulsion \n SPCNC In the past the process of registering an SPCNS vehicle required meeting with an outside referee at a community college or one of the states mobile referee stations to verify the vehicle The current process happens at the DMV with the inspection being done by A DMV inspector The inspector will need to be able to see the motor and batteries and verify that there in no internal combustion engine The vehicle will still need a brake and light inspection By an outside inspector to verify its compliance with other vehicle codes \n Currently Registered Vehicles If you are converting an existing vehicle and it is older than you may opt to not bother to get the vehicle converted to the \"E\" code unless you are looking for the Diamond Lane stickers since these vehicles don't require a smog inspection For vehicles newer than you will need to go the DMV and have the vehicle inspected as a conversion The batteries and motor will have to be exposed so the inspector can see them and verify that there is no internal combustion engine \n The next step requires the clerk at the local California Department of Motor Vehicles DMV office to call the Sacramento office Only the Sacramento office can make this entry into the computer system If the local clerk tries the system will default to the \"Q\" code for hybrid These procedures are in place to inhibit fraudulent registration of ICE vehicles as Electric in order to avoid smog inspections A hybrid is not exempt from smog inspection Before you leave the DMV make sure your printout has the proper \"E\" code or you will have to go back to do it again \n There is weight fee of $87 for vehicles under 700kg 000lb or $266 for vehicles from to 500kg to 000lb This is in addition to any regular registration fees \n Spain \n In Spain the conversion called transformation is regulated by \n Real Decreto \n 866/2010 de de julio por el que se regula la tramitacin de las reformas de vehculos \n Aftermarket automotive \n CalCars \n Electric car \n Engine swap \n Green tuning \n Kit car \n Maker culture \n Plug-in hybrid \n PHEV \n Vehicle glider"},

2000s \n As the various additive processes matured it became clear that soon metal removal would no longer be the only \n metalworking \n process done under that type of control a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer It was during this decade that the term \n subtractive manufacturing \n appeared as a \n retronym \n for the large family of machining processes with metal removal as their common theme At this time the term \n 3D printing \n still referred only to the polymer technologies in most minds and the term \n AM \n was likelier to be used in metalworking and end use part production contexts than among polymer/inkjet/stereolithography enthusiasts \n By the early 2010s the terms \n 3D printing \n and \n additive manufacturing \n evolved \n senses \n in which they were alternate umbrella terms for AM technologies one being used in popular vernacular by consumer-maker communities and the media and the other used more formally by industrial AM end use part producers AM machine manufacturers and global technical standards organizations Until recently the term \n 3D printing \n has been associated with machines low-end in price or in capability \n Both terms reflect the simple fact that the technologies all share the common theme of sequential-layer material addition/joining throughout a 3D work envelope under automated control Other terms that had been used as AM synonyms although sometimes as \n hypernyms \n included \n desktop manufacturing \n rapid manufacturing \n agile tooling \n as the logical production-level successor to \n rapid prototyping \n and \n on-demand manufacturing \n which echoes \n on-demand printing \n in the 2D sense of \n printing \n The 2010s were the first decade in which metal end use parts such as engine brackets \n and large nuts \n would be grown either before or instead of machining in \n job production \n rather than \n obligately \n being machined from \n bar stock \n or plate Today the term \n subtractive \n has not replaced the term \n machining \n instead \n complementing \n it when a term that covers any removal method is needed It is still the case that casting fabrication stamping and machining are more prevalent than AM in metalworking but AM is now beginning to make significant inroads and with the advantages of \n design for additive manufacturing \n it is clear to engineers that much more is to come \n Agile tooling \n is a term used to describe the process of using modular means to design tooling that is produced by additive manufacturing or 3D printing methods to enable quick \n prototyping \n and responses to tooling and fixture needs Agile tooling uses a cost effective and high quality method to quickly respond to customer and market needs It can be used in \n hydro-forming \n stamping \n injection molding \n and other manufacturing processes \n Early additive manufacturing equipment and materials were developed in the 1980s \n In Hideo Kodama of Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute invented two additive methods for fabricating three-dimensional plastic models with photo-hardening \n thermoset polymer \n where the \n UV exposure \n area is controlled by a \n mask pattern \n or a scanning fiber transmitter \n On July \n Alain Le Mhaut \n Olivier de Witte and Jean Claude Andr filed their patent for the \n stereolithography \n process \n The application of the French inventors was abandoned by the French General Electric Company now Alcatel-Alsthom and CILAS The Laser Consortium \n The claimed reason was \"for lack of business perspective\" \n Three weeks later in \n Chuck Hull \n of \n 3D Systems \n Corporation \n filed his own patent for a \n stereolithography \n fabrication system in which layers are added by curing \n photopolymers \n with \n ultraviolet light \n lasers \n Hull defined the process as a \"system for generating three-dimensional objects by creating a cross-sectional pattern of the object to be formed \" \n Hull's contribution was the \n STL Stereolithography file format \n and the digital slicing and infill strategies common to many processes today \n The technology used by most 3D printers to dateespecially hobbyist and consumer-oriented modelsis \n fused deposition modeling \n a special application of plastic \n extrusion \n developed in by \n S Scott Crump \n and commercialized by his company \n Stratasys \n which marketed its first FDM machine in \n The term \n 3D printing \n originally referred to a powder bed process employing standard and custom \n inkjet \n print heads developed at \n MIT \n in and commercialized by \n Z Corporation \n The year also saw the start of a company called \n Solidscape \n introducing a high-precision polymer jet fabrication system with soluble support structures categorized as a \"dot-on-dot\" technique \n AM processes for metal sintering or melting such as \n selective laser sintering \n direct metal laser sintering \n and \n selective laser melting \n usually went by their own individual names in the 1980s and 1990s At the time all metalworking was done by processes that we now call non-additive \n casting \n fabrication \n stamping \n and \n machining \n although plenty of \n automation \n was applied to those technologies such as by \n robot welding \n and \n CNC \n the idea of a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of \n raw material \n into a desired shape layer by layer was associated in metalworking only with processes that removed metal rather than adding it such as CNC \n milling \n CNC \n EDM \n and many others But the automated techniques that \n added \n metal which would later be called additive manufacturing were beginning to challenge that assumption By the mid-1990s new techniques for material deposition were developed at \n Stanford \n and \n Carnegie Mellon University \n including microcasting \n and sprayed materials \n Sacrificial and support materials had also become more common enabling new object geometries \n As technology matured several authors had begun to speculate that 3D printing could aid in \n sustainable development \n in the developing world \n General principles \n Modeling \n 3D modeling \n 3D printable models may be created with a \n computer-aided design \n CAD package via a \n 3D scanner \n or by a plain \n digital camera \n and \n photogrammetry software \n 3D printed models created with CAD result in reduced errors and can be corrected before printing allowing verification in the design of the object before it is printed \n CAD \n model used for 3D printing \n The manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting 3D scanning is a process of collecting digital data on the shape and appearance of a real object creating a digital model based on it \n Printing \n Play media \n Timelapse \n video of a \n hyperboloid \n object designed by \n George W Hart \n made of \n PLA \n using a RepRap \"Prusa Mendel\" 3D printer for molten polymer deposition \n Before printing a 3D model from an \n STL \n file it must first be examined for errors Most \n CAD \n applications produce errors in output STL files \n holes faces normals self-intersections noise shells or manifold errors \n A step in the STL generation known as \"repair\" fixes such problems in the original model \n Generally STLs that have been produced from a model obtained through \n 3D scanning \n often have more of these errors \n This is due to how 3D scanning works-as it is often by point to point acquisition reconstruction will include errors in most cases \n Once completed the STL file needs to be processed by a piece of software called a \"slicer \" which converts the model into a series of thin layers and produces a \n G-code \n file containing instructions tailored to a specific type of 3D printer \n FDM printers \n citation needed \n This G-code file can then be printed with 3D printing client software which loads the G-code and uses it to instruct the 3D printer during the 3D

machines can print layers as thin as m 600DPI \n X-Y resolution is comparable to that of \n laser printers \n The particles 3D dots are around to m to 250DPI in diameter \n citation needed \n Construction of a model with contemporary methods can take anywhere from several hours to several days depending on the method used and the size and complexity of the model Additive systems can typically reduce this time to a few hours although it varies widely depending on the type of machine used and the size and number of models being produced simultaneously \n Traditional techniques like \n injection moulding \n can be less expensive for manufacturing \n polymer \n products in high quantities but additive manufacturing can be faster more flexible and less expensive when producing relatively small quantities of parts 3D printers give designers and concept development teams the ability to produce parts and concept models using a desktop size printer \n Seemingly \n paradoxic \n more complex objects can be cheaper for 3D printing production than less complex objects \n Finishing \n Though the printer-produced resolution is sufficient for many applications printing a slightly oversized version of the desired object in standard resolution and then removing material \n with a higher-resolution subtractive process can achieve greater precision \n Some printable polymers such as \n ABS \n allow the surface finish to be smoothed and improved using chemical vapor processes \n based on \n acetone \n or similar solvents \n Some additive manufacturing techniques are capable of using multiple materials in the course of constructing parts These techniques are able to print in multiple colors and color combinations simultaneously and would not necessarily require painting \n Some printing techniques require internal supports to be built for overhanging features during construction These supports must be mechanically removed or dissolved upon completion of the print \n All of the commercialized metal 3D printers involve cutting the metal component off the metal substrate after deposition A new process for the \n GMAW \n 3D printing allows for substrate surface modifications to remove \n aluminum \n or \n steel \n Processes and printers \n 3D printing processes \n Schematic representation of the 3D printing technique known as Fused Filament Fabrication a filament \n a \n of plastic material is fed through a heated moving head \n b \n that melts and extrudes it depositing it layer after layer in the desired shape \n c \n A moving platform \n e \n lowers after each layer is deposited For this kind of technology additional vertical support structures \n d \n are needed to sustain overhanging parts \n Play media \n A timelapse video of a robot model logo of \n Make magazine \n being printed using FDM on a RepRapPro Fisher printer \n A large number of additive processes are available The main differences between processes are in the way layers are deposited to create parts and in the materials that are used Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks which is why some companies offer a choice of powder and polymer for the material used to build the object \n Others sometimes use standard off-the-shelf business paper as the build material to produce a durable prototype The main considerations in choosing a machine are generally speed costs of the 3D printer of the printed prototype choice and cost of the materials and color capabilities \n Printers that work directly with metals are generally expensive However less expensive printers can be used to make a mold which is then used to make metal parts \n Some methods melt or soften the material to produce the layers In \n Fused filament fabrication \n also known as \n Fused deposition modeling \n FDM the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers A filament of \n thermoplastic \n metal wire or other material is fed into an \n extrusion \n nozzle head \n 3D printer extruder \n which heats the material and turns the flow on and off FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece \n Laser sintering techniques include \n selective laser sintering \n with both metals and polymers and \n direct metal laser sintering \n Selective laser melting \n does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties similar to those of conventional manufactured metals \n Electron beam melting \n is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts e g \n titanium alloys \n EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum \n Another method consists of an \n inkjet 3D printing \n system which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder \n plaster \n or \n resins \n and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process With \n laminated object manufacturing \n thin layers are cut to shape and joined together \n Schematic representation of Stereolithography a light-emitting device \n a \n laser or DLP selectively illuminate the transparent bottom \n c \n of a tank \n b \n filled with a liquid photo-polymerizing resin the solidified resin \n d \n is progressively dragged up by a lifting platform \n e \n Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies such as \n stereolithography \n Photopolymerization \n is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid Inkjet printer systems like the \n Objet PolyJet \n system spray \n photopolymer \n materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers between and 30m until the part is completed Each photopolymer layer is \n cured \n with UV light after it is jetted producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately without post-curing Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in \n multiphoton \n photopolymerisation Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts \n Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using \n LEDs \n In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it in the shape of the layer \n Continuous liquid interface production \n begins with a pool of liquid \n photopolymer \n resin \n Part of the pool bottom is transparent to \n ultraviolet light \n the \"window\" which causes the resin to solidify The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object \n In powder-fed directed-energy deposition a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment \n As of October additive manufacturing systems were on the market that ranged from $2 to $500 in price and were employed in industries including aerospace architecture automotive defense and medical replacements among many others For example \n General Electric \n uses the high-end model to build parts for \n turbines \n Many of these systems are used for rapid prototyping before mass production methods are employed Higher education has proven to be a major buyer of desktop and professional 3D printers which industry experts generally view as a positive indicator \n Libraries around the world have also become locations to house smaller 3D printers for educational and community access \n Several projects and companies are making efforts to develop affordable 3D printers for home desktop use Much of this work has been driven by and targeted at \n DIY \n / \n Maker \n /enthusiast/ \n early adopter \n communities with additional ties to the academic and \n hacker \n communities \n Applications \n Applications of 3D printing \n The \n Audi RSQ \n was made with rapid prototyping industrial \n KUKA \n robots \n 3D printed human skull from computed computer tomography data \n 3D printed sculpture of the Egyptian Pharaoh \n Merankhre Mentuhotep \n shown at \n Threeding \n In the current scenario 3D printing or AM has been used in manufacturing medical industry and sociocultural sectors which facilitate 3D printing or AM to become successful commercial technology \n The earliest application of additive manufacturing was on the \n toolroom \n end of the manufacturing spectrum For example \n rapid prototyping \n was one of the earliest additive variants and its mission was to reduce the \n lead time \n and cost of developing prototypes of new parts and devices which was earlier only done with subtractive toolroom methods such as CNC milling turning and precision grinding \n In the 2010s additive manufacturing entered \n production \n to a much greater extent \n Additive manufacturing of food is being developed by squeezing out food layer by layer into three-dimensional objects A large variety of foods are appropriate candidates such as chocolate and candy and flat foods such as crackers pasta \n and pizza \n 3D printing has entered the world of clothing with fashion designers experimenting with 3D-printed \n bikinis \n shoes and dresses \n In commercial production Nike is using 3D printing to prototype and manufacture the Vapor Laser Talon football shoe for players of American football and New Balance is 3D manufacturing custom-fit shoes for athletes \n 3D printing has come to the point where companies are printing consumer grade eyewear with on-demand custom fit and styling although they cannot print the lenses On-demand customization of glasses is possible with rapid prototyping \n In cars trucks and aircraft AM is beginning to transform both \n unibody \n and \n fuselage \n design and production and \n powertrain \n design and production For example \n In early Swedish \n supercar \n manufacturer \n Koenigsegg \n announced the One a supercar that utilizes many components that were 3D printed \n Urbee \n is the name of the first car in the world car mounted using the technology 3D printing its bodywork and car windows were \"printed\" \n In \n Local Motors \n debuted Strati a functioning vehicle that was entirely 3D Printed using ABS plastic and carbon fiber except the powertrain \n In May Airbus announced that its new \n Airbus A350 XWB \n included over components manufactured by 3D printing \n In a \n Royal Air Force \n Eurofighter Typhoon \n fighter jet flew with printed parts The \n United States Air Force \n has begun to work with 3D printers and the \n Israeli Air Force \n has also purchased a 3D printer to print spare parts \n In \n GE Aviation \n revealed that it had used \n design for additive manufacturing \n to create a helicopter engine with parts instead of with great potential impact on reducing the complexity of \n supply chains \n AM's impact on firearms involves two dimensions new manufacturing methods for established companies and new possibilities for the making of \n do-it-yourself \n firearms In the US-based group \n Defense Distributed \n disclosed plans to design a working plastic \n 3D printed firearm \n \"that could be downloaded and reproduced by anybody with a 3D printer \" \n After Defense Distributed released their plans questions were raised regarding the effects that 3D printing and widespread consumer-level \n CNC \n machining \n may have on \n gun control \n effectiveness \n Surgical uses of 3D printing-centric therapies have a history beginning in the mid-1990s with anatomical modeling for bony reconstructive surgery planning \n Patient-matched implants were a natural extension of this work leading to truly personalized implants that fit one unique individual \n Virtual planning of surgery and guidance using 3D printed personalized instruments have been applied to many areas of surgery including total joint replacement and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction with great success \n clarification needed \n One example of this is the bioresorbable trachial splint to treat newborns with tracheobronchomalacia \n developed at the University of Michigan The use of additive manufacturing for serialized production of orthopedic implants metals is also increasing due to the ability to efficiently create porous surface structures that facilitate osseointegration The hearing aid and dental industries are expected to be the biggest area of future development using the custom 3D printing technology \n In March surgeons in Swansea used 3D printed parts to rebuild the face of a motorcyclist who had been seriously injured in a road accident \n As of \n update \n 3D \n bio-printing \n technology has been studied by \n biotechnology \n firms and academia for possible use in tissue engineering applications in which organs and body parts are built using inkjet techniques In this process layers of living cells are deposited onto a gel medium or sugar matrix and slowly built up to form three-dimensional structures including vascular systems \n Recently a heart-on-chip has been created which matches properties of cells \n In academic journals had begun to report on the possible artistic applications of 3D printing technology \n As of domestic 3D printing was mainly practiced by hobbyists and enthusiasts However little was used for practical household applications for example ornamental objects Some practical examples include a working clock \n and \n gears \n printed for home woodworking machines among other purposes \n Web sites associated with home 3D printing tended to include backscratchers coat hooks door knobs etc \n 3D printing and open source 3D printers in particular are the latest technology making inroads into the classroom \n Some authors have claimed that 3D printers offer an unprecedented \"revolution\" in \n STEM \n education \n The evidence for such claims comes from both the low cost ability for \n rapid prototyping \n in the classroom by students but also the fabrication of low-cost high-quality scientific equipment from \n open hardware \n designs forming \n open-source labs \n Future applications for 3D printing might include creating open-source scientific equipment \n In the last several years 3D printing has been intensively used by in the \n cultural heritage \n field for preservation restoration and dissemination purposes \n Many Europeans and North American Museums have purchased 3D printers and actively recreate missing pieces of their relics \n The \n Metropolitan Museum of Art \n and the \n British Museum \n have started using their 3D printers to create museum souvenirs that are available in the museum shops \n Other museums like the National Museum of Military History and Varna Historical Museum have gone further and sell through the online platform \n Threeding \n digital models of their artifacts created using \n Artec 3D \n scanners in 3D printing friendly file format which everyone can 3D print at home \n 3D printed soft \n actuators \n is a growing application of 3D printing technology which has found its place in the 3D printing applications These soft actuators are being developed to deal with soft structures and organs especially in biomedical sectors and where the interaction between human and robot is inevitable The majority of the existing soft actuators are fabricated by conventional methods that require manual fabrication of devices post processing/assembly and lengthy iterations until maturity in the fabrication is achieved To avoid the tedious and time-consuming aspects of the current fabrication processes researchers are exploring an appropriate manufacturing approach for effective fabrication of soft actuators Thus 3D printed soft actuators are introduced to revolutionise the design and fabrication of soft actuators with custom geometrical functional and control properties in a faster and inexpensive approach They also enable incorporation of all actuator components into a single structure eliminating the need to use external \n joints \n adhesives \n and \n fasteners \n Legal aspects \n Intellectual property \n Free hardware \n 3D printing has existed for decades within certain manufacturing industries where many legal regimes including \n patents \n industrial design rights \n copyright \n and \n trademark \n may apply However there is not much \n jurisprudence \n to say how these laws will apply if 3D printers become mainstream and individuals and hobbyist communities begin manufacturing items for personal use for non-profit distribution or for sale \n Any of the mentioned legal regimes may prohibit the distribution of the designs used in 3D printing or the distribution or sale of the printed item To be allowed to do these things where an active intellectual property was involved a person would have to contact the owner and ask for a licence which may come with conditions and a price However many patent design and copyright laws contain a standard limitation or exception for 'private' 'non-commercial' use of inventions designs or works of art protected under intellectual property IP That standard limitation or exception may leave such private non-commercial uses outside the scope of IP rights \n Patents cover inventions including processes machines manufactures and compositions of matter and have a finite duration which varies between countries but generally years from the date of application Therefore if a type of wheel is patented printing using or selling such a wheel could be an infringement of the patent \n Copyright covers an expression \n in a tangible fixed medium and often lasts for the life of the author plus 70years thereafter \n If someone makes a statue they may have copyright on the look of that statue so if someone sees that statue they cannot then distribute designs to print an identical or similar statue \n When a feature has both artistic copyrightable and functional patentable merits when the question has appeared in US court the courts have often held the feature is not copyrightable unless it can be separated from the functional aspects of the item \n In other countries the law and the courts may apply a different approach allowing for example the design of a useful device to be registered as a whole as an industrial design on the understanding that in case of unauthorized copying only the non-functional features may be claimed under design law whereas any technical features could only be claimed if covered by a valid patent \n Gun legislation and administration \n The US \n Department of Homeland Security \n and the \n Joint Regional Intelligence Center \n released a memo stating that \"significant advances in three-dimensional 3D printing capabilities availability of free digital 3D printable files for firearms components and difficulty regulating file sharing may present public safety risks from unqualified gun seekers who obtain or manufacture 3D printed guns \" and that \"proposed legislation to ban 3D printing of weapons may deter but cannot completely prevent their production Even if the practice is prohibited by new legislation online distribution of these 3D printable files will be as difficult to control as any other illegally traded music movie or software files \" \n Internationally where gun controls are generally stricter than in the United States some commentators have said the impact may be more strongly felt as alternative firearms are not as easily obtainable \n Officials in the United Kingdom have noted that producing a 3D printed gun would be illegal under their gun control laws \n Europol \n stated that criminals have access to other sources of weapons but noted that as the technology improved the risks of an effect would increase \n Downloads of the plans from the UK Germany Spain and Brazil were heavy \n Attempting to restrict the distribution over the Internet of gun plans has been likened to the futility of preventing the widespread distribution of \n DeCSS \n which enabled DVD \n ripping \n After the US government had Defense Distributed take down the plans they were still widely available via \n The Pirate Bay \n and other file sharing sites \n Some US legislators have proposed regulations on 3D printers to prevent them being used for printing guns \n 3D printing advocates have suggested that such regulations would be futile could cripple the 3D printing industry and could infringe on free speech rights with early pioneer of 3D printing Professor \n Hod Lipson \n suggesting that gunpowder could be controlled instead \n Health and safety \n Play media \n A video on research done on printer emissions \n Nanoparticle Safety \n A \n National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health \n NIOSH report noted particle emissions from a 3D printer peaked a few minutes after printing started and returned to baseline levels minutes after printing ended \n Emissions from 3D printers can include a large number of \n ultrafine particles \n and \n volatile organic compounds \n VOCs \n In desktop 3D printers potential health risks from emissions vary by filament type and color due to differences in size chemical properties and quantity of emitted particles Some of the chemical emissions have been linked to \n asthma \n The problem was reduced by using manufacturer-supplied covers and full enclosures using proper \n ventilation \n keeping workers away from the printer using \n respirators \n turning off the printer if it jammed and using lower emission printers and filaments \n At least one case of severe injury was noted from an explosion involved in metal powders used for 3D printing \n Impact \n Additive manufacturing starting with today's infancy period requires manufacturing firms to be flexible \n ever-improving \n users of all available technologies to remain competitive Advocates of additive manufacturing also predict that this arc of technological development will counter \n globalization \n as end users will do much of their own manufacturing rather than engage in trade to buy products from other people and corporations \n The real integration of the newer additive technologies into commercial production however is more a matter of complementing traditional subtractive methods rather than displacing them entirely \n The \n futurologist \n Jeremy Rifkin \n claimed that 3D printing signals the beginning of a \n third industrial revolution \n succeeding the \n production line \n assembly that dominated manufacturing starting in the late 19th century \n Social change \n Since the 1950s a number of writers and social commentators have speculated in some depth about the social and cultural changes that might result from the advent of commercially affordable additive manufacturing technology \n Amongst the more notable ideas to have emerged from these inquiries has been the suggestion that as more and more 3D printers start to enter people's homes the conventional relationship between the home and the workplace might get further eroded \n Likewise it has also been suggested that as it becomes easier for businesses to transmit designs for new objects around the globe so the need for high-speed freight services might also become less \n Finally given the ease with which certain objects can now be replicated it remains to be seen whether changes will be made to current copyright legislation so as to protect intellectual property rights with the new technology widely available \n As 3D printers became more accessible to consumers online social platforms have developed to support the community \n This includes websites that allow users to access information such as how to build a 3D printer as well as social forums that discuss how to improve 3D print quality and discuss 3D printing news as well as social media websites that are dedicated to share 3D models \n RepRap is a wiki based website that was created to hold all information on 3d printing and has developed into a community that aims to bring 3D printing to everyone Furthermore there are other sites such as \n Pinshape \n Thingiverse \n and \n MyMiniFactory \n which were created initially to allow users to post 3D files for anyone to print allowing for decreased transaction cost of sharing 3D files These websites have allowed greater social interaction between users creating communities dedicated to 3D printing \n Some call attention to the conjunction of \n Commons-based peer production \n with 3D printing and other low-cost manufacturing techniques \n The self-reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of economies of scope and here society can play an important role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customized productivity \n Further it is true that many issues problems and threats arise due to the democratization of the means of production and especially regarding the physical ones \n For instance the recyclability of advanced nanomaterials is still questioned weapons manufacturing could become easier not to mention the implications for counterfeiting \n and on IP \n It might be maintained that in contrast to the industrial paradigm whose competitive dynamics were about economies of scale \n Commons-based peer production \n 3D printing could develop economies of scope While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation the economies of scope share infrastructure costs intangible and tangible productive resources taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools \n And following Neil Gershenfeld \n in that \"some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most advanced technologies \" Commons-based peer production and 3D printing may offer the necessary tools for thinking globally but acting locally in response to certain needs \n Larry Summers \n wrote about the \"devastating consequences\" of 3D printing and other technologies robots artificial intelligence etc for those who perform routine tasks In his view \"already there are more American men on disability insurance than doing production work in manufacturing And the trends are all in the wrong direction particularly for the less skilled as the capacity of capital embodying artificial intelligence to replace white-collar as well as blue-collar work will increase rapidly in the years ahead \" Summers recommends more vigorous cooperative efforts to address the \"myriad devices\" e g tax havens bank secrecy money laundering and regulatory arbitrage enabling the holders of great wealth to \"avoid paying\" income and estate taxes and to make it more difficult to accumulate great fortunes without requiring \"great social contributions\" in return including more vigorous enforcement of anti-monopoly laws reductions in \"excessive\" protection for intellectual property greater encouragement of profit-sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements improvements in corporate governance strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity easing of land-use restrictions that may cause the real estate of the rich to keep rising in value better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers and increased public and private investment in infrastructure developmente g in energy production and transportation \n Michael Spence \n wrote that \"Now comes a powerful wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks This process of labor substitution and \n disintermediation \n has been underway for some time in service sectorsthink of ATMs online banking enterprise resource planning customer relationship management mobile payment systems and much more This revolution is spreading to the production of goods where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor \" In his view the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start in the design of hardware e g 3D printers and more important in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks \"Once this is achieved the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low and declines as scale rises and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing the incentives to invest in digital technologies are compelling \" Spence believes that unlike prior digital technologies which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies \"is cost reduction via the replacement of labor \" For example as the cost of 3D printing technology declines it is \"easy to imagine\" that production may become \"extremely\" local and customized Moreover production may occur in response to actual demand not anticipated or forecast demand Spence believes that labor no matter how inexpensive will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion with labor-intensive process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective and that re-localization will appear in both developed and developing countries In his view production will not disappear but it will be less labor-intensive and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion Spence writes that \"the world we are entering is one in which the most powerful global flows will be ideas and digital capital not goods services and traditional capital Adapting to this will require shifts in mindsets policies investments especially in human capital and quite possibly models of employment and distribution \" \n Design portal \n Book 3D printing \n 3D bioprinting \n 3D Manufacturing Format \n

replicating rapid prototyper \n As an \n open design \n all of the designs produced by the project are released under a \n free software license \n the \n GNU General Public License \n Due to the ability of the machine to make some of its own parts authors envisioned the possibility of cheap RepRap units enabling the manufacture of complex products without the need for extensive industrial infrastructure \n They intended for the RepRap to demonstrate \n evolution \n in this process as well as for it to increase in number exponentially \n A preliminary study claimed that using RepRaps to print common products results in economic savings \n Hardware \n Designs \n Software \n Replication materials \n Construction \n Project members \n Goals \n Education applications \n Notes \n RepRap building an object \n First part ever made by a RepRap to make a RepRap fabricated by the Zaphod prototype by Vik Olliver 2006/09/13 \n RepRap was founded in by Dr \n Adrian Bowyer \n a Senior Lecturer in \n mechanical engineering \n at the \n University of Bath \n in England Funding was obtained from the \n Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council \n On September the RepRap prototype successfully printed the first part of itself which were subsequently used to replace an identical part originally created by a commercial 3D printer On February RepRap \"Darwin\" successfully made at least one instance of over half its total rapid-prototyped parts On April possibly the first end-user item is made by a RepRap a clamp to hold an \n iPod \n securely to the dashboard of a \n Ford Fiesta \n By September of that year it was reported that at least copies have been produced in various countries \n In April electronic circuit boards were produced automatically with a RepRap using an automated control system and a swappable head system capable of printing both plastic and conductive solder On October the second generation design called \"Mendel\" printed its first part The Mendel's shape resembles a \n triangular prism \n rather than a cube RepRap \"Mendel\" was completed in October On January the \n Foresight Institute \n announced the \"Kartik M Gada Humanitarian Innovation Prize\" for the design and construction of an improved RepRap \n The third generation design \"Huxley\" was officially named on August Development is based on a miniaturized version of the Mendel hardware with 30% of the original print volume Within two years RepRap and \n RepStrap \n building and usage were widespread within the tech gadget and engineering communities \n In the first successful Delta design Rostock had a radically different design The latest iterations used \n OpenBeams \n wires typically Dyneema or Spectra fishing lines instead of belts and so forth which also represented some of the latest trends in RepRaps \n citation needed \n In early January RepRapPro short for \"RepRap Professional\" and one commercial arm of the RepRap project in the UK announced that they are to cease trading on January The reason given was congestion of the market for low-cost 3D printers and the inability to expand in that market RepRapPro China continues to operate \n Hardware \n As the project was designed by Dr Bowyer to encourage evolution many variations have been created \n As an \n open source \n project designers are free to make modifications and substitutions but they must reshare their improvements \n Designs \n There are many RepRap printer designs including \n Prusa i3 \n Hangprinter \n RepRap Fisher \n RepRap Snappy \n RepRap Morgan \n RepRap Ormerod \n RepRap Darwin \n RepRap Mendel \n Software \n Play media \n Adrian Bowyer talking about the RepRap Project at \n Poptech \n RepRap has been conceived as a complete replication system rather than simply a piece of hardware To this end the system includes \n computer-aided design \n CAD in the form of a \n 3D modeling \n system and \n computer-aided manufacturing \n CAM software and drivers that convert RepRap users' designs into a set of instructions to the RepRap hardware that turns them into physical objects \n Initially two different CAM toolchains had been developed for the RepRap The first simply titled \"RepRap Host\" was written in \n Java \n by lead RepRap developer Adrian Bowyer The second \" \n Skeinforge \n \" was written independently by Enrique Perez Both are complete systems for translating 3D computer models into \n G-code \n the machine language that commands the printer \n Later other programs like \n slic3r \n pronterface \n Cura \n were created Recently Franklin firmware \n was created to allow RepRap 3-D printers to be used as general purposes 3-D robots in addition to 3-D printing e g milling fluid handling etc \n The closed source \n KISSlicer \n and \n repetier host \n are also used \n Free and open-source 3-D modeling programs like \n Blender \n OpenSCAD \n and \n FreeCAD \n are preferred 3-D modeling programs in general for the RepRap community but virtually any CAD or 3D modeling program can be used with the RepRap as long as it is capable of producing \n STL \n files slic3r also supports \n obj \n and \n amf \n files Thus content creators make use of any tools they are familiar with whether they are commercial CAD programs such as \n SolidWorks \n and \n Autodesk AutoCAD \n Autodesk Inventor \n Autodesk 123D Design \n Tinkercad \n or \n Google Sketchup \n along with the libre software \n Replication materials \n Play media \n A timelapse video of a robot model logo of \n Make magazine \n being printed using FDM on a \n RepRap Fisher \n a delta-style printer \n RepRaps print objects from \n ABS \n Polylactic acid \n PLA \n Nylon \n possibly not all extruders capable \n HDPE \n TPE \n and similar \n thermoplastics \n Polylactic acid PLA has the engineering advantages of high stiffness minimal warping and an attractive translucent colour It is also biodegradable and plant-derived \n The mechanical properties of RepRap printed PLA and ABS have been tested and have been shown to be equivalent to the \n tensile strengths \n of proprietary printers \n Unlike in most commercial machines RepRap users are encouraged to experiment with printing new materials and methods and to publish their results Methods for printing novel materials such as ceramics have been developed this way In addition several \n RecycleBots \n have been designed and fabricated to convert waste plastic such as shampoo containers and milk jugs into inexpensive RepRap filament \n There is some evidence that using this approach of distributed recycling is better for the environment \n and can be useful for creating \" \n fair trade \n filament\" \n In addition 3D printing products themselves at the point of consumption by the consumer has also been shown to be better for the environment \n The RepRap project has identified \n polyvinyl alcohol \n PVA as a potentially suitable support material to complement its printing process although massive overhangs can be made with using thin layers of the primary printing media as support which are mechanically removed afterwards \n Printing electronics is a major goal of the RepRap project so that it can print its own circuit boards Several methods have been proposed \n Wood's metal \n or \n Field's metal \n low-melting point metal alloys to incorporate electrical circuits into the part as it is being formed \n Silver/carbon-filled polymers commonly used for repairs to circuit boards and are being contemplated for use for electrically conductive traces \n Direct extrusion of solder \n Conductive wires can be laid into a part from a spool during the printing process \n Using a \n MIG \n welder as a print head a RepRap \n deltabot \n stage can be used to print metals like \n steel \n The RepRap concept can also be applied to a milling machine \n and to \n laser welding \n Construction \n Although the aim of the project is for RepRap to be able to autonomously construct many of its own mechanical components in the near future using fairly low-level resources several components such as sensors stepper motors or \n microcontrollers \n are currently non-replicable using the RepRap's 3D printing technology and therefore have to be produced independently of the RepRap self-replicating process The goal is to \n asymptotically \n approach 100% replication over a series of evolutionary generations As one example from the onset of the project the RepRap team has explored a variety of approaches to integrating electrically-conductive media into the product The future success of this initiative should open the door to the inclusion of \n connective wiring \n printed circuit boards \n and possibly even \n motors \n in RepRapped products Variations in the nature of the extruded electrically-conductive media could produce electrical components with different functions from pure conductive traces not unlike what was done in the sprayed-circuit process of the 1940s named Electronic Circuit Making Equipment ECME described in the article on its designer \n John Sargrove \n Printed electronics \n is a related approach Another non-replicable component is the threaded rods for the linear motions A current research area is in using replicated \n Sarrus linkages \n to replace them \n Project members \n The \"Core team\" of the project \n has included \n Dr Adrian Bowyer Former Senior Lecturer Mechanical Engineering Department \n University of Bath \n Michael S Hart \n deceased creator of \n Project Gutenberg \n Illinois \n Goals \n Play media \n Video of RepRap printing an object \n The stated goal of the RepRap project is to produce a pure self-replicating device not for its own sake but rather to put in the hands of individuals anywhere on the planet for a minimal outlay of capital a \n desktop manufacturing \n system that would enable the individual to manufacture many of the artifacts used in everyday life \n From a theoretical viewpoint the project is attempting to prove the hypothesis that \" \n Rapid prototyping \n and direct writing technologies are sufficiently versatile to allow them to be used to make a \n von Neumann universal constructor \n \" \n Education applications \n RepRap technology has great potential in educational applications according to some scholars \n RepRaps have already been used for an educational mobile robotics platform \n Some authors have claimed that RepRaps offer an unprecedented \"revolution\" in \n STEM \n education \n The evidence for such claims comes from both the low cost ability for \n rapid prototyping \n in the classroom by students but also the fabrication of low-cost high-quality

also known as \n distributed production \n cloud producing \n and \n local manufacturing \n is a form of decentralized manufacturing practiced by enterprises using a network of geographically dispersed manufacturing facilities that are coordinated using \n information technology \n It can also refer to local manufacture via the historic \n cottage industry \n model or manufacturing that takes place in the homes of consumers \n Consumer \n Enterprise \n Social change \n Consumer \n Within the \n maker movement \n and \n DIY \n culture small scale production by consumers often using \n peer to peer \n resources is being referred to as distributed manufacturing Consumers download digital designs from an \n open design \n repository website like \n Youmagine \n or \n Thingiverse \n and produce a product for low costs through a distributed network of 3D printing services such as \n 3D Hubs \n or at home with an \n open-source 3-D printer \n such as the \n RepRap \n Distributed manufacturing with \n distributed generation \n using \n solar photovoltaic \n cells and \n 3-D printers \n has been proposed as a means for \n off-grid \n rural area residents to manufacture themselves out of \n poverty \n Recent advances in solar-powered 3-D printers have made manufacturing of a wide range of products possible in isolated communities \n An example of such an application are \n spectacles \n As Gwamuri et al point out that while it is \"still not yet feasible to print the lenses the most critical component of the eyeglasses \" and in current prototypes \"only the frames and syringe are printed\" and that \"aesthetics is another challenge\" the \"primary cost of the glasses could be reduced to about one dollar for a highly customized/individualized design which could be printed on site in under an hour\" presumably excluding the lenses and \"it seems clear that other products could benefit from the same approach and that distributed manufacturing can assist in sustainable development particularly in isolated rural regions\" \n Initial life cycle analysis indicates that distributed production can have a smaller impact on the environment than conventional manufacturing and shipping because of reductions in transportation embodied energy \n There are now several types of open-source solar-powered 3-D printers \n which can be used for production in \n off grid \n locations \n This can be taken to the extreme with \n RV \n owners using mobile \n 3-D printers \n to make fixtures for RV rooftops for solar \n photovoltaic \n panels \n Enterprise \n The primary attribute of distributed manufacturing is the ability to create value at geographically dispersed locations via manufacturing For example \n shipping \n costs are minimized when products are built geographically close to their intended markets Also products manufactured in a number of small facilities distributed over a wide area can be customized with details adapted to individual or regional tastes Manufacturing components in different physical locations and then managing the supply chain to bring them together for final assembly of a product is also considered a form of distributed manufacturing \n Digital networks combined with additive manufacturing allow companies a decentralized and geographically independent distributed production \n Cloud Producing \n Social change \n Some \n call attention to the conjunction of \n Commons-based peer production \n with distributed manufacturing techniques The self-reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of economies of scope and here the civil society can play an important role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customised productivity \n Further it is true that many issues problems and threats rise due to the large \n democratization \n of the means of production and especially regarding the physical ones \n For instance the recyclability of advanced nanomaterials is still questioned weapons manufacturing could become easier not to mention the implications on counterfeiting \n and on \" \n intellectual property \n \" \n It might be maintained that in contrast to the industrial paradigm whose competitive dynamics were about economies of scale \n Commons-based peer production \n and distributed manufacturing could develop economies of scope While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation the economies of scope share infrastructure costs intangible and tangible productive resources taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools \n And following \n Neil Gershenfeld \n in that some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most

On the term \n Hardware \n Licenses \n Development \n Open-source labs \n Open-source electronics \n Business models \n Reception and impact \n openhardware org logo \n OSHWA Logo \n The first hardware focused \" \n open source \n \" activities were started around by \n Bruce Perens \n creator of the \n Open Source Definition \n co-founder of the \n Open Source Initiative \n and a \n ham radio operator \n He launched the Open Hardware Certification Program which had the goal of allowing hardware manufacturers to self-certify their products as open \n Shortly after the launch of the Open Hardware Certification Program David Freeman announced the Open Hardware Specification Project OHSpec another attempt at licensing hardware components whose interfaces are available publicly and of creating an entirely new computing platform as an alternative to proprietary computing systems \n In early Sepehr Kiani Ryan Vallance and Samir Nayfeh joined efforts to apply the open source philosophy to machine design applications Together they established the Open Design Foundation ODF as a non-profit corporation and set out to develop an \n Open Design \n Definition But most of these activities faded out after a few years \n By the mid 2000s open source hardware again became a hub of activity due to the emergence of several major open source hardware projects and companies such as \n OpenCores \n RepRap \n 3D printing \n Arduino \n Adafruit \n and \n SparkFun \n In Perens reactivated the openhardware org website \n Following the \n Open Graphics Project \n an effort to design implement and manufacture a free and open 3D graphics chip set and reference graphics card Timothy Miller suggested the creation of an organization to safeguard the interests of the Open Graphics Project community Thus Patrick McNamara founded the \n Open Hardware Foundation \n OHF in \n The \n Tucson Amateur Packet Radio Corporation \n TAPR founded in as a non-profit organization of amateur radio operators with the goals of supporting R&D efforts in the area of amateur digital communications created in the first open hardware license the \n TAPR Open Hardware License \n The \n OSI \n president \n Eric S Raymond \n expressed some concerns about certain aspects of the OHL and decided to not review the license \n Around in context of the \n Freedom Defined \n project the Open Hardware Definition was created as collaborative work of many \n and is accepted as of by dozens of organizations and companies \n In July CERN \n European Organization for Nuclear Research \n released an open source hardware license \n CERN OHL \n Javier Serrano an engineer at CERNs Beams Department and the founder of the Open Hardware Repository explained \n By sharing designs openly CERN expects to improve the quality of designs through peer review and to guarantee their users including commercial companies the freedom to study modify and manufacture them leading to better hardware and less duplication of efforts \n While initially drafted to address CERN-specific concerns such as tracing the impact of the organizations research in its current form it can be used by anyone developing open source hardware \n Following the Open Hardware Summit and after heated debates on licenses and what constitutes open source hardware Bruce Perens abandoned the OSHW Definition and the concerted efforts of those involved with it \n Openhardware org led by Bruce Perens promotes and identifies practices that meet all the combined requirements of the Open Source Hardware Definition the Open Source Definition and the Four Freedoms of the \n Free Software Foundation \n Since openhardware org is not online and seems to have ceased activity \n The \n Open Source Hardware Association \n OSHWA at oshwa org proposes \n Open source hardware \n and acts as hub of open source hardware activity of all genres while cooperating with other entities such as TAPR CERN and OSI The OSHWA was established as an organization in June in Delaware and filed for tax exemption status in July \n After same debates about trademark interferences with the OSI in the OSHWA and the OSI signed a co-existence agreement \n In after years of skepticism on the relevance of \n free hardware designs \n the \n Free Software Foundation \n started the \" \n Respects Your Freedom \n \" RYF computer hardware product certification program It was intended to encourage the creation and sale of hardware that respects users' freedom and privacy and aims to ensure that users have control over their devices \n RYF certified laptops faced criticism on the basis of being slow and outdated hardware \n FSF's \n Replicant \n project suggested in an alternative \"free hardware\" definition derived from the \n FSF's four freedoms \n On the term \n Hardware \n The term \n hardware \n in open source hardware has been historically used in opposition to the term \n software \n of open source software That is to refer to the electronic hardware on which the software runs see previous section However as more and more non-electronic hardware products are made open source for example \n Wikihouse \n OpenBeam \n or \n Hovalin \n this term tends to be used back in its broader sense of \"physical product \" In that sense \n hardware \n refers to any form of tangible product may it be electronic hardware mechanical hardware textile or even construction hardware The Open Source Hardware OSHW Definition defines hardware as \"tangible artifacts machines devices or other physical things \" \n Licenses \n Rather than creating a new license some open-source hardware projects simply use existing \n free and open-source software \n licenses \n These licenses may not accord well with \n patent law \n Later several new licenses have been proposed designed to address issues specific to hardware designs \n In these licenses many of the fundamental principles expressed in open-source software OSS licenses have been \"ported\" to their counterpart hardware projects New \n hardware licenses \n are often explained as the \"hardware equivalent\" of a well-known OSS license such as the \n GPL \n LGPL \n or \n BSD license \n Despite superficial similarities to \n software licenses \n most hardware licenses are fundamentally different by nature they typically rely more heavily on \n patent \n law than on \n copyright \n law as many hardware designs are not copyrightable \n Whereas a copyright license may control the distribution of the source code or design documents a patent license may control the use and manufacturing of the physical device built from the design documents This distinction is explicitly mentioned in the preamble of the \n TAPR Open Hardware License \n \" those who benefit from an OHL design may not bring lawsuits claiming that design infringes their patents or other intellectual property \" \n TAPR Open Hardware License \n Noteworthy licenses include \n The \n TAPR Open Hardware License \n drafted by attorney \n John Ackermann \n reviewed by OSS community leaders \n Bruce Perens \n and \n Eric S Raymond \n and discussed by hundreds of volunteers in an open community discussion \n Balloon Open Hardware License \n used by all projects in the \n Balloon Project \n Although originally a software license \n OpenCores \n encourages the \n LGPL \n Hardware Design Public License written by \n Graham Seaman \n admin of Opencollector org \n In March \n CERN \n released the \n CERN Open Hardware License \n OHL \n intended for use with the Open Hardware Repository \n and other projects \n The Solderpad License \n is a version of the \n Apache License \n version amended by lawyer Andrew Katz to render it more appropriate for hardware use \n The \n Open Source Hardware Association \n recommends seven licenses which follow their \n open-source hardware definition \n From the general copyleft licenses the \n GNU General Public License \n GPL and \n Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike \n license from the HW specific copyleft licenses the \n CERN Open Hardware License \n OHL and \n TAPR Open Hardware License \n OHL and from the \n permissive licenses \n the \n FreeBSD license \n the \n MIT license \n and the \n Creative Commons Attribution \n license \n Openhardware org recommended in the TAPR Open Hardware License Creative Commons BY-SA and GPL license \n Organizations tend to rally around a shared license For example \n Opencores \n prefers the \n LGPL \n or a \n Modified BSD License \n FreeCores \n insists on the \n GPL \n Open Hardware Foundation \n promotes \" \n copyleft \n \" or other permissive licenses\" \n the \n Open Graphics Project \n uses a variety of licenses including the \n MIT license \n GPL \n and a proprietary license \n and the \n Balloon Project \n wrote their own license \n Development \n The OSHW Open Source Hardware logo \n silkscreened \n on an unpopulated \n PCB \n The \n Arduino \n Diecimila another popular and early open source hardware design \n Extensive discussion has taken place on ways to make open-source hardware as accessible as \n open-source software \n Discussions focus on multiple areas \n dead link \n such as the level at which open-source hardware is defined \n dead link \n ways to collaborate in hardware development as well as a model for \n sustainable development \n by making \n open-source appropriate technology \n In addition there has been considerable work to produce open-source hardware for scientific hardware using a combination of open-source electronics and \n 3-D printing \n One of the major differences between developing open-source software and developing open-source hardware is that hardware results in tangible outputs which cost money to prototype and manufacture As a result the phrase \"free as in speech not as in beer\" \n not in citation given \n more formally known as \n Gratis versus Libre \n distinguishes between the idea of zero cost and the freedom to use and modify information While open-source hardware faces challenges in minimizing cost and reducing financial risks for individual project developers some community members have proposed models to address these needs \n Given this there are initiatives to develop sustainable community funding mechanisms such as the Open Source Hardware Central Bank \n Often vendors of chips and other electronic components will sponsor contests with the provision that the participants and winners must share their designs \n Circuit Cellar \n magazine organizes some of these contests \n Open-source labs \n A guide has been published \n Open-Source Lab book \n by \n Joshua Pearce \n on using \n open-source electronics \n and \n 3D printing \n to make \n open-source labs \n Today scientists are creating many such labs examples include \n Boston Open Source Science Laboratory \n Somerville Massachusetts \n BYU Open Source Lab \n Brigham Young University \n Michigan Tech \n National Chiao Tung University \n OSU Open Source Lab \n Oregon State University \n Open Source Research Lab \n University of Texas \n at El Paso \n Open-source electronics \n One of the most popular types of open-source hardware is electronics There are numerous companies that provide large varieties of open-source electronics such as \n Sparkfun \n Adafruit \n and Seeed In addition there are \n NPOs \n and companies that provide a specific open-source electronic component such as the \n Arduino \n electronics prototyping platform There are numerous examples of speciality open-source electronics such as low-cost voltage and current GMAW open-source 3-D printer monitor \n and a robotics-assisted \n mass spectrometry \n assay platform \n Open-source electronics finds various uses including automation of chemical procedures \n Business models \n Open hardware companies are experimenting with different business models In one example \n littleBits \n implements open-source business models by making the design files available for the circuit designs in each littleBits module in accordance with the \n CERN Open Hardware License Version \n In another example \n Arduino \n has registered its name as a \n trademark \n Others may manufacture their designs but can't put the Arduino name on them Thus they can distinguish their products from others by appellation \n There are many applicable business models for implementing some open-source hardware even in traditional firms For example to accelerate development and technical innovation the \n photovoltaic \n industry has experimented with partnerships franchises secondary supplier and completely open-source models \n Recently many open source hardware projects were funded via \n crowdfunding \n on \n Indiegogo \n or \n Kickstarter \n Especially popular is \n Crowdsupply \n for crowdfunding open hardware projects \n Reception and impact \n Cover for \" \n Open-Source Lab \n \" by Joshua M Pearce \n Richard Stallman \n the founder of the \n Free Software \n movement was in skeptical on the idea and relevance of \n Free hardware \n his terminology what is now known

and certifications \n are voluntary usually third party-assessed norms and standards relating to environmental social ethical and food safety issues adopted by companies to demonstrate the performance of their organizations or products in specific areas There are perhaps up to such standards \n citation needed \n and the pace of introduction has increased in the last decade \n citation needed \n The trend started in the late 1980s and 90s with the introduction of \n Ecolabels \n and standards for \n Organic food \n and other products In recent years numerous standards have been established and adopted in the food industry in particular \n citation needed \n Most of them refer to the triple bottom line of environmental quality social equity and economic prosperity \n A standard is normally developed by a broad range of stakeholders and experts in a particular sector and includes a set of practices or criteria for how a crop should be sustainable grown or a resource should be ethically harvested This might cover for instance responsible fishing practices that don't endanger marine biodiversity or respect for human rights and the payment of fair wages on a coffee or tea plantation Normally sustainability standards are accompanied by a verification process - often referred to as \"certification\" - to evaluate that an enterprise complies with a standard as well as a traceability process for certified products to be sold along the supply chain often resulting in a consumer-facing label Certification programmes also focus on capacity building and working with partners and other organisations to support smallholders or disadvantaged producers to make the social and environmental improvements needed to meet the standard \n The basic premise of sustainability standards is twofold Firstly they emerged in areas where national and global legislation was weak but where the consumer and \n NGO \n movements around the globe demanded action For example campaigns by Global Exchange \n and other NGOs against the purchase of goods from \n sweatshop \n factories by the likes of \n Nike Inc \n Levi Strauss & Co \n and other leading brands led to the emergence of social welfare standards like the \n SA8000 \n and others Secondly leading brands selling to both consumers and to the \n B2B \n supply chain may wish to demonstrate the environmental or organic merits of their products which has led to the emergence of hundreds of ecolabels \n citation needed \n organic and other standards A leading example of a consumer standard is the \n Fairtrade \n movement administered by \n FLO International \n and exhibiting huge sales growth around the world for ethically sourced produce \n An example of a \n B2B \n standard which has grown tremendously in the last few years is the \n Forest Stewardship Council \n s standard FSC for forest products made from sustainable harvested trees \n However the line between consumer and B2B sustainability standards is becoming blurred with leading trade buyers increasingly demanding Fairtrade certification for example and consumers increasingly recognizing the FSC mark In recent years the business-to-business focus of sustainability standards has risen as it has become clear that consumer demand alone cannot drive the transformation of major sectors and industries \n citation needed \n In commodities such as palm oil soy farmed seafood and sugar certification initiatives are targeting the mainstream adoption of better practices and \n precompetitive \n industry collaboration Major brands and retailers are also starting to make commitments to certification in their whole supply chain or product offering rather than a single product line or ingredient \n citation needed \n With the growth of standards and certification as the major tool for global production and trade to become more sustainable and for the private sector to demonstrate sustainability leadership it is essential that there are ways to assess the legitimacy and performance of different initiatives Company and government buyers as well as NGOs and civil society groups committed to sustainable production need clarity on which standards and ecolabels are delivering \n real \n social environmental and economic results The \n ISEAL Alliance \n has emerged as the authority on good practice for sustainability standards and its Codes of Good Practice represent the most widely recognised guidance on how standards should be set up and implemented in order to be effective \n citation needed \n By complying with these Codes and working with other certification initiatives ISEAL members demonstrate their credibility and work towards improving their positive impacts \n Attempts to address the problems caused by a multiplicity of certification initiatives led to the launch of \n The State of Sustainability Initiatives SSI \n project facilitated by the \n United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \n UNCTAD and the \n International Institute for Sustainable Development \n IISD under the auspices of the Sustainable Commodity Initiative SCI \n citation needed \n Origin of global

examples \n Recommended readings \n Origin of global standards \n Most \n sustainability standards that are being adopted today were initiated by \n social movements \n in particular countries such as Rainforest Alliance in the United States and Fairtrade in the Netherlands \n citation needed \n Other standards were initiated by individual companies such as \n Utz Certified \n Ahold Starbucks C A F E Starbucks and Nespresso AAA Nespresso Some standards were launched by coalitions of private firms development agencies NGOs and other stakeholders For example the Common Code for the Coffee Community 4C was initiated by an alliance of large american coffee roasters including \n Kraft Foods \n Sara Lee \n and \n Nestle \n assisted by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development \n GIZ \n One important facilitator for the development of most global standards were series of local development projects involving NGOs coffee roasters and producers in different developing countries For example the Fairtrade standard was developed based on pilot projects with Mexican farmers 4C builds on development projects in Peru Colombia and Vietnam involving GIZ major coffee roasters and local producers \n The most widely established and adopted standards are in agriculture with 40% of global coffee production certified to one of the main schemes and approximately 15-20% of cocoa and tea production being compliant with major international standards Forestry and wild seafood are also sectors in which standards have been influential with certified production pushing past 10% of the global share Cotton palm oil soy biofuels and farmed seafood are some of the commodities in which certification is growing the fastest due in part to major roundtables that have been set up to bring the whole industry together More recently standards have started to emerge for mining and the extraction of metals - including gold silver aluminium and oil and gas - as well as for cattle electronics plastics and tourism \n Evidence suggests that Corporate Social Responsibility CSR adopted willingly by firms will be much more effective than government regulated CSR so global standards by private companies show promise for effective social impact \n The creation of the \n ISEAL Alliance \n in was the first collaborative effort amongst a group of sustainability standards organisations to agree to follow common good practices in how their standards are implemented and also to work together to drive up the use of standards and certification globally \n

Sharing and Acting Globally The use of mass collaboration in a business environment in recent history can be seen as an extension of the trend in business to \n outsource \n externalize formerly internal business functions to other business entities The difference however is that instead of an organized business body brought into being specifically for a unique function mass collaboration relies on free individual agents to come together and cooperate to improve a given operation or solve a problem This kind of outsourcing is also referred to as \n crowdsourcing \n to reflect this difference This can be incentivized by a reward system though it is not required \n The book also discusses seven new models of mass collaboration including \n Peering \n For example page \" \n Marketocracy \n employs a form of peering in a mutual fund \n Mutual fund \n MOFQX \n that harnesses the collective intelligence of the investment community Though not completely open source it is an example of how meritocratic peer-to-peer models are seeping into an industry where conventional wisdom favors the lone super-star stock advisor \" \n Ideagoras \n For example page linking experts with unsolved research and development problems The company \n InnoCentive \n is a consulting group that encapsulates the idea of ideagoras \n Prosumers \n For example page where it discusses the social

knowledge \n The last chapter is written by viewers and was opened for editing on February \n Central Concepts of Wikinomics in the Enterprise \n According to Tapscott and Williams these four principles are the central concepts of wikinomics in the enterprise \n Openness which includes not only open standards and content but also financial transparency and an open attitude towards external ideas and resources \n Peering which replaces hierarchical models with a more collaborative forum Tapscott and Williams cite the development of Linux as the \"quintessential example of peering \" \n Sharing which is a less proprietary approach to among other things products intellectual property bandwidth scientific knowledge \n Acting globally which involves embracing globalization and ignoring \"physical and geographical boundaries\" at both the corporate and individual level \n Coase's Law \n In the chapter \n The Perfect Storm \n the authors give an overview of the economic effects of the kind of transactions \n Web \n permits According to the authors \n Coase's Law \n see \n Ronald Coase \n governs the expansion of a business \n A firm will tend to expand until the cost of organizing an extra transaction within the firm become equal to the costs of carrying out the same transaction on the open market \n However because of the changing usage patterns of Internet technologies the cost of transactions has dropped so significantly that the authors assert that the market is better described by an inversion of Coase's Law That is \n A firm will tend to expand until the cost of carrying out an extra transaction on the open market become equal to the costs of organizing the same transaction within the firm \n Thus the authors think that with the costs of communicating dramatically dropping firms who do not change their current structures will perish Companies who utilize mass collaboration will dominate their respective markets \n Reception \n A review of this book in the \n Harvard Business Review \n states \"like its title the book's prose can fall into breathless hype \" \n A review of this book in \n Choice \n recommends the book for \"general readers and

\n Film \n Video games \n Comics \n Virtual reality communities \n Further reading \n In a pioneering paper the U S cognitive scientist \n Marvin Minsky \n attributed the development of the idea of telepresence to science fiction author \n Robert A Heinlein \n \"My first vision of a remote-controlled economy came from Robert A Heinlein's prophetic \n sic \n novel Waldo \" wrote Minsky In his science fiction short story \" \n Waldo \n \" Heinlein first proposed a primitive telepresence master-slave manipulator system \n The \n Brother Assassin \n written by \n Fred Saberhagen \n in introduced the complete concept for a telepresence master-slave humanoid system In the novel the concept is described as follows \"And a moment later it seemed to all his senses that he had been transported from the master down into the body of the slave-unit standing beneath it on the floor As the control of its movements passed over to him the slave started gradually to lean to one side and he moved its foot to maintain balance as naturally as he moved his own Tilting back his head he could look up through the slave's eyes to see the master-unit with himself inside maintaining the same attitude on its complex suspension \" \n The term \n telepresence \n was coined in a article by Minsky who outlined his vision for an adapted version of the older concept of \n teleoperation \n that focused on giving a remote participant a feeling of actually being present at a different location \n The first commercially successful telepresence company \n Teleport \n which was later renamed \n TeleSuite \n was founded in by David Allen and Herold Williams \n Before TeleSuite they ran a resort business from which the original concept emerged because they often found businesspeople would have to cut their stays short to participate in important meetings Their idea was to develop a technology that would allow businesspeople to attend their meetings without leaving the resorts so that they could lengthen their hotel stays \n A \n Tandberg E20 \n high resolution videoconferencing phone meant to replace conventional desktop phones \n Hilton Hotels \n had originally licensed to install them in their hotels throughout the United States and other countries but use was low The idea lost momentum with Hilton eventually backing out TeleSuite later began to focus less on the \n hospitality industry \n and more on business-oriented telepresence systems Shareholders eventually held enough stock to replace the company's original leadership which ultimately led to its collapse \n citation needed \n David Allen purchased all of the assets of TeleSuite and appointed Scott Allen as president \n of the new company called \n Destiny Conferencing \n Destiny Conferencing licensed its patent portfolio to \n HP \n which became the first large company to join the telepresence industry soon followed by others such as \n Cisco \n and \n Polycom \n After forming a distribution agreement with Pleasanton-based Polycom Destiny Conferencing sold on January to \n Polycom \n for $60 million \n An important research project in telepresence began in Located at the \n University of Toronto \n the Ontario Telepresence Project OTP was an interdisciplinary effort involving social sciences and engineering Its final report stated that it \" was a three year $4 million pre-competitive research project whose mandate was to design and field trial advanced \n media space \n systems in a variety of workplaces in order to gain insights into key sociological and engineering issues The OTP which ended in December was part of the International Telepresence Project which linked Ontario researchers to their counterparts in four European nations The Projects major sponsor was the \n Province of Ontario \n through two of its Centres of Excellencethe Information Technology Research Centre ITRC and the Telecommunications Research Institute of Ontario TRIO \" \n History of

telepresence We wanted to reduce our travel spend reduce our carbon footprint and environmental impact improve our employees' work/life balance and improve employee productivity \" \n American exile Edward Snowden participates in a TED talk in Texas from Russia via telepresence robot March \n Rather than \n traveling \n great distances in order to have a face-face meeting it is now commonplace to instead use a telepresence system which uses a multiple codec video system which is what the word \"telepresence\" most currently represents Each member/party of the meeting uses a telepresence room to \"dial in\" and can see/talk to every other member on a \n screen \n /screens as if they were in the same room This brings enormous time and cost benefits It is also superior to phone conferencing except in cost as the visual aspect greatly enhances communications allowing for perceptions of facial expressions and other body language \n Mobile collaboration \n systems combine the use of video audio and on-screen drawing capabilities using newest generation hand-held mobile devices to enable multi-party conferencing in real-time independent of location Benefits include cost-efficiencies resulting from accelerated problem resolution reductions in downtimes and travel improvements in customer service and increased productivity \n Implementation \n Telepresence has been described as the human experience of being fully present at a live real-world location remote from one's own physical location Someone experiencing video telepresence would therefore be able to behave and receive stimuli as though part of a meeting at the remote site The aforementioned would result in interactive participation of group activities that would bring benefits to a wide range of users \n Implementation of human sensory elements \n To provide a telepresence experience technologies are required that implement the human sensory elements of vision sound and manipulation \n Vision and sound \n A minimum system usually includes visual \n feedback \n Ideally the entire \n field of view \n of the user is filled with a view of the remote location and the viewpoint corresponds to the movement and orientation of the user's head In this way it differs from \n television \n or \n cinema \n where the viewpoint is out of the control of the viewer \n In order to achieve this the user may be provided with either a very large or wraparound screen or \n small displays \n mounted directly in front of the eyes The latter provides a particularly convincing \n 3D \n sensation The movements of the user's head must be sensed and the \n camera \n must mimic those movements accurately and in real time This is important to prevent unintended motion sickness \n Another source of future improvement to telepresence displays compared by some to \n holograms \n is a projected \n display technology \n featuring life-sized imagery \n Sound is generally the easiest sensation to implement with high \n fidelity \n based on the foundational \n telephone \n technology dating back more than years Very high-fidelity sound equipment has also been available for a considerable period of time with \n stereophonic sound \n being more convincing than \n monaural \n sound \n Manipulation \n Monty a telemanipulation prototype from \n Anybots \n The ability to manipulate a remote object or environment is an important aspect for some telepresence users and can be implemented in large number of ways depending on the needs of the user Typically the movements of the user's hands position in space and posture of the fingers are sensed by \n wired gloves \n inertial sensors \n or absolute spatial position sensors A \n robot \n in the remote location then copies those movements as closely as possible This ability is also known as \n teleoperation \n The more closely the robot re-creates the form factor of the human hand the greater the sense of telepresence Complexity of robotic effectors varies greatly from simple one axis grippers to \n fully anthropomorphic robot hands \n Haptic \n teleoperation refers to a system that provides some sort of tactile force feedback to the user so the user feels some approximation of the weight firmness size and/or texture of the remote objects manipulated by the robot \n Freedom of movement \n iRobot Ava an autonomous roaming telepresence robot \n The prevalence of high quality video conferencing using mobile devices tablets and portable computers has enabled a drastic growth in telepresence robots to help give a better sense of remote physical presence for communication and collaboration in the office home or school when one cannot be there in person The robot avatar can move or look around at the command of the remote person Drivable telepresence robots typically contain a display integrated or separate phone or tablet mounted on a roaming base Some examples of roaming telepresence robots include Beam by Suitable Technologies Double by Double Robotics RP-Vita by iRobot Anybots Vgo TeleMe by Mantarobot and Romo by Romotive \n More modern roaming telepresence robots may include an ability to operate \n autonomously \n The robots can map out the space and be able to avoid obstacles while driving themselves between rooms and their docking stations \n Effectiveness \n Telepresence's effectiveness varies by degree of fidelity Research has noted that telepresence solutions differ in degree of implementation from \"immersive\" through \"adaptive\" to \"lite\" solutions \n At the top are immersive solutions where the environments at both ends are highly controlled and often the same with respect to lighting acoustics decor and furniture thereby giving all the participants the impression they are together at the same table in the same room thus engendering the \"immersive\" label \n Adaptive telepresence solutions may use the same technology but the environments at both ends are not highly controlled and hence often differ Adaptive solutions differ from telepresence lite solutions not in terms of control of environments but in terms of integration of technology Adaptive solutions use a managed service whereas telepresence lite solutions use components that someone must integrate \n Transparency of implementation \n A telepresence conference between Ghana Africa and Newark N J in \n A good telepresence strategy puts the human factors first focusing on visual collaboration configurations that closely replicate the brain's innate preferences for interpersonal communications separating from the unnatural \"talking heads\" experience of traditional videoconferencing These cues include lifesize participants fluid motion accurate flesh tones and the appearance of true eye contact \n This is already a well-established technology used by many businesses today The chief executive officer of \n Cisco Systems \n John Chambers \n in June at the Networkers Conference compared telepresence to \n teleporting \n from \n Star Trek \n and said that he saw the technology as a potential billion dollar market for Cisco \n Rarely will a telepresence system provide such a transparent implementation with such comprehensive and convincing stimuli that the user perceives no differences from actual presence But the user may set aside such differences depending on the application \n The fairly simple \n telephone \n achieves a limited form of telepresence using just the human sensory element of hearing in that users consider themselves to be \n talking to each other \n rather than talking to the telephone itself \n Watching \n television \n for example although it stimulates our primary senses of \n vision \n and \n hearing \n rarely gives the impression that the watcher is no longer at home However television sometimes engages the senses sufficiently to trigger emotional responses from viewers somewhat like those experienced by people who directly witness or experience events Televised depictions of sports events or disasters such as the \n September terrorist attacks \n can elicit strong emotions from viewers \n As the screen size increases so does the sense of immersion as well as the range of subjective mental experiences available to viewers Some viewers have \n reported \n a sensation of genuine \n vertigo \n or \n motion sickness \n while watching \n IMAX \n movies of flying or outdoor sequences \n Because most currently feasible telepresence gear leaves something to be desired the user must \n suspend disbelief \n to some degree and choose to act in a natural way appropriate to the remote location perhaps using some skill to operate the equipment In contrast a telephone user does not see herself as \"operating\" the telephone but merely talking to another person with it \n Related technologies \n Virtual presence virtual reality \n An Online Video Web Conference in an Office \n Telepresence \n refers to a user interacting with another live real place and is distinct from \n virtual presence \n where the user is given the impression of being in a simulated environment Telepresence and virtual presence rely on similar user-interface equipment and they share the common feature that the relevant portions of the user's experience at some point in the process will be transmitted in an abstract usually \n digital \n representation The main functional difference is the entity on the other end a real environment in the case of telepresence vs a \n computer \n in the case of \n immersive virtual reality \n The cooperative web \n The \n Cooperative web \n or Co-Web refers to a browser-based platform that promises to replicate the power of face-to-face communications via web-touch without sacrificing the quality of human interactions using the human sensory elements of vision sound and manipulation \n Applications \n Application examples could be cited within emergency management and security services B&I and the entertainment and education industries \n Connecting communities \n Telepresence can be used to establish a sense of shared presence or shared space among geographically separated members of a group \n citation needed \n Hazardous environments \n Robonaut \n aboard the \n International Space Station \n Many other applications in situations where humans are exposed to hazardous situations are readily recognised as suitable candidates for telepresence Mining bomb disposal military operations rescue of victims from fire toxic atmospheres deep sea exploration or even hostage situations are some examples Telepresence also plays a critical role in the exploration of other worlds such as with the \n Mars Exploration Rovers \n which are teleoperated from Earth \n Pipeline inspection \n Small diameter pipes otherwise inaccessible for examination can now be viewed using \n pipeline video inspection \n Remote surgery \n The possibility of being able to project the knowledge and the physical skill of a surgeon over long distances has many attractions Thus again there is considerable research underway in the subject Locally controlled robots are currently being used for joint replacement surgery as they are more precise in milling bone to receive the joints The armed forces have an obvious interest since the combination of telepresence \n teleoperation \n and \n telerobotics \n can potentially save the lives of battle casualties by allowing them prompt attention in mobile operating theatres by remote surgeons \n Recently \n teleconferencing \n has been used in medicine telemedicine or telematics mainly employing audio-visual exchange for the performance of real time remote surgical operations as demonstrated in Regensburg Germany in \n In addition to audio-visual data the transfer of haptic tactile information has also been demonstrated in telemedicine \n Education \n A professional development expert in Denver uses telepresence to coach a teacher in Utah during the initial research of Project ThereNow \n Research has been conducted on the use of telepresence to provide professional development to teachers Research has shown that one of the most effective forms of teacher professional development is coaching or \n cognitive apprenticeship \n The application of telepresence shows promise for making this approach to teacher professional development practical \n The benefits of enabling schoolchildren to take an active part in exploration have also been shown by the JASON and the \n NASA \n Ames Research Center \n programs The ability of a pupil student or researcher to explore an otherwise inaccessible location is a very attractive proposition For example locations where the passage of too many people is harming the immediate environment or the artifacts themselves e g undersea exploration of coral reefs ancient Egyptian tombs and more recent works of art \n Another application is for remote classroom which allows a professor to interact with students in multiple campuses to teach the same class simultaneously An example of this application is in classrooms of the law schools of \n Rutgers University \n Two identical rooms are located in two \n metropolitan areas \n Each classroom is equipped with \n studio lighting \n audio and video conference equipment connected to a 200-inch monitor on the wall that students face to give an impression that they are all in the same classroom This allows professors to be on either campus and facilitates the interaction among students in both campuses during the classes \n Telepresence art \n True telepresence is a multidisciplinary art and science that foundationally integrates \n engineering \n psychology \n and the art of television broadcast \n In Diller and Scofidio created the \"Refresh\" an Internet-based art installation that juxtaposed a live web camera with recorded videos staged by professional actors Each image was accompanied with a fictional narrative which made it difficult to distinguish which was the live web camera \n A soap opera for iMacs \n In \n Eduardo Kac \n and Ed Bennett created a telepresence installation \"Ornitorrinco on the Moon\" for the international telecommunication arts festival \"Blurred Boundaries\" Entgrenzte Grenzen II It was coordinated by Kulturdata in Graz Austria and was connected around the world \n From to the present \n Ghislaine Boddington \n of shinkansen and \n body>data>space \n has explored in a collaboration process she has called The Weave \n using performing arts techniques the extended use of telepresence into festivals arts centres and clubs and has directed numerous workshops leading to exploration of telepresence by many artists worldwide

\n or \n Information management \n Knowledge management \n KM \n is the process of creating sharing using and managing the \n knowledge \n and information of an organisation \n It refers to a multidisciplinary approach to achieving organisational objectives by making the best use of knowledge \n An established \n discipline \n since KM includes courses taught in the fields of \n business administration \n information systems \n management library and \n information sciences \n Other fields may contribute to KM research including information and media \n computer science \n public health \n and \n public policy \n Several universities offer dedicated \n master's degrees \n in knowledge management \n Many large companies public institutions and non-profit organisations have resources dedicated to internal KM efforts often as a part of their \n business strategy \n IT \n or \n human resource management \n departments \n Several consulting companies provide advice regarding KM to these organisations \n Knowledge management efforts typically focus on organisational objectives such as improved performance \n competitive advantage \n innovation \n the sharing of lessons learned integration and \n continuous improvement \n of the organisation \n These efforts overlap with \n organisational learning \n and may be distinguished from that by a greater focus on the management of knowledge as a strategic asset and on encouraging the \n sharing of knowledge \n KM is an enabler of organisational learning \n Research \n Dimensions \n Strategies \n Motivations \n KM technologies \n Knowledge management efforts have a long history including on-the-job discussions formal \n apprenticeship \n discussion forums \n corporate libraries professional training and mentoring programs \n With increased use of computers in the second half of the 20th century specific \n adaptations \n of technologies such as \n knowledge bases \n expert systems \n information repositories \n group \n decision support systems \n intranets \n and \n computer-supported cooperative work \n have been introduced to further enhance such efforts \n In the term \n personal knowledge management \n was introduced it refers to the management of knowledge at the individual level \n In the enterprise early collections of case studies recognised the importance of knowledge management dimensions of strategy \n process \n and \n measurement \n Key lessons learned include people and the cultural norms which influence their behaviors are the most critical resources for successful knowledge creation dissemination and application cognitive social and organisational learning processes are essential to the success of a knowledge management strategy and measurement \n benchmarking \n and incentives are essential to accelerate the learning process and to drive cultural change \n In short knowledge management programs can yield impressive benefits to individuals and organisations if they are purposeful concrete and action-orientated \n Research \n KM emerged as a scientific discipline in the early 1990s \n It was initially supported by individual practitioners when \n Skandia \n hired Leif Edvinsson of Sweden as the world's first \n Chief Knowledge Officer \n CKO \n Hubert Saint-Onge formerly of \n CIBC \n Canada started investigating KM long before that \n The objective of CKOs is to manage and maximise the intangible assets of their organisations \n Gradually CKOs became interested in practical and theoretical aspects of KM and the new research field was formed \n The KM idea has been taken up by academics such as \n Ikujiro Nonaka \n Hitotsubashi University \n Hirotaka Takeuchi Hitotsubashi University \n Thomas H Davenport \n Babson College \n and Baruch Lev \n New York University \n In \n Thomas A Stewart \n former editor at \n Fortune \n magazine and subsequently the editor of \n Harvard Business Review \n published a cover story highlighting the importance of intellectual capital in organisations \n The KM discipline has been gradually moving towards academic maturity \n First is a trend toward higher cooperation among academics single-author publications are less common Second the role of practitioners has changed \n Their contribution to academic research declined from 30% of overall contributions up to to only 10% by \n Multiple KM disciplines exist approaches vary by author and school \n As the discipline matured academic debates increased regarding \n theory \n and practice including \n Techno-centric \n with a focus on technology ideally those that enhance \n knowledge sharing \n and creation \n Organisational \n with a focus on how an organisation can be designed to facilitate knowledge processes best \n Ecological \n with a focus on the interaction of people \n identity \n knowledge and environmental factors as a \n complex adaptive system \n akin to a natural \n ecosystem \n Regardless of the \n school of thought \n core components of KM roughly include people/culture processes/structure and technology The details depend on the \n perspective \n KM perspectives include \n community of practice \n social network analysis \n intellectual capital \n information theory \n complexity science \n constructivism \n The practical relevance of academic research in KM has been questioned \n with \n action research \n suggested as having more relevance \n and the need to translate the findings presented in academic journals to a practice \n Dimensions \n Different \n frameworks \n for distinguishing between different 'types of' knowledge exist \n One proposed framework for categorizing the \n dimensions \n of knowledge distinguishes \n tacit knowledge \n and \n explicit knowledge \n Tacit knowledge represents internalised knowledge that an individual may not be consciously aware of such as to accomplish particular tasks At the opposite end of the spectrum explicit knowledge represents knowledge that the individual holds consciously in mental focus in a form that can easily be communicated to others \n The Knowledge Spiral as described by Nonaka & Takeuchi \n Ikujiro Nonaka proposed a model \n SECI \n for Socialization Externalization Combination Internalization which considers a spiraling interaction between \n explicit knowledge \n and tacit knowledge \n In this model knowledge follows a cycle in which implicit knowledge is 'extracted' to become explicit knowledge and explicit knowledge is 're-internalised' into implicit knowledge \n Hayes and Walsham describe knowledge and knowledge management as two different perspectives \n The content perspective suggests that knowledge is easily stored because it may be codified while the relational perspective recognises the contextual and relational aspects of knowledge which can make knowledge difficult to share outside of the specific context in which it is developed \n Early research suggested that KM needs to convert internalised tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge to share it and the same effort must permit individuals to internalise and make personally meaningful any codified knowledge retrieved from the KM effort \n Subsequent research suggested that a distinction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge represented an oversimplification and that the notion of explicit knowledge is self-contradictory \n Specifically for knowledge to be made explicit it must be translated into information i e \n symbols \n outside of our heads \n More recently together with \n Georg von Krogh \n and \n Sven Voelpel \n Nonaka returned to his earlier work in an attempt to move the debate about knowledge conversion forward \n A second proposed framework for categorizing knowledge dimensions distinguishes embedded knowledge of a \n system \n outside of a human individual e g an information system may have knowledge embedded into its design from \n embodied knowledge \n representing a learned capability of a human body's \n nervous \n and \n endocrine systems \n A third proposed framework distinguishes between the exploratory creation of \"new knowledge\" i e innovation vs the \n transfer \n or exploitation of \"established knowledge\" within a group organisation or community \n Collaborative environments such as communities of practice or the use of \n social computing \n tools can be used for both knowledge creation and transfer \n Strategies \n Knowledge may be accessed at three stages before during or after KM-related activities \n Organisations have tried knowledge capture \n incentives \n including making content submission mandatory and incorporating rewards into \n performance measurement \n plans \n Considerable controversy exists over whether such incentives work and no consensus has emerged \n One strategy to KM involves actively managing knowledge push strategy \n In such an instance individuals strive to explicitly encode their knowledge into a shared knowledge repository such as a \n database \n as well as retrieving knowledge they need that other individuals have provided codification \n Another strategy involves individuals making knowledge requests of experts associated with a particular subject on an ad hoc basis pull strategy \n In such an instance expert individual s provide \n insights \n to requestor personalisation \n Hansen et al defined the two strategies \n Codification focuses on collecting and storing codified knowledge in electronic databases to make it accessible \n Codification can therefore refer to both tacit and explicit knowledge \n In contrast personalization encourages individuals to share their knowledge directly \n Information technology plays a less important role as it is only facilitates communication and knowledge sharing \n Other knowledge management strategies and instruments for companies include \n Knowledge sharing fostering a culture that encourages the sharing of information based on the concept that knowledge is not irrevocable and should be shared and updated to remain relevant \n Storytelling \n as a means of transferring tacit knowledge \n Cross-project learning \n Make knowledge-sharing as a key roles in employees' job description \n After-action reviews \n Knowledge mapping a map of knowledge repositories within a company accessible

ideological \n movement and its manifestations encompassing \n technological \n choice and application that is small-scale \n decentralized \n labor-intensive \n energy-efficient \n environmentally sound \n and \n locally autonomous \n It was originally articulated as \n intermediate technology \n by the economist \n Dr Ernst Friedrich \"Fritz\" Schumacher \n in his work \n Small is Beautiful \n Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasize the technology as people-centered \n Appropriate technology has been used to address issues in a wide range of fields Well-known examples of appropriate technology applications include bike- and hand-powered water pumps and other \n self-powered equipment \n the \n universal nut sheller \n self-contained \n solar lamps \n and \n streetlights \n and \n passive solar building designs \n Today appropriate technology is often developed using \n open source \n principles which have led to \n open-source appropriate technology \n OSAT and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the \n Internet \n OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling \n innovation \n for \n sustainable development \n Appropriate technology is most commonly discussed in its relationship to \n economic development \n and as an alternative to \n technology transfer \n of more \n capital \n -intensive technology from \n industrialized nations \n to \n developing countries \n However appropriate technology movements can be found in both developing and developed countries In developed countries the appropriate technology movement grew out of the \n energy crisis of the 1970s \n and focuses mainly on environmental and \n sustainability \n issues \n Today the idea is multifaceted in some contexts appropriate technology can be described as the simplest level of technology that can achieve the intended purpose whereas in others it can refer to engineering that takes adequate consideration of social and environmental ramifications The facets are connected through \n robustness \n and \n sustainable living \n Background \n Predecessors \n E F Schumacher \n Growing trend \n

\n Related social movements \n Further reading \n Background \n History of technology the development over time of systematic techniques for making and doing things The term technology a combination of the Greek techn \"art craft\" with logos \"word speech\" meant in Greece a discourse on the arts both fine and \n applied \n When it first appeared in English in the 17th century it was used to mean a discussion of the applied arts only and gradually these \"arts\" themselves came to be the object of the designation By the early 20th century the term embraced a growing range of means processes and ideas in addition to tools and machines By mid-century technology was defined by such phrases as \"the means or activity by which man seeks to change or manipulate his environment \" Even such broad definitions have been criticized by observers who point out the increasing difficulty of distinguishing between scientific inquiry and technological activity \n A highly compressed account of the history of technology such as this one must adopt a rigorous methodological pattern if it is to do justice to the subject without grossly distorting it one way or another The plan followed in the present article is primarily chronological tracing the development of technology through phases that succeed each other in time Obviously the division between phases is to a large extent arbitrary One factor in the weighting has been the enormous acceleration of Western technological development in recent centuries Eastern technology is considered in this article in the main only as it relates to the development of modern technology \n Predecessors \n Indian ideological leader \n Mahatma Gandhi \n is often cited as the \"father\" of the appropriate technology movement Though the concept had not been given a name Gandhi advocated for small local and predominantly village-based technology to help India's villages become self-reliant He disagreed with the idea of technology that benefited a minority of people at the expense of the majority or that put people out of work to increase profit \n In Gandhi founded the All-India Spinners Association and in he retired from politics to form the All-India Village Industries Association Both organizations focused on village-based technology similar to the future appropriate technology movement \n China also implemented policies similar to appropriate technology during the reign of \n Mao Zedong \n and the following \n Cultural Revolution \n During the Cultural Revolution development policies based on the idea of \"walking on two legs\" advocated the development of both large-scale factories and small-scale village industries \n E F Schumacher \n Despite these early examples \n Dr Ernst Friedrich \"Fritz\" Schumacher \n is credited as the founder of the appropriate technology movement A well-known economist Schumacher worked for the British National Coal Board for more than years where he blamed the size of the industry's operations for its uncaring response to the harm \n black-lung disease \n inflicted on the miners \n However it was his work with developing countries such as \n India \n and \n Burma \n which helped Schumacher form the underlying principles of appropriate technology \n Schumacher first articulated the idea of \"intermediate technology \" now known as appropriate technology in a report to the Indian Planning Commission in which he described India as long in labor and short in capital calling for an \"intermediate industrial technology\" \n that harnessed India's labor surplus Schumacher had been developing the idea of intermediate technology for several years prior to the Planning Commission report In following a stint as an economic advisor to the government of Burma he published the short paper \"Economics in a Buddhist Country \" his first known critique of the effects of Western economics on developing countries \n In addition to Buddhism Schumacher also credited his ideas to Gandhi \n Initially Schumacher's ideas were rejected by both the Indian government and leading development economists Spurred to action over concern the idea of intermediate technology would languish Schumacher George McRobie \n Mansur Hoda \n and Julia Porter brought together a group of approximately people to form the \n Intermediate Technology Development Group \n ITDG in May Later that year a Schumacher article published in the \n Observer \n garnered significant attention and support for the group In the group published the \n Tools for Progress A Guide to Small-scale Equipment for Rural Development \n and sold copies ITDG also formed panels of experts and practitioners around specific technological needs such as building construction energy and water to develop intermediate technologies to address those needs \n At a conference hosted by the ITDG in the term \"intermediate technology\" was discarded in favor of the term \"appropriate technology\" used today Intermediate technology had been criticized as suggesting the technology was inferior to advanced or high technology and not including the social and political factors included in the concept put forth by the proponents \n In Schumacher described the concept of appropriate technology to a mass audience in his influential work \n Small is Beautiful Economics as if People Mattered \n Growing trend \n The \n Universal Nut Sheller \n in use in Uganda an example of appropriate technology \n Between and the number of new appropriate technology organizations founded each year was three times greater than the previous nine years There was also an increase in organizations focusing on applying appropriate technology to the problems of industrialized nations particularly issues related to energy and the environment \n In the OECD identified in its \n Appropriate Technology Directory \n organizations involved in the development and promotion of appropriate technology By this number had grown to more than International agencies and government departments were also emerging as major innovators in appropriate technology indicating its progression from a small movement fighting against the established norms to a legitimate technological choice supported by the establishment For example the \n Inter-American Development Bank \n created a Committee for the Application of Intermediate Technology in and the \n World Health Organization \n established the Appropriate Technology for Health Program in \n Appropriate technology was also increasingly applied in developed countries For example the energy crisis of the mid-1970s led to the creation of the \n National Center for Appropriate Technology \n NCAT in with an initial appropriation of million dollars from the U S Congress The Center sponsored appropriate technology demonstrations to \"help low-income communities find better ways to do things that will improve the quality of life and that will be doable with the skills and resources at hand \" However by the NCAT's funding agency Community Services Administration had been abolished For several decades NCAT worked with the US departments of Energy and Agriculture on contract to develop appropriate technology programs Since NCAT's informational web site is no longer funded by the US government \n Decline \n In more recent years the appropriate technology movement has continued to decline in prominence Germany's German Appropriate Technology Exchange GATE and Holland's Technology Transfer for Development TOOL are examples of organizations no longer in operation Recently a study looked at the continued barriers to AT deployment despite the relatively low cost of transferring information in the internet age The barriers have been identified as AT seen as inferior or \"poor person's\" technology technical transferability and robustness of AT insufficient funding weak institutional support and the challenges of distance and time in tackling rural poverty \n A more \n free market \n -centric view has also begun to dominate the field For example \n Paul Polak \n founder of \n International Development Enterprises \n an organization that designs and manufactures products that follow the ideals of appropriate technology declared appropriate technology dead in a blog post \n Polak argues the \" \n design for the other percent \n \" movement has replaced appropriate technology Growing out of the appropriate technology movement designing for the other percent advocates the creation of low-cost solutions for the billion of the world's billion population \"who have little or no access to most of the products and services many of us take for granted \" \n Many of the ideas integral to appropriate technology can now be found in the increasingly popular \" \n sustainable development \n \" movement which among many tenets advocates technological choice that meets human needs while preserving the environment for future \n generations \n In the OECD published the results of an extensive survey of appropriate technology organizations titled \n The World of Appropriate Technology \n in which it defined appropriate technology as characterized by \"low investment cost per work-place low capital investment per unit of output organizational simplicity high adaptability to a particular social or cultural environment sparing use of natural resources low cost of final product or high potential for employment \" \n Today the OECD web site redirects from the \"Glossary of Statistical Terms\" entry on \"appropriate technology\" to \"environmentally sound technologies \" \n The United Nations' \"Index to Economic and Social Development\" also redirects from the \"appropriate technology\" entry to \"sustainable development \" \n Potential resurgence \n Despite the decline several appropriate technology organizations are still in existence including the ITDG which became \n Practical Action \n after a name change in \n Skat \n Schwierzerische Kontaktstelle fr Angepasste Technology adapted by becoming a private consultancy in though some Intermediate Technology activities are continued by \n Skat Foundation \n through the \n Rural Water Supply Network RWSN \n Another actor still very active is the charity \n CEAS Centre Ecologique Albert Schweitzer \n Pioneer in food transformation and solar heaters it offers vocational training in West Africa and Madagascar There is also currently a notable resurgence as viewed by the number of groups adopting \n open source appropriate technology \n OSAT because of the enabling technology of the Internet These OSAT groups include \n Akvo Foundation \n Appropedia \n Appropriate Technology Collaborative \n Catalytic Communities \n Centre for Alternative Technology \n Center For Development Alternatives \n Engineers Without Borders \n Open Source Ecology \n Practical Action \n and \n Village Earth \n Most recently \n ASME \n Engineers Without Borders USA and the \n IEEE \n have joined together to produce \n Engineering for Change \n which facilitates the development of affordable locally appropriate and sustainable solutions to the most pressing humanitarian challenges \n Terminology \n Appropriate technology frequently serves as an umbrella term for a variety names for this type of technology Frequently these terms are used interchangeably however the use of one term over another can indicate the specific focus bias or agenda of the technological choice in question Though the original name for the concept now known as appropriate technology \"intermediate technology\" is now often considered a subset of appropriate technology that focuses on technology that is more productive than \"inefficient\" traditional technologies but less costly than the technology of industrialized societies \n Other types of technology under the appropriate technology umbrella include \n Capital-saving technology \n Labor-intensive technology \n Alternate technology \n Self-help technology \n Village-level technology \n Community technology \n Progressive technology \n Indigenous technology \n Peoples technology \n Light-engineering technology \n Adaptive technology \n Light-capital technology \n Soft technology \n A variety of competing definitions exist in academic literature and organization and government policy papers for each of these terms \n However the general consensus is appropriate technology encompasses the ideas represented by the above list Furthermore the use of one term over another in referring to an appropriate technology can indicate ideological bias or emphasis on particular economic or social variables Some terms inherently emphasize the importance of increased employment and labor utilization such as labor-intensive or capital-saving technology while others may emphasize the importance of human development such as self-help and people's technology \n It is also possible to distinguish between \n hard \n and \n soft \n technologies According to Dr \n Maurice Albertson \n and Audrey Faulkner appropriate \n hard \n technology is \"engineering techniques physical structures and machinery that meet a need defined by a community and utilize the material at hand or readily available It can be built operated and maintained by the local people with very limited outside assistance e g technical material or financial it is usually related to an economic goal \" \n Albertson and Faulkner consider appropriate \n soft \n technology as technology that deals with \"the social structures human interactive processes and motivation techniques It is the structure and process for social participation and action by individuals and groups in analyzing situations making choices and engaging in choice-implementing behaviors that bring about change \" \n Practitioners \n Some of the well known practitioners of the appropriate technology-sector include \n B V Doshi \n Buckminster Fuller \n William Moyer \n Amory Lovins \n Sanoussi Diakit \n Albert Bates \n Victor Papanek \n Giorgio Ceragioli \n Frithjof Bergmann \n Arne Nss \n and \n Mansur Hoda \n Laurie Baker \n Development \n Schumacher's initial concept of intermediate technology was created as a critique of the currently prevailing development strategies which focused on maximizing aggregate economic growth through increases to overall measurements of a country's economy such as \n gross domestic product \n GDP \n Developed countries became aware of the situation of developing countries during and in the years following \n World War II \n Based on the continuing rise in income levels in Western countries since the Industrial Revolution developed countries embarked on a campaign of massive transfers of capital and technology to developing countries in order to force a rapid industrialization intended to result in an economic \"take-off\" in the developing countries \n However by the late 1960s it was becoming clear this development method had not worked as expected and a growing number of development experts and national policy makers were recognizing it as a potential cause of increasing poverty and income inequality in developing countries \n In many countries this influx of technology had increased the overall economic capacity of the country However it had created a dual or two-tiered economy with pronounced division between the classes The foreign technology imports were only benefiting a small minority of urban elites This was also increasing urbanization with the rural poor moving to urban cities in hope of more financial opportunities The increased strain on urban infrastructures and public services led to \"increasing squalor severe impacts on public health and distortions in the social structure \" \n Appropriate technology was meant to address four problems extreme poverty starvation unemployment and urban migration Schumacher saw the main purpose for economic development programs was the eradication of extreme poverty and he saw a clear connection between mass unemployment and extreme poverty Schumacher sought to shift development efforts from a bias towards urban areas and on increasing the output per laborer to focusing on rural areas where a majority of the population still lived and on increasing employment \n In developed countries \n The term \n appropriate technology \n is also used in developed nations to describe the use of technology and engineering that result in less negative impacts on the environment and society i e technology should be both environmentally sustainable and socially appropriate \n E F Schumacher \n asserts that such technology described in the book \n Small is Beautiful \n tends to promote values such as \n health \n beauty \n and permanence in that order \n Often the type of appropriate technology that is used in developed countries is \"appropriate and sustainable technology\" AST \n appropriate technology that besides being functional and relatively cheap though often more expensive than true AT is durable and employs \n renewable resources \n AT does not include this see \n Sustainable design \n Applications \n Building and construction \n In order to increase the efficiency of a great number of city services efficient water provisioning efficient electricity provisioning easy traffic flow water drainage decreased spread of disease with \n epidemics \n the city itself must first be built correctly In the developing world many cities are expanding rapidly and new ones are being built Looking into the \n cities design \n in advance is a must for every developing nation \n Further information \n Earth structure \n Autonomous building \n and \n Earthship \n Adobe \n including the variation called \n Super Adobe \n Rammed earth \n Compressed earth block \n Animal \n products \n Cob \n and/or other \n green building materials \n could be considered appropriate earth building technology for much of the developing world as they make use of materials which are widely available locally and are thus relatively inexpensive \n The local context must be considered as for example \n mudbrick \n may not be durable in a high rainfall area although a large roof overhang and \n cement \n stabilisation can be used to correct for this and if the materials are not readily available the method may be inappropriate Other forms of \n natural building \n may be considered appropriate technology though in many cases the emphasis is on \n sustainability \n and self-sufficiency rather than affordability or suitability As such many buildings are also built to function as \n autonomous buildings \n e g \n earthships \n One example of an organisation that applies appropriate earthbuilding techniques would be \n Builders Without Borders \n The building structure must also be considered Cost-effectiveness is an important issue in projects based around appropriate technology and one of the most efficient designs herein is the \n public housing \n approach This approach lets everyone have their own \n sleeping/recreation space \n yet incorporate communal spaces e g \n mess halls \n latrines \n public showers \n In addition to decrease costs of operation heating cooling techniques as \n Earth sheltering \n Trombe walls \n are often incorporated \n Organizations as \n Architecture for Humanity \n also follows principles consistent with appropriate technology aiming to serve the needs of poor and disaster-affected people \n Chunche \n naturally ventilated sheds for drying \n raisins \n in \n Xinjiang \n Natural ventilation \n can be created by providing vents in the upper level of a building to allow warm air to rise by \n convection \n and escape to the outside while cooler air is drawn in through vents at the lower level \n Electrical powered fans e g \n ceiling fans \n allow efficient cooling at a far lower electricity consumption as airconditioning systems \n A \n solar chimney \n often referred to as \n thermal chimney \n improves this natural \n ventilation \n by using \n convection \n of \n air \n heated by \n passive solar energy \n To further maximize the cooling effect the incoming air may be led through \n underground ducts \n before it is allowed to enter the building \n A \n windcatcher \n Badgir \n is a traditional \n Persian \n architectural device \n used for many centuries to create natural ventilation in buildings It is not known who first invented the windcatcher but it still can be seen in many countries today Windcatchers come in various designs such as the uni-directional bi-directional and multi-directional \n A \n passive down-draft cooltower \n may be used in a hot arid climate to provide a sustainable way to provide \n air conditioning \n Water is allowed to evaporate at the top of a tower either by using evaporative cooling pads or by spraying water \n Evaporation \n cools the incoming air causing a \n downdraft \n of cool air that will bring down the temperature inside the building \n Agriculture \n Appropriate technology has been applied extensively to improve agricultural production in developing countries In the United States the \n National Center for Appropriate Technology \n operates ATTRA attra ncat org a national \n sustainable agriculture \n assistance program \n Water and sanitation \n Water \n Further information \n drinking water \n Hand-operated reciprocating positive displacement water pump in \n Koice \n - \n Tahanovce \n Slovakia \n walking beam pump \n As of waterborne diseases are estimated to cause million deaths each year while about billion people lack proper drinking water \n Water generally needs treatment before use depending on the source and the intended use with high standards required for drinking water The quality of water from household connections and community water points in low-income countries is not reliably safe for direct human consumption Water extracted directly from surface waters and open hand-dug shallow wells nearly always requires treatment \n Appropriate technology options in water treatment include both community-scale and household-scale point-of-use POU designs \n The most reliable way to kill microbial pathogenic agents is to heat water to a rolling boil \n Other techniques such as varying forms of filtration chemical disinfection and exposure to ultraviolet radiation including solar UV have been demonstrated in an array of randomized control trials to significantly reduce levels of waterborne disease among users in low-income countries \n Over the past decade an increasing number of field-based studies have been undertaken to determine the success of POU measures in reducing waterborne disease The ability of POU options to reduce disease is a function of both their ability to remove microbial pathogens if properly applied and such social factors as ease of use and cultural appropriateness Technologies may generate more or less health benefit than their lab-based microbial removal performance would suggest \n The current priority of the proponents of POU treatment is to reach large numbers of low-income households on a sustainable basis Few POU measures have reached significant scale thus far but efforts to promote and commercially distribute these products to the world's poor have only been under way for a few years \n On the other hand small-scale water treatment is reaching increasing fractions of the population in low-income countries particularly in South and Southeast Asia in the form of water treatment kiosks also known as water refill stations or packaged water producers While quality control and quality assurance in such locations may be variable sophisticated technology such as multi-stage particle filtration UV irradiation ozonation and membrane filtration is applied with increasing frequency Such microenterprises are able to vend water at extremely low prices with increasing government regulation Initial assessments of vended water quality are encouraging \n Whether applied at the household or community level some examples of specific treatment processes include \n Porous ceramic filtration \n using either clay or \n diatomaceous earth \n and oriented as either cylinder pot or disk with gravity-fed or siphon-driven delivery systems Silver is frequently added to provide antimicrobial enhancement \n Intermittently operated \n slow-sand filtration \n also known as biosand filtration \n Chlorine disinfection \n employing calcium hypochlorite powder sodium hypochlorite solution or sodium dichloroisocyanurate NaDCC tablets \n Chemical flocculation \n using either commercially produced iron or aluminum salts or the crushed seeds of certain plants such as \n Moringa oleifera \n Recent work has shown even table salt NaCl is effective at removing high-activity clays for solar water disinfection \n Irradiation with ultraviolet light \n whether using electric-powered lamps or direct solar exposure such as with the \n SODIS \n method \n Mixed flocculation/disinfection using commercially produced powdered mixtures \n membrane filtration employing \n ultrafiltration \n or \n reverse osmosis \n filter elements preceded by pretreatment \n Some appropriate technology water supply measures include \n Deep wells with submersible pumps \n in areas where the groundwater aquifers are located at depths >10 m \n Shallow wells \n with lined walls and covers \n Rainwater harvesting \n systems with an appropriate method of storage especially in areas with significant dry seasons \n Fog collection \n which is suitable for areas which experience fog even when there is little rain \n Air wells \n a structure or device designed to promote the condensation of atmospheric moisture \n Handpumps and treadle pumps are generally only an option in areas is located at a relatively shallow depth e g m The \n Flexi-Pipe Pump \n is a notable exception to this up to meter For deeper aquifers <10 m \n submersible pumps placed inside a well \n are used Treadle pumps for household irrigation are now being distributed on a widespread basis in developing countries The principle of \n Village Level Operation and Maintenance \n is important with handpumps but may be difficult in application \n Condensation bags and condensation pits can be an appropriate technology to get water yet yields are low and are for the amount of water obtained labour-intensive Still it may be a good very cheap solution for certain desperate communities \n The \n hippo water roller \n and Q-drum allow more water to be carried with less effort and could thus be a good alternative for ethnic communities who do not wish to give up water gathering from remote locations assuming low topographic relief \n The \n roundabout playpump \n developed and used in southern \n Africa \n harnesses the energy of children at play to pump water \n Sanitation \n Sanitation \n Poor sanitation is a major issue for a large proportion of the human population with about billion people lacking even the most basic forms of sanitation and more than a billion people worldwide practising \n open defecation \n in according to the \n Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation \n of the \n United Nations \n The ideas of appropriate technology influenced the provision of sanitation systems for many years However since about the early 2000s there has been a departure from a focus on simplistic 'one-size-fits-all' sanitation systems \n As conditions vary sanitation systems also need to vary to meet the needs of the users and other \n stakeholders \n Technologies for sanitation provision such as \n toilets \n are important but only one piece of the puzzle Sanitation needs to be regarded as a system that includes technical and non-technical aspects such as \n behavior change \n and management as well as political aspects the enabling environment \n The overall aim should be to achieve a \n sustainable sanitation \n system One option of achieving that aim can be the \n ecological sanitation \n approach which focuses on safe \n reuse of excreta \n It is impossible to name all possible sanitation technologies that may fall under the category of \"appropriate technologies\" but some common systems which might be considered to be \"appropriate\" include \n Dry toilets \n as they save on flushing water and may allow the nutrients of the excreta to be reused in agriculture e g for fertilising crops Two examples of dry toilets are \n composting toilets \n and \n urine-diverting dry toilets \n Constructed wetlands \n which can treat \n wastewater \n and \n greywater \n and require only little electrical power \n The SanPlat is a simple plate that can be used to cover the hole in the ground of \n pit latrines \n making them potentially more easy to clean and maintain \n The \n Arborloo \n which is a very simple low-cost type of composting toilet suitable for rural areas \n Energy generation and uses \n Further information \n Microgeneration \n and \n Remote-area power supply \n The term \n soft energy technology \n was coined by \n Amory Lovins \n to describe \"appropriate\" renewable energy \n \"Appropriate\" energy technologies are especially suitable for isolated and/or small scale energy needs Electricity can be provided from \n Photovoltaic PV solar panels \n and large \n Concentrating solar power \n plants PV solar panels made from \n low-cost photovoltaic cells \n or PV-cells which have first been concentrated by a \n Luminescent solar concentrator \n -panel are also a good option

intended to replace \n halogen \n reflector lamps \n White \n LEDs \n and a source of \n renewable energy \n such as \n solar cells \n are used by the \n Light Up the World Foundation \n to provide lighting to poor people in remote areas and provide significant benefits compared to the \n kerosene lamps \n which they replace Certain other companies as \n Powerplus \n also have \n LED-flashlights with imbedded solar cells \n Organic LEDs \n made by \n roll-to-roll production \n are another source of cheap light that will be commercially available at low cost by \n Compact fluorescent lamps \n as well as regular \n fluorescent lamps \n and \n LED-lightbulbs \n can also be used as appropriate technology Although they are less environmentally friendly then LED-lights they are cheaper and still feature relative high efficiency compared to incandescent lamps \n The \n Safe bottle lamp \n is a safer \n kerosene lamp \n designed in Sri Lanka Lamps as these allow relative long mobile lighting The safety comes from a secure screw-on metal lid and two flat sides which prevent it from rolling if knocked over An alternative to fuel or oil-based lanterns is the Uday lantern developed by Philips as part of its \n Lighting Africa \n project sponsored by the World Bank Group \n The \n Faraday flashlight \n is a LED flashlight which operates on a capacitor Recharging can be done by manual winching or by shaking hereby avoiding the need of any supplementary electrical system \n HID-lamps \n finally can be used for lighting operations where regular LED-lighting or other lamps will not suffice Examples are car headlights Due to their high efficiency they are quite environmental yet costly and they still require polluting materials in their production process \n Transportation \n A man uses a bicycle to cargo goods in \n Ouagadougou \n Burkina Faso \n Human powered-vehicles \n include the \n bicycle \n and the future \n bamboo bicycle \n which provides general-purpose transportation at lower costs compared to motorized vehicles and many advantages over walking and the \n whirlwind wheelchair \n which provides mobility for disabled people who cannot afford the expensive wheelchairs used in developed countries \n Animal powered vehicles/transport \n may also be another appropriate technology Certain \n zero-emissions vehicles \n may be considered appropriate transportation technology including \n compressed air cars \n liquid nitrogen \n and \n hydrogen-powered \n vehicles Also vehicles with internal combustion engines may be converted to hydrogen or oxyhydrogen combustion \n Bicycles can also be applied to commercial transport of goods to and from remote areas An example of this is Karaba a free-trade coffee co-op in Rwanda which uses modified bicycles to carry hundreds of pounds of coffee beans for processing \n Other projects for developing countries include the redesign of cycle rickshaws to convert them to electric power \n However recent reports suggest that these rickshaws are not plying on the roads \n Health care \n According to the \n Global Health Council \n rather than the use of professionally schooled doctors the training of villagers to remedy most maladies in towns in the developing world is most appropriate \n Trained villagers are able to eliminate 80% of the health problems Small low-cost hospitals based on the model of the Jamkhed hospital can remedy another 15% while only 5% will need to go to a larger more expensive hospital \n Before being able to determine the cause of the disease or malady accurate diagnosis is required This may be done manually through observation inquiries and by specialized tools \n A \n phase-change incubator \n developed in the late 1990s is a low cost way for health workers to incubate microbial samples \n Birth control \n is also seen as an appropriate technology especially now because of increasing population numbers overpopulating certain areas increasing food prices and poverty It has been proposed to a certain degree by PATH program for appropriate technology in health \n Jaipur leg \n was developed by Dr P K Sethi and Masterji Ram Chander in as an inexpensive prosthetic leg for victims of landmine explosions \n The \n Leveraged Freedom Chair \n is a low-cost wheelchair designed specifically for rough terrain \n Natural cleaning products can be used for personal hygiene and cleaning of clothing and eating utensils in order to decrease illnesses/maladies as they eliminate a great amount of pathogens \n Note that many Appropriate Technologies benefit \n public health \n in particular by providing \n sanitation \n and safe drinking water Refrigeration may also provide a health benefit These are discussed in the following paragraphs This was too found at the \n Comprehensive Rural Health Project \n and the Women Health Volunteers projects in countries as Iran Iraq and Nepal \n Food preparation and storage \n

is best avoided \n citation needed \n One such system for the developing world is discussed here \n Crop production tools are best kept simple reduces operating difficulty cost replacement difficulties and pollution when compared to motorized equipment Tools can include \n scythes \n animal-pulled \n plows \n although no-till farming should be preferred \n dibbers \n wheeled \n augers \n for planting large trees \n kirpis \n hoes \n Greenhouses \n are also sometimes included see Earthship Biotincture \n citation needed \n Sometimes they are also fitted with irrigation systems and/or \n heat sink \n -systems which can respectively irrigate the plants or help to store energy from the sun and redistribute it at night when the greenhouse starts to cool down \n According to proponents Appropriate Technologies can greatly reduce the labor required to prepare food compared to traditional methods while being much simpler and cheaper than the processing used in Western countries This reflects \n E F Schumacher \n 's concept of \"intermediate technology \" i e technology which is significantly more effective and expensive than traditional methods but still an order of magnitude times cheaper than developed world technology Key examples are \n the \n Malian peanut sheller \n the \n fonio husking machine \n the \n screenless hammer mill \n the \n ISF corn mill \n the \n ISF rice huller \n all other types of electrical or hand-operated \n kitchen \n equipment grinders cutters Special multifunctional kitchen robots that are able to perform several functions e g grinding cutting and even vacuum cleaning and polishing are able to reduce costs even more Examples of these devices were e g the now discontinued \n Piccolo \n household appliance from Hammelmann Werke previously based in Bad Kissingen It was equipped with a flexible axis allowing a variety of aids to be screwed on \n In Ghana Zouzugu villagers use solar cookers for preparing their meals \n Solar cookers \n are appropriate to some settings depending on climate and cooking style They are emission-less and very low-cost Hybrid variants also exist that incorporate a second heating source such as electrical heating or wood-based \n Hot plates \n are 100% electrical fairly low cost around and are mobile They do however require an electrical system to be present in the area of operation \n Rocket stoves \n and certain other woodstoves e g Philips Woodstove \n improve fuel efficiency and reduce harmful indoor air pollution The stoves however still make use of wood However \n briquette \n makers can now \n turn organic waste into fuel \n saving money and/or collection time and preserving forests \n Solar \n special \n Einstein refrigerators \n and thermal mass \n refrigerators \n reduce the amount of electricity required Also solar and special Einstein refrigerators do not use haloalkanes which play a key role in ozone depletion but use heat pumps or mirrors instead Solar refrigerators have been built for developing nations by Sopology \n The \n pot-in-pot refrigerator \n is an African invention which keeps things cool without electricity It provides a way to keep food and produce fresh for much longer than would otherwise be possible This can be a great benefit to the families who use the device For example it is claimed that girls who had to regularly sell fresh produce in the market can now go to school instead as there is less urgency to sell the produce before it loses freshness \n Information and communication technologies \n Information and communication technologies for development \n Netbooks \n such as the \n Asus Eee PC \n accommodate low-cost information sharing and communication \n The \n OLPC XO \n Simputer \n Asus Eee PC \n and other low cost computers are computers aimed at developing countries Besides the low price other characteristics include resistance to dust reliability and use of the target language \n Eldis OnDisc and \n The Appropriate Technology Library \n are projects that use \n CDs \n and \n DVDs \n to give access to development information in areas without reliable and affordable internet access \n The \n wind-up radio \n and the computer and communication system planned by the \n Jhai Foundation \n are independent from power supply \n There is also \n GrameenPhone \n which fused mobile telephony with \n Grameen Bank \n 's microfinance program to give Bangladeshi villagers access to communication \n Mobile telephony \n is appropriate technology for many developing countries as it greatly reduces the \n infrastructure \n required to achieve widespread coverage However \n mobile phone \n network may not always be available it depends on the location and may not always provide both voice and data services \n Loband \n a website developed by \n Aptivate \n strips all the photographic and other bandwidth-intensive content from webpages and renders them as simple text while otherwise allowing one to \n browse \n them normally The site greatly increasing the speed of browsing and is appropriate for use on low bandwidth connections as generally available in much of the developing world \n An increasing number of activists provide free or very inexpensive \n web \n and \n email \n services using cooperative computer networks that run wireless \n ad hoc networks \n Network service is provided by a cooperative of neighbors each operating a router as a household appliance These minimize wired infrastructure and its costs and vulnerabilities Private \n Internet protocol \n networks set up in this way can operate without the use of a commercial provider \n Rural electrical grids can be wired with \"optical phase cable\" in which one or more of the \n steel \n armor \n wires are replaced with steel tubes containing \n fiber optics \n Satellite Internet access \n can provide high speed connectivity to remote locations however these are significantly more expensive than wire-based or terrestrial wireless systems \n Wimax \n and forms of \n packet radio \n can also be used Depending on the speed and latency of these networks they may be capable of relaying \n VoIP \n traffic negating the need for separate telephony services Finally the \n Internet Radio Linking Project \n provides potential for blending older cheap local radio broadcasting with the increased range of the internet \n satellite \n -based telephone systems can also be used as either fixed installations or portable handsets and can be integrated into a \n PABX \n or local IP-based network \n Finance \n Through financial systems envisioned especially for the poor/developed world many companies have been able to get started with only limited capital Often banks lend the money to people wishing to start a business such as with \n microfinance \n In other systems people for a \n Rotating Savings and Credit Association \n or ROSCA to purchase costly material together such as \n Tontines \n and \n Susu accounts \n Organisations communities cities or individuals can provide loans to other communities/cities such as with the approach followed by \n Kiva \n World Vision Microloans \n MicroPlace \n and \n LETS \n Finally in certain communities usually isolated communities such as small islands or oases everything of value is shared This is called \n gift economy \n Determining a sustainable approach \n Features such as low cost low usage of \n fossil fuels \n and use of locally available resources can give some advantages in terms of \n sustainability \n For that reason these technologies are sometimes used and promoted by advocates of sustainability and \n alternative technology \n Besides using natural locally available resources \n e g wood or adobe waste materials imported from cities using conventional and inefficient waste management may be gathered and re-used to build a sustainable living environment Use of these cities' waste material allows the gathering of a huge amount of building material at a low cost When obtained the materials may be recycled over and over in the own city/community using the \n cradle to cradle design \n method Locations where waste can be found include \n landfills \n junkyards \n on water surfaces and anywhere around towns or near highways Organic waste that can be reused to fertilise plants can be found in sewages Also town districts and other places e g \n cemeteries \n that are subject of undergoing renovation or removal can be used for gathering materials as stone concrete or potassium \n

and environmental science There is an additional focus on the present generations' responsibility to regenerate maintain and improve planetary resources for use by future generations \n Sustainable development has its roots in ideas about \n sustainable forest management \n which were developed in Europe during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries \n In response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England \n John Evelyn \n argued that \"sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources\" in his essay \n Sylva \n In \n Hans Carl von Carlowitz \n a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector \n Frederick Augustus I of Saxony \n published \n Sylvicultura oeconomica \n a 400-page work on forestry Building upon the ideas of Evelyn and French minister \n Jean-Baptiste Colbert \n von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for \n sustained yield \n His work influenced others including \n Alexander von Humboldt \n and \n Georg Ludwig Hartig \n eventually leading to the development of a science of forestry This in turn influenced people like \n Gifford Pinchot \n first head of the \n US Forest Service \n whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources and \n Aldo Leopold \n whose \n land ethic \n was influential in the development of the \n environmental movement \n in the 1960s \n Following the publication of \n Rachel Carson \n 's \n Silent Spring \n in the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation \n Kenneth E Boulding \n in his influential essay \n The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth \n identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources \n One of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the \n Club of Rome \n in in its classic report on the \n Limits to Growth \n written by a group of scientists led by \n Dennis \n and \n Donella Meadows \n of the \n Massachusetts Institute of Technology \n Describing the desirable \"state of global equilibrium\" the authors wrote \"We are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people \" \n In the \n International Union for the Conservation of Nature \n published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority \n and introduced the term \"sustainable development\" \n Two years later the \n United Nations \n World Charter for Nature \n raised five principles of \n conservation \n by which human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged \n In the \n United Nations \n World Commission on Environment and Development \n released the report \n Our Common Future \n commonly called the Brundtland Report The report included what is now one of the most widely recognised definitions of sustainable development \n Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs It contains within it two key concepts \n The concept of 'needs' in particular the essential needs of the world's poor to which overriding priority should be given and \n The idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs \n World Commission on Environment and Development \n Our Common Future \n Since the Brundtland Report the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of \"socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth\" \n In the \n UN Conference on Environment and Development \n published the \n Earth Charter \n which outlines the building of a just sustainable and peaceful global society in the 21st century The action plan \n Agenda \n for sustainable development identified information integration and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars It emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information It stresses the need to change from old sector-centered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross-sectoral co-ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes Furthermore Agenda emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development \n Under the principles of the \n United Nations Charter \n the \n Millennium Declaration \n identified principles and treaties on sustainable development including \n economic development \n social development \n and \n environmental protection \n Broadly defined sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural produced and \n social capital \n for the welfare of their own and future generations The term sustainable development as used by the United Nations incorporates both issues associated with \n land development \n and broader issues of \n human development \n such as education public health and standard of living \n

\"ecology economy and equity\" \n This has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture institutions or governance \n or alternatively reconfigured as four domains of the social

Ecological engineering \n Relationship between \n ecological footprint \n and \n Human Development Index \n HDI \n The \n ecological stability \n of human settlements is part of the relationship between humans and their natural social and \n built environments \n Also termed \n human ecology \n this broadens the focus of sustainable development to include the domain of human health Fundamental human needs such as the availability and quality of air water food and shelter are also the ecological foundations for sustainable development \n addressing public health risk through investments in \n ecosystem services \n can be a powerful and transformative force for sustainable development which in this sense extends to all species \n Environmental sustainability concerns the \n natural environment \n and how it endures and remains diverse and productive Since \n natural resources \n are derived from the environment the state of air water and the climate are of particular concern The \n IPCC Fifth Assessment Report \n outlines current knowledge about scientific technical and socio-economic information concerning \n climate change \n and lists options for \n adaptation \n and \n mitigation \n Environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet This for example entails using water sustainably utilizing renewable energy and sustainable material supplies e g harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity \n citation needed \n An unsustainable situation occurs when \n natural capital \n the sum total of nature's resources is used up faster than it can be replenished Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity Theoretically the long-term result of \n environmental degradation \n is the inability to sustain human life Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support \n citation needed \n If the degradation continues beyond a certain \n tipping point \n or critical threshold it would lead to eventual \n extinction \n for humanity \n citation needed \n Consumption of non-renewable resources \n State of environment \n Sustainability \n More than nature's ability to replenish \n Environmental degradation \n Not sustainable \n Equal to nature's ability to replenish \n Environmental equilibrium \n Steady state economy \n Less than nature's ability to replenish \n Environmental renewal \n Environmentally sustainable \n Integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities A telling example is the \n European environmental research and innovation policy \n which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme \n Horizon \n which is also open to participation worldwide \n A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible \n Pollution of the public resources is really not a different action it just is a reverse tragedy of the commons in that instead of taking something out something is put into the commons When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed then it becomes only natural to pollute as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons So the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it through taxes or fines more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge \n So one can try to appeal to the ethics of the situation by doing the right thing as an individual but in the absence of any direct consequences the individual will tend to do what is best for the person and not what is best for the common good of the public Once again this issue needs to be addressed Because left unaddressed the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way So this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use \n Agriculture \n Sustainable agriculture \n Sustainable agriculture consists of \n environment friendly \n methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems It involves preventing adverse effects to soil water biodiversity surrounding or downstream resourcesas well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighboring areas The concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally passing on a conserved or improved natural resource biotic and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted \n Elements of sustainable agriculture include \n permaculture \n agroforestry \n mixed farming \n multiple cropping \n and \n crop rotation \n Numerous \n sustainability standards and certification \n systems exist including \n organic certification

treated as important economic assets called \n natural capital \n Economic development has traditionally required a growth in the \n gross domestic product \n This model of unlimited personal and GDP growth may be over \n Sustainable development may involve improvements in the quality of life for many but may necessitate a decrease in \n resource consumption \n According to ecological economist \n Malte Faber \n ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature justice and time Issues of \n intergenerational equity \n irreversibility \n of environmental change \n uncertainty \n of long-term outcomes and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation \n As early as the 1970s the concept of sustainability was used to describe an \n economy \n \"in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems\" \n Scientists in many fields have highlighted \n The Limits to Growth \n and economists have presented alternatives for example a ' \n steady-state economy \n ' \n to address concerns over the impacts of expanding human development on the planet In the economist Edward Barbier published the study \n The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development \n where he recognised that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other \n A \n World Bank \n study from concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability in \n macroeconomics \n or purely environmental \n A study from noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare eventually reaching a golden-rule steady state \n The study \n Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms \n found three pillars of sustainable development interlinkage \n intergenerational equity \n and \n dynamic efficiency \n But \n Gilbert Rist \n points out that the World Bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem He writes \"From this angle 'sustainable development' looks like a cover-up operation The thing that is meant to be sustained is really 'development' not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies \" \n The World Bank a leading producer of environmental knowledge continues to advocate the win-win prospects for economic growth and ecological stability even as its economists express their doubts \n Herman Daly \n an economist for the Bank from to writes \n When authors of \n WDR \n '92 the highly influential \n World Development Report \n that featured the environment were drafting the report they called me asking for examples of \"win-win\" strategies in my work What could I say? None exists in that pure form there are trade-offs not \"win-wins \" But they want to see a world of \"win-wins\" based on articles of faith not fact I wanted to contribute because \n WDR \n s are important in the Bank because task managers read them to find philosophical justification for their latest round of projects But they did not want to hear about how things really are or what I find in my work \" \n A meta review in looked at environmental and economic valuations and found a lack of \"sustainability policies\" \n A study in asked if we consume too much \n A study concluded in that knowledge manufactured and human capital health and education has not compensated for the degradation of natural capital in many parts of the world \n It has been suggested that intergenerational equity can be incorporated into a sustainable development and decision making as has become common in economic valuations of climate economics \n A meta review in identified conditions for a strong case to act on \n climate change \n and called for more work to fully account of the relevant economics and how it affects human welfare \n According to \n free-market environmentalist \n John Baden \n \"the improvement of environment quality depends on the \n market economy \n and the existence of legitimate and protected \n property \n rights\" They enable the effective practice of personal responsibility and the development of mechanisms to protect the environment The State can in this context \"create conditions which encourage the people to save the environment\" \n Misum Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets based at \n Stockholm School of Economics \n aims to provide policy research and advice to Swedish and international actors on Sustainable Markets Misum is a cross-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder knowledge center dedicated to sustainability and sustainable markets and contains three research platforms Sustainability in Financial Markets Mistra Financial Systems Sustainability in Production and Consumption and Sustainable Socio-Economic Development \n Environmental economics \n Environmental economics \n The total environment includes not just the biosphere of earth air and water but also human interactions with these things with nature and what humans have created as their surroundings \n As countries around the world continue to advance economically they put a strain on the ability of the natural environment to absorb the high level of pollutants that are created as a part of this economic growth Therefore solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow but not at the expense of the public good In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource This is a resource to be protected One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited \n Benefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis \n citation needed \n Energy \n Main articles \n Smart grid \n and \n Sustainable energy \n Sustainable energy is clean and can be used

communities are historically left out during the decision-making process and often end up with dirty power plants and other dirty energy projects that poison the air and harm the area These toxicants are major contributors to health problems in the communities As renewable energy becomes more common fossil fuel infrastructures are replaced by renewables providing better social equity to these

open-source appropriate technology \n OSAT and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the \n Internet \n OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling \n innovation \n for sustainable development \n Transport \n Sustainable transport \n Transportation is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions It is said that one-third of all gasses produced are due to transportation \n Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change \n Sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development According to a series of reports by the \n Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership LEDS GP \n sustainable transport can help create jobs \n improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways \n make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient It also offers a practical opportunity to save people's time and household income as well as government budgets \n making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity \n Some western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations \n An example is the modifications in available transportation in \n Freiburg Germany \n The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation cycling and walking along with large areas where cars are not allowed \n Since many western countries are highly automobile-orientated areas the main transit that people use is personal vehicles About 80% of their travel involves cars \n Therefore California is one of the highest \n greenhouse gases \n emitters in the United States The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips in order to lower greenhouse gases emission Such as \n Improve public transit through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network \n Encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway bike share station in commercial downtown locate parking lot far from the shopping center limit on street parking slower traffic lane in downtown area \n Increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles This can produce a social equity problem since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities \n Other states and nations have built efforts to \n translate knowledge \n in \n behavioral economics \n into \n evidence-based \n sustainable transportation \n policies \n citation needed \n Business \n Corporate sustainability \n The most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firm's efficient use of natural capital This \n eco-efficiency \n is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact \n This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development \n WBCSD \n under the following definition \"Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life while progressively reducing ecological impacts and \n resource intensity \n throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity\" DeSimone and Popoff \n Similar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability Socio-efficiency \n describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact Whereas it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees this is not true for social impacts These can be either positive e g corporate giving creation of employment or negative e g work accidents mobbing of employees human rights abuses Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts i e accidents per value added or maximise positive social impacts i e donations per value added in relation to the value added \n citation needed \n Both eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations However as Dyllick and Hockerts \n point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development They point towards eco-effectiveness socio-effectiveness sufficiency and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached \n citation needed \n CASI Global New York \"CSR & Sustainability together lead to sustainable development CSR as in corporate social responsibility is not what you do with your profits but is the way you make profits This means CSR is a part of every department of the company value

Urbanism \n and \n New Classical architecture \n promote a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops \n smart growth \n architectural tradition \n and \n classical design \n This in contrast to \n modernist \n and \n International Style \n architecture as well as opposing to solitary \n housing estates \n and \n suburban sprawl \n with long commuting distances and large ecological footprints \n Both trends started in the 1980s It should be noted that sustainable architecture is predominantly relevant to the economics domain while architectural landscaping pertains more to the ecological domain \n citation needed \n Politics \n Environmental politics \n Environmental governance \n and \n Sustainability metrics and indices \n A study concluded that social indicators and therefore sustainable development indicators are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policy-making \n The \n International Institute for Sustainable Development \n has similarly developed a political policy framework linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics The framework consists of six core areas international trade and investment economic policy climate change and energy measurement and assessment natural resource management and the role of communication technologies in sustainable development \n The \n United Nations Global Compact \n Cities Programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance The political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation authorisation legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic ecological and cultural challenges It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed They have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics \n Organization and governance \n Law and justice \n Communication and critique \n Representation and negotiation \n Security and accord \n Dialogue and reconciliation \n Ethics and accountability \n This accords with the Brundtland Commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles see above \n Culture \n Framing of sustainable development progress according to the \n Circles of Sustainability \n used by the \n United Nations \n Working with a different emphasis some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development since the triple-bottom-line dimensions of economic environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society In this context the \n Agenda for culture \n and the \n United Cities and Local Governments \n UCLG Executive Bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement \"Culture Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development\" passed on November in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders 3rd World Congress of UCLG held in Mexico City This document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach developing a solid \n cultural policy \n and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies The \n Circles of Sustainability \n approach distinguishes the four domains of economic ecological political and cultural sustainability \n Other organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development The Network of Excellence \"Sustainable Development in a Diverse World\" \n sponsored by the \n European Union \n integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets \n cultural diversity \n as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development The Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development Theory has been referenced by executive director of IMI Institute at \n UNESCO \n Vito Di Bari \n in his manifesto of art and architectural movement \n Neo-Futurism \n whose name was inspired by the \n United Nations \n report \n Our Common Future \n The \n Circles of Sustainability \n approach used by Metropolis defines the fourth cultural domain as practices discourses and material expressions which over time express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning \n Themes \n This section \n possibly contains \n original research \n Please \n improve it \n by \n

Progress \n Sustainable development goals \n The \n United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \n UNCSD also known as Rio was the third international conference on sustainable development which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community An outcome of this conference was the development of the \n Sustainable Development Goals \n that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world However few nations met the \n World Wide Fund for Nature \n 's definition of sustainable development criteria established in \n Although some nations are more developed than others all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms \n Measurement \n Main articles \n Ecological footprint \n and \n Sustainability measurement \n Deforestation and increased road-building in the \n Amazon Rainforest \n are a concern because of increased human encroachment upon \n wilderness \n areas increased resource extraction and further threats to \n biodiversity \n In a report for the U S Environmental Protection Agency stated \"While much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable At best they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction or that our current activities are not sustainable More often they simply draw our attention to the existence of problems doing little to tell us the origin of those problems and nothing to tell us how to solve them \" \n Nevertheless a majority of authors assume that a set of well defined and harmonised indicators is the only way to make sustainability tangible Those indicators are expected to be identified and adjusted through empirical observations trial and error \n The most common critiques are related to issues like data quality comparability objective function and the necessary resources \n However a more general criticism is coming from the project management community How can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we cannot monitor it in any single project? \n The Cuban-born researcher and entrepreneur Sonia Bueno suggests an alternative approach that is based upon the integral long-term cost-benefit relationship as a measure and monitoring tool for the sustainability of every project activity or enterprise \n Furthermore this concept aims to be a practical guideline towards sustainable development following the principle of conservation and increment of value rather than restricting the consumption of resources \n citation needed \n Reasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen U S Green Building Council's USGBC Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED This design incorporates some ecological economic and social elements The goals presented by LEED design goals are sustainable sites water efficiency energy and atmospheric emission reduction material and resources efficiency and indoor environmental quality Although amount of structures for sustainability development is many these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building \n citation needed \n Recent research efforts created also the \n SDEWES Index \n to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy water and environment systems The \n SDEWES \n Index consists of dimensions indicators and close to sub-indicators It is currently applied to cities \n Natural capital \n Deforestation \n of native \n rain forest \n in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of \n clay \n for \n civil engineering \n picture \n The sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital economic social and natural which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible \n Leading \n ecological economist \n and \n steady-state theorist \n Herman Daly \n for example points to the fact that \n natural capital \n can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services such as the protection provided by the ozone layer or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest In fact natural capital social capital and economic capital are often complementarities A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources Forests for example not only provide the raw material for paper which can be substituted quite easily but they also maintain biodiversity regulate water flow and absorb CO2 \n citation needed \n Another problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility The \n loss of biodiversity \n for example is often definitive The same can be true for cultural diversity For example with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates Moreover the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached A lake can for example absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity However once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly \n citation needed \n Business-as-usual \n Before \n flue-gas desulfurization \n was installed the \n air-polluting \n emissions from this power plant in \n New Mexico \n contained excessive amounts of \n sulfur dioxide \n If the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it Cohen and Winn \n point to four types of market failure as possible explanations First while the benefits of natural or social capital depletion can usually be privatised the costs are often externalised i e they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general Second natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital Information asymmetry is a third reasonoften the link between cause and effect is obscured making it difficult for actors to make informed choices Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a \"business as usual\" mentality \n citation needed \n Education \n Main page \n Education for sustainable development \n Education must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive to continue to learn to solve problems to be creative and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives a quiet revolution is set in motion education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world \n Higher education in sustainability across education streams including engineering finance supply chain and operations is gaining weight-age Multiple institutes including Wharton Columbia CASI Global New York offer certifications in Sustainability Corporate's prefer employees certified in sustainability Reference \n Insubstantial stretching of the term \n It has been argued that since the 1960s the concept of sustainable development has changed from 'conservation management' to 'economic development' whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat \n In the 1960s the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil climate and water availability This was a strategy of conservation management In the 70s however the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries and not just in Africa This was a strategy of economic development and the strategy was carried even further by the \n Brundtland Commission \n 's report on \n Our Common Future \n when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application \n In effect the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers \n But shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of \n sustainable yield \n from the use of renewable resources only like forestry to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources like \n minerals \n This stretching of the term has been questioned Thus environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally there can be no such thing as overall 'sustainable development' in an industrialised \n world economy \n that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of Earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources \n It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource even with substantial \n recycling \n effort and use rates Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock \n In effect it has been argued that the \n Industrial Revolution \n as a whole is unsustainable \n 20f \n 22f \n One critic has argued that the \n Brundtland Commission \n promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of 'sustainable development' attached as a public relations slogan \n The report on \n Our Common Future \n was largely the result of a political bargaining process involving many special interest groups all put together to create a common appeal of political acceptability across borders After World War II the notion of 'development' had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world In the 1970s and 1980s this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights basic human needs and finally ecological issues The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populationsas usual This issue demanded more economic growth also in the rich countries who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them outas usual When the discussion switched to \n global ecological limits to growth \n the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency or what was termed 'a change in the \n quality \n of growth' However most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early 20th century already and as usual only this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever beforeand these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report Taken together the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact Since the publication of the report the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of 'sustainable development' has marched on worldwide the critic concludes \n Agroecology \n Applied sustainability \n Circular economy \n

policy makers with leading experts in their field to identify innovative solutions to the most pressing challenges facing cities \n The first World Cities Summit which took place in Singapore from to June focused on the theme of Liveable and Vibrant Cities The inaugural summit in June brought together senior delegates These include leaders government ministers city mayors senior government officials officials from international organisations business leaders academics from the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East policy makers and the civil society \n Among the issues examined there were the effective \n governance \n urban planning \n infrastructural development \n environmental sustainability \n climate change \n quality of life \n and economic competitiveness \n Speakers who attended include Haruhiko Kuroda President of the \n Asian Development Bank \n Anna Tibaijuka \n Executive Director of the \n United Nations Human Settlements Programme \n Lee Hsien Loong \n Prime Minister of Singapore Peter Rowe professor of architecture and urban design at \n Harvard University \n and the mayors of cities such as Melbourne Yokohama Bogota and Wellington among others There was also an exhibition to promote business links between the public and private sectors \n The summit was organised by \n Singapores Ministry of National Development \n the \n Singapore Civil Service College \n and the \n National University of Singapore \n s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy The \n World Bank \n Asian Development Bank \n United Nations Development Programme \n United Nations Environment Programme \n United Nations Human Settlements Programme UN-HABITAT and the \n United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific \n are involved as strategic partners The summit was held in conjunction with the \n East Asia Summit \n Conference on Liveable Cities as well as the \n Singapore International Water Week \n a water industry conference and trade show \n With increasing \n urbanisation \n and half the worlds population already living in cities \n the liveability of urban centres has attracted considerable attention in recent years especially given the increasing awareness of environmental sustainability issues and resource scarcity There are now several World's Most Liveable Cities type rankings such as the \n Mercer Quality of Living Survey \n and \n The Economist's World's Most Liveable Cities \n which undertake international comparisons based on living conditions and quality of life The Economists liveability ranking for example looks at more than cities and measures them against five sets of criteria infrastructure culture and environment healthcare education and stability \n Initiatives such as the \n World Mayor \n Award seek to highlight what can be done to improve the well-being of cities and communities through good leadership And the \n C40 Large Cities Climate Summit \n also known as the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group saw representatives from the worlds largest cities and businesses gathering in New York in to discuss the reduction of carbon emissions in urban areas where three-quarters of global energy consumption occurs \n The second biennial World Cities Summit WCS to be held from June to July returns with an even larger number of leading international speakers representing diverse cities in the Americas Europe Africa the Middle East and Asia Some of the notable figures include Mr Kamal Nath Indias Minister of Road Transport and Highways Mrs Carrie Lam Secretary of Development in Hong Kong SAR Mom Rajawongse Sukhumbhand Paribatra Governor of Bangkok Anna K Tibaijuka Executive Director of UN-HABITAT Haruhiko Kuroda President of the Asian Development Bank and Mr James Adams Vice President of the East Asia and Pacific Region World Bank Some ministers governors and mayors and more than high level experts from Asia the Middle East Europe and the United States have confirmed their attendance thus far \n These and other speakers will gather in Singapore to address issues on the practical aspects of city governance and integrated approaches to urban development under the Summits theme of Liveable and Sustainable Cities for the Future \n Jointly organised by the Centre for Liveable Cities CLC and the \n Singapore Civil Service College \n CSC this years Summit expects over delegates up from delegates in comprising ministers governors mayors senior government officials and business leaders Event highlights include the World Mayors Forum the World Cities Summit Expo several Expert Panel Sessions and various Learning Journeys \n Despite having the third highest population density in the world Singapore is often rated as one of the worlds most liveable cities One such ranking is the Mercers Quality of Life survey which identifies Singapore as the highest ranking Asian city among cities globally and the highest ranking city worldwide for city infrastructure As host nation of the biennial Summit Singapore is well placed to share its expertise in specific areas such as public housing waste management green infrastructure and urban planning \n The World Cities Summit commenced with high-level plenary sessions which explore the theme of Liveable and Sustainable Cities for the Future in different dimensions Attended by ministers and senior policy makers business leaders practitioners and futurists the plenary sessions will deal with cross-cutting issues around the interplay of people technologies and markets facing cities today with specific emphasis on leadership and governance sustainable and eco-friendly cities as well as harmonious and sustainable communities \n Complementing the plenary discussions there will be a series of high-level Expert Panel Sessions for government representatives policy makers and specific industry experts to discuss the challenges and solutions faced by cities around the world in greater details covering areas of urban planning infrastructure financing public housing built environment waste management climate change and urban biodiversity \n The World Mayors' Forum is a gathering of mayors to discuss solutions to the common urban challenges The forum will provide practical recommendations for joint actions where Mayors and city officials can work together to make their cities a better place - more liveable with healthier citizens better housing and better education \n The World Cities Summit Expo June to July themed Liveable and Sustainable Cities for the Future is a new platform to showcase model cities and innovative urban solutions that enhance economic value whilst addressing environmental challenges trade visitors are expected to attend the Expo \n The Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize is a biennial award to recognise individuals and organisations that have made outstanding contributions to the creation of vibrant liveable and sustainable urban communities around the world It seeks to recognise individuals and organisations responsible for urban initiatives that display foresight good governance or innovation in tackling the many urban challenges faced by cities \n These urban initiatives should incorporate principles of sustainable development and demonstrate an ability to bring social economic and environmental benefits in holistic way to communities around the world The Prize will also place an emphasis on practical and cost effective solutions and ideas that can be easily replicated across cities The inaugural Lee Kuan Yew World Cities is co-organised by the \n Urban Redevelopment Authority \n of Singapore URA and Centre for Liveable Cities CLC \n Learning Journeys are site visits that provide first-hand perspectives on how policies and ideas can be implemented successfully Hosted by diverse public sector agencies in Singapore these visits will give a behind-the-scenes look at specific projects while providing unique practical learning experiences for delegates \n Networking Forums are country-led forums with eminent speakers from across the globe Speakers comprise representatives from government trade and research organisations key technology providers financial institutions and urban authorities They will share a myriad of areas including city management development projects and opportunities in the global urban sector \n Global demographic trends indicate that the degree of urbanisation will increase and that more people will live in cities Already in more than half of the worlds population lived in cities \n Biodiversity will play an increasingly important role within the urban landscape \n Singapore \n though being a highly urbanised island-city-state still manages to retain a surprisingly rich array of biodiversity by virtue of its geographical location within a biodiversity hotspot Therefore Singapore is well suited and equipped with relevant expertise to establish a cities' biodiversity index \n Hence Singapore's Minister for National Development Mr \n Mah Bow Tan \n proposed the establishment of an index to measure biodiversity in cities at the 9th Meeting of the Parties to the \n Convention on Biological Diversity \n in \n Bonn \n Germany \n in May \n To lay out the details for the index the Secretariat of the \n Convention on Biological Diversity \n and the \n National Parks Board \n of Singapore jointly organised a Technical Expert Workshop on \n The Singapore Index on Cities' Biodiversity \n technical experts on biodiversity indicators as well as city executives responsible for implementation and management of biodiversity and urban projects attended the workshop \n The Singapore Index on Cities' Biodiversity would measure performance and assign scores based on three categories \n Biodiversity - the number of plant animal and other species that exist in a city \n The services that these plants and animals provide such as pollination and as carbon sinks \n How well a city manages its biodiversity - for instance by setting up a conservation agency or a museum to document species and habitats \n The Index will be presented for endorsement during the 10th Meeting of the Parties to the \n Convention on Biological Diversity \n in \n Nagoya \n Japan \n in October \n A Users Manual for the Singapore Index on Cities Biodiversity is available \n online \n More information about biodiversity conservation in Singapore is available from the \n National Biodiversity Centre \n Suzhou \n won the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize in for its transformation over the

the natural world through \n ecological \n and \n psychological \n principles \n The field seeks to develop and understand ways of expanding the emotional connection between individuals and the natural world thereby assisting individuals with developing sustainable lifestyles and remedying alienation from nature \n Theodore Roszak \n is credited with coining the term in his book \n The Voice of the Earth \n although a group of psychologists and environmentalists in Berkeley including Mary Gomes and Allen Kanner were independently using the term to describe their own work at the same time Roszak Gomes and Kanner later expanded the idea in the anthology \n Ecopsychology \n Two other books were especially formative for the field \n Paul Shepard \n 's volume \"Nature and Madness \" which explored the effect that our ever-diminishing engagement with wild nature had upon human psychological development and philosopher \n David Abram \n 's \n The Spell of the Sensuous Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World \n published in The latter was the first widely read book to bring phenomenology to bear on ecological and ecopsychological issues examining in detail the earthly dimensions of sensory experience and disclosing the historical effect of formal writing systems upon the human experience of nature's agency voice and interiority \n A central premise of ecopsychology is that while today the human mind is affected and shaped by the modern social world its deep structure is inevitably adapted to and informed by the more-than-human natural environment in which it evolved \n According to the \n biophilia hypothesis \n of biologist \n E O Wilson \n human beings have an innate instinct to connect emotionally with nature \n particularly the aspects of nature that recall what evolutionary psychologists have termed the \n environment of evolutionary adaptiveness \n the natural conditions that the \n human species \n evolved to inhabit \n The field of ecopsychology extends beyond the conventional purview of psychology which had traditionally considered the psyche to be a matter of relevance to humans alone Ecopsychology examines why people continue environmentally damaging behaviour and to develop methods of positive motivation for adopting sustainable practices \n Evidence suggests that many environmentally damaging behaviours are addictive at some level and thus are more effectively addressed through positive emotional fulfillment rather than by inflicting shame Other names used to refer to ecopsychology include depth ecology Gaia psychology \n psychoecology ecotherapy \n environmental psychology \n green psychology \n transpersonal ecology \n global therapy green therapy Earth-centered therapy reearthing nature-based psychotherapy shamanic counselling \n ecosophy \n and sylvan therapy \n Practical benefits \n Reasons to embrace nature \n Cultures that embrace nature \n Pain and delusions without nature \n Further reading \n Practical benefits \n Certain researchers propose that an individual's connection to nature can improve their interpersonal relationships and emotional wellbeing \n An integral part of this practice is to remove \n psychotherapy \n and the individual from the interior of office buildings and homes and place them outdoors \n According to the precepts of ecopsychology a walk in the woods or a city park is refreshing because it is what humans evolved to do Psychologists such as Roger Ulrich Rachel and Stephen Kaplan Frances Kuo and others have studied the beneficial effects of inhabiting natural settings and of looking at pictures of landscapes on the human psyche \n Richard Louv \n 's \n Last Child in the Woods \n Saving our Children from \n Nature-Deficit Disorder \n discusses in detail how the exposure of children to nature can assist in treating mental disorders including \n attention deficit disorder \n Another premise of ecopsychology is that steps taken to accept and notice nature can sharpen the senses and help people cultivate new skills For example the ability to track and navigate through a wilderness is improved if nature is noticed and accepted rather than feared Similarly ecopsychology proposes that sailors who appreciate the sea gain a keen sense for breeze directions \n Reasons to embrace nature \n Ecopsychology explores how to develop emotional bonds with \n nature \n It considers this to be worthwhile because when nature is explored and viewed without judgement it gives the sensations of harmony balance timelessness and stability Ecopsychology largely rejects \n reductionist \n views of nature that focus upon rudimentary building blocks such as \n genes \n and that describe nature as selfish and a struggle to survive Ecopsychology considers that there has been insufficient scientific description and exploration of nature in terms of \n wildness \n parsimony \n spirituality \n and emotional ties For example parsimony is the best way to produce an evolutionary tree of the species \n cladistics \n suggesting that parsimonious adaptations are selected Yet today the brain is often seen as complicated and governed by inherited mind modules rather than being a simple organ that looks for parsimony within the influences of its surroundings resulting in the compaction in minds of a great diversity of concepts \n Cultures that embrace nature \n In its exploration of how to bond with nature ecopsychology is interested in the examples provided by a wide variety of ancient and modern cultures that have histories of embracing nature Examples include \n aboriginal \n pagan \n Jain \n Buddhist \n and \n Hindu \n cultures as well as \n shamanism \n and the more recent \n hesychast \n tradition Of interest is how identity becomes entwined with nature so that loss of those sacred places is far more devastating to indigenous people than often understood \n Native American \n stories in particular illustrate a socially recognized sense of community between humans and the natural landscape \n The \n Mori \n philosophy and practice of kaitiakitanga or eco-guardianship and preservation emphasizes a deep connect between humans and their environment \n Eastern Orthodox monks led a contemplative life deeply intertwined with nature \n Other lessons include how to live sustainably within an environment and the self-sacrifices made to tolerate natural limits such as population control or a nomadic existence that allows the environment to regenerate Moreover certain indigenous cultures have developed methods of psychotherapy involving the presence of trees rivers and astronomical bodies \n Pain and delusions without nature \n Ecopsychologists have begun detecting unspoken grief within individuals an escalation of pain and despair felt in response to widespread environmental destruction The field of ecopsychology intends to illustrate how environmental disconnection functions as an aspect of existing \n pathologies \n without creating a new category The contention is that if a culture is disconnected from nature then various aspects of an individual's life will be negatively impacted \n It also believes that without the influence of nature humans are prone to a variety of delusions and that to some degree life in the wild forms the basis for human sanity and optimal psychological development The topic is explored in detail \n Paul Shepard \n 's book \n Nature and Madness \n It is also proposed that separation from outdoor contact causes a loss of sensory and information-processing ability that was developed over the course of human evolution which was spent in direct reciprocity with the environment \n Biophilia hypothesis \n Conservation psychology

\n Sustainable design \n also called environmentally sustainable design environmentally conscious design etc is the philosophy of designing physical objects the built environment and services to comply with the principles of \n social \n economic \n and \n ecological \n sustainability \n Theory \n Conceptual problems \n Diminishing returns \n Unsustainable investment \n Waste prevention \n Sustainable design principles \n Bill of Rights for the Planet \n Applications \n Examples \n Beauty and sustainable design \n Emotionally durable design \n Sustainable architecture \n Sustainable landscape and garden design \n Sustainable agriculture \n Domestic machinery and furniture \n Improvements to heating cooling ventilation and water heating \n Energy sector \n Design for sustainable manufacturing \n Water sector \n Terminology \n Sustainable technologies \n Theory \n The intention of sustainable design is to \"eliminate negative environmental impact completely through skillful sensitive design\" \n Manifestations of sustainable design require \n renewable resources \n impact the environment minimally and connect people with the natural environment \n Great design is sustainable design Rather than considering green building design as an externality architects must think about it as a set of principles for great design This includes better user experience and comfort doing more with less to enable the building to easily achieve peak performance and maximizing the effectives of durable quality materials Rather than the well-known edict form follows function its time to think form follows environment \n Beyond the \"elimination of negative environmental impact\" sustainable design must create projects that are meaningful innovations that can shift behaviour A dynamic balance between economy and society intended to generate long-term relationships between user and object/service and finally to be respectful and mindful of the environmental and social differences \n Conceptual problems \n Diminishing returns \n The principle that all directions of progress run out ending with diminishing returns is evident in the typical 'S' curve of the \n technology life cycle \n and in the useful life of any system as discussed in \n industrial ecology \n and \n life cycle assessment \n Diminishing returns are the result of reaching natural limits Common business management practice is to read diminishing returns in any direction of effort as an indication of diminishing opportunity the potential for accelerating decline and a signal to seek new opportunities elsewhere \n citation needed \n see also \n law of diminishing returns \n marginal utility \n and \n Jevons paradox \n Unsustainable investment \n A problem arises when the limits of a resource are hard to see so increasing investment in response to diminishing returns may seem profitable as in the \n Tragedy of the Commons \n but may lead to a collapse This problem of increasing investment in diminishing resources has also been studied in relation to the causes of civilization collapse by \n Joseph Tainter \n among others \n This natural error in investment policy contributed to the collapse of both the \n Roman \n and \n Mayan \n among others Relieving over-stressed resources requires reducing pressure on them not continually increasing it whether more efficiently or not \n Waste prevention \n Plans for Floriade in Venlo the Netherlands \"The Greenest Building in the Netherlands - no external fuel electricity water or sewage \" \n Negative Effects of Waste \n About million tonnes of waste in total are generated in the U K alone for example each year \n And with reference to only household waste between 1991/92 and 2007/08 each person in England generated an average of pounds of waste per day \n Experience has now shown that there is no completely safe method of waste disposal All forms of disposal have negative impacts on the environment public health and local economies Landfills have contaminated drinking water Garbage burned in incinerators has poisoned air soil and water The majority of water treatment systems change the local ecology Attempts to control or manage wastes after they are produced fail to eliminate environmental impacts \n The toxic components of household products pose serious health risks and aggravate the trash problem In the U S about eight pounds in every ton of household garbage contains toxic materials such as \n heavy metals \n like \n nickel \n lead \n cadmium \n and \n mercury \n from batteries and \n organic compounds \n found in pesticides and consumer products such as air freshener sprays nail polish cleaners and other products \n When burned or buried toxic materials also pose a serious threat to public health and the environment \n The only way to avoid environmental harm from waste is to prevent its generation Pollution prevention means changing the way activities are conducted and eliminating the source of the problem It does not mean doing without but doing differently For example preventing waste pollution from litter caused by disposable beverage containers does not mean doing without beverages it just means using refillable bottles \n Waste prevention strategies \n In planning for facilities a comprehensive design strategy is needed for preventing generation of solid waste A good garbage prevention strategy would require that everything brought into a facility be recycled for reuse or recycled back into the environment through \n biodegradation \n This would mean a greater reliance on natural materials or products that are compatible with the environment \n Any resource-related development is going to have two basic sources of solid waste materials purchased and used by the facility and those brought into the facility by visitors The following waste prevention strategies apply to both although different approaches will be needed for implementation \n use products that minimize waste and are nontoxic \n compost or anaerobically digest biodegradable wastes \n reuse materials onsite or collect suitable materials for offsite recycling \n consuming less resources means creating less waste therefore it reduces the impact on the environment \n Sustainable design principles \n The \n California Academy of Sciences \n San Francisco California is a sustainable building designed by Renzo Piano It opened on September \n One Central Park \n Sydney \n While the practical application varies among disciplines some common principles are as follows \n Low-impact materials choose non-toxic sustainably produced or recycled materials which require little energy to process \n Energy efficiency use manufacturing processes and produce products which require less energy \n Emotionally durable design \n reducing consumption and waste of resources by increasing the durability of relationships between people and products through design \n Design for reuse and \n recycling \n \"Products processes and systems should be designed for performance in a commercial 'afterlife' \" \n Design impact measures \n for total \n carbon footprint \n and life-cycle assessment for any resource used are increasingly required and available ^ \n Many are complex but some give quick and accurate whole-earth estimates of impacts One measure estimates any spending as consuming an average economic share of global energy use of 000BTU 400kJ per dollar and producing CO2 at the average rate of 57kg of CO2 per dollar dollars US from DOE figures \n Sustainable design standards \n and project design guides are also increasingly available and are vigorously being developed by a wide array of private organizations and individuals There is also a large body of new methods emerging from the rapid development of what has become known as 'sustainability science' promoted by a wide variety of educational and governmental institutions \n Biomimicry \n \"redesigning industrial systems on biological lines enabling the constant reuse of materials in continuous closed cycles \" \n Service substitution \n shifting the mode of consumption from personal ownership of products to provision of services which provide similar functions e g from a private automobile to a \n carsharing \n service Such a system promotes minimal resource use per unit of consumption e g per trip driven \n Renewability \n materials should come from nearby local or \n bioregional \n sustainably managed renewable sources that can be \n composted \n when their usefulness has been exhausted \n Robust eco-design \n robust design principles are applied to the design of a pollution sources \n The physics principle \n that accounts for the urge to have sustainability and for the evolutionary design in general is the \n constructal law \n Bill of Rights for the Planet \n A model of the new design principles necessary for \n sustainability \n is exemplified by the \"Bill of Rights for the Planet\" or \"Hannover Principles\" - developed by William McDonough Architects for EXPO that was held in \n Hannover Germany \n The Bill of Rights \n Insist on the right of humanity and nature to co-exist in a healthy supportive diverse and sustainable conditions \n Recognize Interdependence The elements of human design interact with and depend on the natural world with broad and diverse implications at every scale Expand design considerations to recognizing even distant effects \n Respect relationships between spirit and matter Consider all aspects of human settlement including community dwelling industry and trade in terms of existing and evolving connections between spiritual and material consciousness \n Accept responsibility for the consequences of design decisions upon human well-being the viability of natural systems and their right to co-exist \n Create safe objects of long-term value Do not burden future generations with requirements for maintenance or vigilant administration of potential danger due to the careless creations of products processes or standards \n Eliminate the concept of waste Evaluate and optimize the full life-cycle of products and processes to approach the state of natural systems in which there is no waste \n Rely on natural energy flows Human designs should like the living world derive their creative forces from perpetual solar income Incorporating this energy efficiently and safely for responsible use \n Understand the limitations of design No human creation lasts forever and design does not solve all problems Those who create and plan should practice humility in the face of nature Treat nature as a model and mentor not an inconvenience to be evaded or controlled \n Seek constant improvement by the sharing of knowledge Encourage direct and open communication between colleagues patrons manufacturers and users to link long term sustainable considerations with ethical responsibility and re-establish the integral relationship between natural processes and human activity \n These principles were adopted by the World Congress of the International Union of Architects UIA in June at the American Institute of Architects' AIA Expo in \n Chicago \n Further the AIA and UIA signed a \"Declaration of Interdependence for a Sustainable Future \" In summary the declaration states that today's society is degrading its environment and that the AIA UIA and their members are committed to \n Placing environmental and social sustainability at the core of practices and professional responsibilities \n Developing and continually improving practices procedures products services and standards for sustainable design \n Educating the building industry clients and the general public about the importance of sustainable design \n Working to change policies regulations and standards in government and business so that sustainable design will become the fully supported standard practice \n Bringing the existing built environment up to sustainable design standards \n In addition the Interprofessional Council on Environmental Design ICED a coalition of architectural landscape architectural and engineering organizations developed a vision statement in an attempt to foster a team approach to sustainable design ICED states The ethics education and practices of our professions will be directed to shape a sustainable future To achieve this vision we will join as a multidisciplinary partnership \" \n These activities are an indication that the concept of sustainable design is being supported on a global and interprofessional scale and that the ultimate goal is to become more environmentally responsive The world needs facilities that are more energy efficient and that promote conservation and recycling of natural and economic resources \n Applications \n Applications of this philosophy range from the \n microcosm \n small objects for everyday use through to the \n macrocosm \n buildings cities and the Earth's physical surface It is a philosophy that can be applied in the fields of \n architecture \n landscape architecture \n urban design \n urban planning \n engineering \n graphic design \n industrial design \n interior design \n fashion design \n and \n human-computer interaction \n Sustainable design is mostly a general reaction to global \n environmental crises \n the rapid growth of economic activity and human population depletion of natural resources damage to \n ecosystems \n and \n loss of biodiversity \n In eco architecture writer \n Bridgette Meinhold \n surveyed emergency and long-term sustainable housing projects that were developed in response to these crises in her book Urgent Architecture Sustainable Housing Solutions for a Changing World \n Featured projects focus on \n green building \n sustainable design \n eco-friendly \n materials \n affordability \n material reuse \n and \n humanitarian relief \n Construction methods and materials include repurposed \n shipping containers \n straw bale construction \n sandbag \n homes and \n floating homes \n The limits of sustainable design are reducing Whole earth impacts are beginning to be considered because growth in goods and services is consistently outpacing gains in efficiency As a result the net effect of sustainable design to date has been to simply improve the efficiency of rapidly increasing impacts The present approach which focuses on the efficiency of delivering individual goods and services does not solve this problem The basic dilemmas include the increasing complexity of efficiency improvements the difficulty of implementing new technologies in societies built around old ones that physical impacts of delivering goods and services are not localized but are distributed throughout the economies and that the scale of resource use is growing and not stabilizing \n Examples \n Beauty and sustainable design \n Because standards of sustainable design appear to emphasize ethics over aesthetics some designers and critics have complained that it lacks inspiration \n Pritzker Architecture Prize \n winner \n Frank Gehry \n has called green building \"bogus \" \n and \n National Design Awards \n winner \n Peter Eisenman \n has dismissed it as \"having nothing to do with architecture \" \n In \n The American Prospect \n asked whether \"well-designed green architecture\" is an \"oxymoron \" \n Others claim that such criticism of sustainable design is misguided A leading advocate for this alternative view is architect \n Lance Hosey \n whose book \n The Shape of Green Aesthetics Ecology and Design \n was the first dedicated to the relationships between sustainability and beauty Hosey argues not just that sustainable design needs to be aesthetically appealing in order to be successful but also that following the principles of sustainability to their logical conclusion requires reimagining the shape of everything designed creating things of even greater beauty Reviewers have suggested that the ideas in \n The Shape of Green \n could \"revolutionize what it means to be sustainable \" \n Small and large buildings are beginning to successfully incorporate principles of sustainability into award-winning designs Examples include \n One Central Park \n and the \n Science Faculty building UTS \n Emotionally durable design \n Stain Teacups Bethan Laura Wood \n According to \n Jonathan Chapman \n of the \n University of Brighton \n UK emotionally durable design reduces the consumption and waste of \n natural resources \n by increasing the resilience of relationships established between consumers and products \" \n Essentially product replacement is delayed by strong emotional ties \n In his book \n Emotionally Durable Design Objects Experiences & Empathy \n Chapman describes how \"the process of consumption is and has always been motivated by complex emotional drivers and is about far more than just the mindless purchasing of newer and shinier things it is a journey towards the ideal or desired self that through cyclical loops of desire and disappointment becomes a seemingly endless process of serial destruction\" \n Therefore a product requires an attribute or number of attributes which extend beyond utilitarianism \n According to Chapman 'emotional durability' can be achieved through consideration of the following five elements \n Narrative \n How users share a unique personal history with the product \n Consciousness \n How the product is perceived as autonomous and in possession of its own free will \n Attachment \n Can a user be made to feel a strong emotional connection to a product? \n Fiction \n The product inspires interactions and connections beyond just the physical relationship \n Surface \n How the product ages and develops character through time and use \n As a strategic approach \"emotionally durable design provides a useful language to describe the contemporary relevance of designing responsible well made tactile products which the user can get to know and assign value to in the long-term \" \n According to Hazel Clark and David Brody of \n Parsons The New School for Design \n in New York emotionally durable design is a call for professionals and students alike to prioritise the relationships between design and its users as a way of developing more sustainable attitudes to and in design things \n Play media \n Discussion by Julianna Osk Hafberg of Likka Fashion Brand at the Reykjavk Art Museum \n Sustainable architecture \n Sustainable architecture \n Sustainable building design \n Sustainable architecture is the design of \n sustainable buildings \n Sustainable architecture attempts to reduce the collective environmental impacts during the production of building components during the construction process as well as during the \n lifecycle \n of the building heating electricity use carpet cleaning etc This design practice emphasizes efficiency of heating and cooling systems \n alternative energy \n sources such as \n solar hot water \n appropriate building siting reused or recycled building materials on-site power generation - solar technology ground source heat pumps wind power \n rainwater harvesting \n for gardening washing and \n aquifer \n recharge and on-site \n waste management \n such as \n green roofs \n that filter and control stormwater runoff This requires close cooperation of the design team the architects the engineers and the client at all project stages from site selection scheme formation material selection and procurement to project implementation \n Sustainable architects design with \n sustainable living \n in mind \n Sustainable vs \n green design \n is the challenge that designs not only reflect healthy processes and uses but are powered by renewable energies and site specific resources A test for sustainable design is can the design function for its intended use without \n fossil fuel \n unplugged This challenge suggests architects and planners design solutions that can function without pollution rather than just reducing pollution As technology progresses in architecture and design theories and as examples are built and tested architects will soon be able to create not only passive null-emission buildings but rather be able to integrate the entire power system into the building design In the home housing community the \n Solar Settlement \n and a 000sqft 600m \n integrated retail commercial and residential building the \n Sun Ship \n were completed by architect \n Rolf Disch \n in \n Freiburg \n Germany \n The \n Solar Settlement \n is the first housing community worldwide in which every home all produce a positive energy balance \n An essential element of Sustainable Building Design is indoor environmental quality including air quality illumination thermal conditions and acoustics The integrated design of the indoor environment is essential and must be part of the integrated design of the entire structure ASHRAE Guideline 10-2011 addresses the interactions among indoor environmental factors and goes beyond traditional standards \n Concurrently the recent movements of \n New Urbanism \n and \n New Classical Architecture \n promote a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops \n smart growth \n architectural tradition \n and \n classical design \n This in contrast to \n modernist \n and \n globally uniform \n architecture as well as leaning against solitary \n housing estates \n and \n suburban sprawl \n Both trends started in the 1980s The \n Driehaus Architecture Prize \n is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist \n Pritzker Prize \n TACOS \n Sustainable landscape and garden design \n Main articles \n Sustainable landscape architecture \n Sustainable landscaping \n and \n Sustainable gardening \n Sustainable landscape architecture \n is a category of sustainable design and \n energy-efficient landscaping \n concerned with the planning and design of outdoor space Plants and materials may be bought from local growers to reduce energy used in transportation Design techniques include planting trees to shade buildings from the sun or protect them from wind using local materials and on-site composting and chipping not only to reduce \n green waste \n hauling but to increase \n organic matter \n and therefore \n carbon \n in the \n soil \n Some designers and gardeners such as \n Beth Chatto \n also use \n drought \n -resistant plants in arid areas \n xeriscaping \n and elsewhere so that water is not taken from local landscapes and \n habitats \n for \n irrigation \n Water from building roofs may be collected in \n rain gardens \n so that the \n groundwater \n is recharged instead of rainfall becoming \n surface runoff \n and increasing the risk of \n flooding \n Areas of the garden and landscape can also be allowed to grow wild to encourage \n bio-diversity \n Native animals may also be encouraged in many other ways by plants which provide food such as \n nectar \n and \n pollen \n for insects or roosting or nesting habitats such as trees or habitats such as \n ponds \n for \n amphibians \n and aquatic insects \n Pesticides \n especially \n persistent pesticides \n must be avoided to avoid killing wildlife \n Soil fertility can be managed sustainably by the use of many layers of vegetation from trees to \n ground-cover plants \n and \n mulches \n to increase \n organic matter \n and therefore \n earthworms \n and \n mycorrhiza \n nitrogen-fixing plants \n instead of \n synthetic nitrogen fertilizers \n and sustainably harvested \n seaweed extract \n to replace \n micronutrients \n Sustainable landscapes and gardens can be productive as well as ornamental growing food firewood and craft materials from beautiful places \n Sustainable landscape approaches and labels include \n organic farming \n and \n growing \n permaculture \n agroforestry \n forest gardens \n agroecology \n vegan organic gardening \n ecological gardening and \n climate-friendly gardening \n Sustainable agriculture \n Main \n Organic farming \n Sustainable agriculture \n adheres to three main goals \n Environmental Health \n Economic Profitability \n Social and Economic Equity \n A variety of philosophies policies and practices have contributed to these goals People in many different capacities from farmers to consumers have shared this vision and contributed to it Despite the diversity of people and perspectives the following themes commonly weave through definitions of sustainable agriculture \n There are strenuous discussions among others by the \n agricultural \n sector and authorities if existing pesticide protocols and methods of \n soil conservation \n adequately protect \n topsoil \n and \n wildlife \n Doubt has risen if these are sustainable and if \n agrarian reforms \n would permit an efficient \n agriculture \n with fewer \n pesticides \n therefore reducing the damage to the \n ecosystem \n For more information on the subject of sustainable agriculture \n \"UC Davis Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program\" \n Domestic machinery and furniture \n Home appliances \n Automobiles \n home appliances \n and \n furnitures \n can be designed for repair and disassembly for recycling and constructed from recyclable materials such as steel aluminum and glass and renewable materials such as \n Zelfo \n wood \n and plastics from natural feedstocks Careful selection of materials and manufacturing processes can often create products comparable in price and

bioenergy \n geothermal \n and \n hydrogen \n Wind energy is the world's fastest growing energy source it has been in use for centuries in \n Europe \n and more recently in the \n United States \n and other nations Wind energy is captured through the use of \n wind turbines \n that generate and transfer electricity for utilities homeowners and remote villages Solar power can be harnessed through \n photovoltaics \n concentrating solar or \n solar hot water \n and is also a rapidly growing energy source \n The availability potential and feasibility of primary renewable energy resources must be analyzed early in the planning process as part of a comprehensive energy plan The plan must justify energy demand and supply and assess the actual costs and benefits to the local regional and global environments Responsible energy use is fundamental to \n sustainable development \n and a sustainable future Energy management must balance justifiable energy demand with appropriate energy supply The process couples energy awareness energy conservation and energy efficiency with the use of primary renewable energy resources \n Design for sustainable manufacturing \n Sustainable manufacturing can be defined as the creation of a manufactured product through a concurrent improvement in the resulting effect on factory and product sustainability The concept of sustainable manufacturing demands a renewed design of \n production systems \n in order to condition the related \n sustainability \n on \n product life cycle \n and Factory operations \n Designing sustainable production systems imply on the one hand the analysis and optimization of intra-factory aspects that are related to \n manufacturing plants \n Such aspects can regard the \n resource consumption \n restrain the process \n efficiency \n the \n ergonomics \n for the factory workers the elimination of \n hazardous substances \n the minimization of factory emissions and waste as well as internal emissions the integrated management of information in the production facilities and the technological updating of machines and plants \n Other inter-factories aspects concern the sustainable design of manufactured products product chain \n dematerialisation \n management of the background and foreground \n supply chains \n support of \n circular economy \n paradigm and the \n labelling \n for sustainability \n Water sector \n Main articles \n Reclaimed water \n Rainwater harvesting \n and \n Stormwater harvesting \n A litre rainwater harvesting tank in \n Kerala \n Sustainable water technologies have become an important industry segment with several companies now providing important and scalable solutions to supply water in a sustainable manner \n Beyond the use of certain technologies Sustainable Design in Water Management also consists very importantly in correct implementation of concepts Among one of these principal concepts is the fact normally in developed countries 100% of water destined for consumption that is not necessarily for drinking purposes is of potable water quality This concept of differentiating qualities of water for different purposes has been called \"fit-for-purpose\" \n This more rational use of water achieves several economies that are not only related to water itself but also the consumption of energy as to achieve water of drinking quality can be extremely energy intensive for several reasons \n Terminology \n In some countries the term \n sustainable design \n is known as \n ecodesign \n green design \n or \n environmental design \n Victor Papanek \n embraced \n social design \n and social quality and ecological quality but did not explicitly combine these areas of design concern in one term \n Sustainable design \n and \n design for sustainability \n are more common terms including the \n triple bottom line \n people planet and profit \n citation needed \n In the EU the concept of sustainable design is referred to as ecodesign Little discussions have however taken place over the importance of this concept in the run-up to the \n circular economy \n package that the European Commission will be tabling by the end of To this effect an Ecothis EU campaign was launched to raise awareness about the economic and environmental consequences of not including eco-design as part of the circular economy package \n Sustainable technologies \n Sustainable technologies use less energy fewer limited resources do not deplete natural resources do not directly or indirectly pollute the environment and can be reused or recycled at the end of their useful life \n There is significant overlap with \n appropriate technology \n which emphasizes the suitability of technology to the context in particular considering the needs of people in developing countries However the most appropriate technology may not be the most sustainable one and a sustainable technology may have high cost or maintenance requirements that make it unsuitable as an \"appropriate technology \" as that term is commonly used \n Sustainable development portal \n Energy portal \n Design portal \n Active daylighting \n Active solar \n Agroforestry \n BREEAM \n

intended to handle 'seemingly intractable problems' \n such as outlined in \n sustainable development \n debates The method is mostly used for cities and urban settlements \n Circles of Sustainability and its treatment of the social domains of ecology economics politics and culture provides the empirical dimension of an approach called ' \n engaged theory \n ' Developing Circles of Sustainability is part of larger project called 'Circles of Social Life' using the same four-domain model to analyze questions of resilience adaptation security reconciliation It is also being used in relation to thematics such as 'Circles of Child Wellbeing' with World Vision \n The rationale for this new method is clear As evidenced by Rio+20 and the UN Habitat World Urban Forum in Napoli and Medellin sustainability assessment is on the global agenda \n However the more complex the problems the less useful current sustainability assessment tools seem to be for assessing across different domains economics ecology politics and culture \n For example the \n Triple Bottom Line \n approach tends to take the economy as its primary point of focus with the domain of the environmental as the key externality Secondly the one-dimensional quantitative basis of many such methods means that they have limited purchase on complex qualitative issues Thirdly the size scope and sheer number of indicators included within many such methods means that they are often unwieldy and resist effective implementation Fourthly the restricted focus of current indicator sets means that they do not work across different organizational and social settingscorporations and other institutions cities and communities \n Most indicator approaches such as the Global Reporting Initiative or ISO14031 have been limited to large corporate organizations with easily definable legal and economic boundaries Circles of Sustainability was developed to respond to those limitations \n Use of the method \n Global Compact Cities Programme \n Porto Alegre Vila Chocolato project \n Milwaukee water sustainability project \n Metropolis World Association of the Major Metropolises \n The Economist \n World Vision \n Domains and subdomains \n Economics \n Ecology \n Politics \n Culture \n Criticisms \n Notes \n The method began with a fundamental dissatisfaction with current approaches to \n sustainability \n and \n sustainable development \n which tended to treat economics as the core domain and ecology as an externality Two concurrent developments provided impetus a major project in Porto Alegre and a United Nations paper called \n Accounting for Sustainability \n Briefing Paper No The researchers developed a method and an integrated set of tools for assessing and monitoring issues of sustainability while providing guidance for project development \n The method was then further refined through projects in Melbourne and Milwaukee and through an ARC-funded cross-disciplinary project \n that partnered with various organizations including Microsoft Australia Fuji Xerox Australia the City of Melbourne World Vision UN-Habitat and most crucially Metropolis \n A further refining of the ecological index quadrant is underway in Canada The Canadian project is significant because it is developing an ongoing index that measures and scores the ecological footprints cities have on their surrounding ecosystems \n Use of the method \n The method is used by a series of global organizations including the \n United Nations Global Compact \n Cities Programme The World Association of Major Metropolises \n and \n World Vision \n to support their engagement in cities It is also used by a number of cities across the world in different ways to manage major projects or to provide feedback on their sustainability profiles e g Hyderabad Johannesburg Melbourne New Delhi So Paulo and Tehran It is a method for understanding \n urban politics \n and \n urban planning \n as well as for conducting \n sustainability \n analysis and profiling \n sustainable development \n Global Compact Cities Programme \n The methodology is made available by UN Global Compact Cities Programme for its engagement with its more than Signatory Cities In particular some of the Innovating Cities in the programme have influenced the development of the Circles of Sustainability method through their management of major projects some with intensity and others as a background feature They use a cross-sectoral and holistic approach for developing a response to self-defined seemingly intractable problems \n Porto Alegre Vila Chocolato project \n The Vila Chocolato project refers to the resettlement of approximately residents of the inner-city Vila Chocolato slum in \n Porto Alegre \n Brazil The resettlement project of Vila Chocolato commenced in in response to an imminent eviction of the community with community members seeking resources and support to resettle through the city of Porto Alegre's renown \n participatory budgeting \n system The lengthy preparation to resettle was led by a local cross-sectoral network group the Vila Chocolato Sustainability Network The group was initially instigated by the Regional Court TRF4 and consisted of the Vila Chocolato Residents Association local government departments federal agencies non-government organisations and the corporate sector The project was supported by the City of Porto Alegre through the municipalitys Local Solidarity Governance Scheme In the Vila Chocolatao resettlement project was recognised as a pilot project for the then new Cities Programme cross-sectoral model with City Hall assembling a Critical Reference Group to identify critical issues and joint solutions to those issues involved in the resettlement \n This long-standing collaborative project has been successful in rehousing a whole community of slum dwellers it has also effected a restructuring of how the city approaches slums The project ensured sustainability was built into the relocation through changes such as setting up of recycling depots next to existing slums and developing a formal recycling sorting facility in the new site Residencial Nova Chocolato linked to the garbage-collection process of the city an example of linking the sub-domains of emission and waste and organization and governance and establishing a fully resourced early childhood centre in the new community The Vila Chocolato Sustainability Network group continues to meet and work with the community post the resettlement This network-led model is now being utilized by the City of Porto Alegre with other informal settlements \n Milwaukee water sustainability project \n In Milwaukee Wisconsin United States of America wanted to address the issue of water quality in the city \n The Circles of Sustainability methodology became the basis for an integrated city project In the period of the application of the method 2009present there has been a rediscovery of the value of water from an industry and broader community perspective \n In Milwaukee won the United States Water Prize given by the Clean Water America Alliance as well as a prize from IBM Better Cities program worth $500 The community has also attracted some leading water treatment innovators and is establishing a graduate School of Freshwater Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee \n Metropolis World Association of the Major Metropolises \n The methodology was first used by Metropolis for \n Commission Managing Urban Growth \n This Commission which met across the period was asked to make recommendations for use by Metropoliss member cities on the theme of managing growth The Commission Report using the Circles of Sustainability methodology was published on the web in three languagesEnglish French and Spanishand is used by member cities as a guide to practice \n In the research team were invited by Metropolis to work with the Victorian Government and the Cities Programme on one of their major initiatives The methodology is central to the approach used by the Integrated Strategic Planning and Public-Private Partnerships Initiative organized by Metropolis for Indian Brazilian and Iranian cities A workshop was held in New Delhi July and senior planners from New Delhi Hyderabad and Kolkata used the two of the assessment tools in the Circles of Sustainability toolbox to map the sustainability of their cities as part of developing their urban-regional plans Other cities to use the same tools have been Tehran in relation to their mega-projects plan and So Paulo in relation to their macro-metropolitan plan \n Since the Cities Programme and Metropolis have worked together to refine the 'Circles of Sustainability' method to use with their respective member cities A Metropolis Taskforce was charged with further developing the method \n The Economist \n In \n The Economist \n invited \n Paul James \n Director of the UN Global Compact Cities Programme and Chetan Vedya Director National Institute of Urban Affairs India into a debate around the question of urban sustainability and metropolitan growth It led to over letters to the editor in direct response as well as numerous linked citations on other websites \n World Vision \n In recognising how much the two processes of urbanization and globalization were changing the landscape of poverty \n World Vision \n decided to shift its orientation towards urban settings Previously per cent of its projects had been in small rural communities The Circles of Sustainability method now underpins that reorientation and pilot studies are being conducted in India South Africa Lebanon Indonesia and elsewhere to refine the methodology for aid delivery in complex urban settings \n Domains and subdomains \n The Circles of Sustainability approach is explicitly critical of other domain models such as the \n triple bottom line \n that treat economics as if it is outside the social or that treat the environment as an externality It uses a four-domain model - economics ecology politics and culture In each of these domains there are subdomains \n Economics \n The economic domain is defined as the practices and meanings associated with the production use and management of resources where the concept of resources is used in the broadest sense of that word \n Production and resourcing \n Exchange and transfer \n Accounting and regulation \n Consumption and use \n Labour and welfare \n Technology and infrastructure \n Wealth and distribution \n Ecology \n The ecological domain is defined as the practices and meanings that occur across the intersection between the social and the natural realms focusing on the important dimension of human engagement with and within nature but also including the built-environment \n Materials and energy \n Water and air \n Flora and fauna \n Habitat and settlements \n Built-form and transport \n Embodiment and sustenance \n Emission and waste \n Politics \n The political is defined as the practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power such as organization authorization legitimation and regulation The parameters of this area extend beyond the conventional sense of politics to include not only issues of public and private governance but more broadly social relations in general \n Organization and governance \n Law and justice \n Communication and critique \n Representation and negotiation \n Security and accord \n Dialogue and reconciliation \n Ethics and accountability \n Culture \n The cultural domain is defined as the practices discourses and material expressions which over time express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning \n Identity and engagement \n Creativity and recreation \n Memory and projection \n Belief and ideas \n Gender and generations \n Enquiry and learning \n Wellbeing and health \n Criticisms \n The Circles of Sustainability method has had its primary operational testing in cities municipalities and international NGOs and apart from being used to develop the materiality process for FujiXerox does not appear to be used by any corporations \n

{"theme.id": 2, "title": "Sustainability science", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability_science", "depth": 1, "text": "Sustainability science \n Sustainability science \n has emerged in the 21st century as a new academic discipline \n This new field of science was officially introduced with a \"Birth Statement\" at the World Congress \"Challenges of a Changing Earth 2001\" in Amsterdam organized by the \n International Council for Science \n ICSU the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme \n IGBP \n the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change \n and the \n World Climate Research Programme \n WCRP \n The field reflects a desire to give the generalities and broad-based approach of sustainability a stronger analytic and scientific underpinning as it \n brings together scholarship and practice global and local perspectives from north and south and disciplines across the natural and social sciences engineering and medicine \n it can be usefully thought of as \n \"neither basic nor applied research but as a field defined by the problems it addresses rather than by the disciplines it employs it serves the need for advancing both knowledge and action by creating a dynamic bridge between the two \" \n The field is focused on examining the interactions between human environmental and engineered systems to understand and contribute to solutions for complex challenges that threaten the future of humanity and the integrity of the life support systems of the planet such as climate change biodiversity loss pollution and land and water degradation \n Sustainability science like \n sustainability \n itself derives some impetus from the concepts of \n sustainable development \n and \n environmental science \n Sustainability science provides a critical framework for sustainability \n while \n sustainability measurement \n provides the evidence-based quantitative data needed to guide \n sustainability governance \n Definition \n Broad objectives \n Knowledge structuring of issues \n Coordination of data \n Interdisciplinary approaches \n Journals \n List of sustainability science programs \n Further reading \n Definition \n Consensual definition of sustainability science is as elusive as the definition of \"sustainability\" or \"sustainable development\" As outlined by the Sustainability Science Program at Harvard University's Center for International Development sustainability science seeks to \n Advance basic understanding of the dynamics of human-environment systems to facilitate the design implementation and evaluation of practical interventions that promote sustainability in particular places and contexts and to improve linkages between relevant research and innovation communities on the one hand and relevant policy and management communities on the other \n A more broad-based definition is \n The cultivation integration and application of knowledge about Earth systems gained especially from the holistic and historical sciences such as geology ecology climatology oceanography coordinated with knowledge about human interrelationships gained from the social sciences and humanities in order to evaluate mitigate and minimize the consequences regionally and worldwide of human impacts on planetary systems and on societies across the globe and into the future that is in order that humans can be knowledgeable Earth stewards \n It has been noted that the new paradigm \n \"must encompass different magnitudes of scales of time space and function multiple balances dynamics multiple actors interests and multiple failures systemic faults \" \n Others take a much broader view of sustainability science emphasizing the need to analyze the root causes of the fundamental unsustainability of the prevailing economic system such as the emphasis on growth as key to solving political and social problems and advancying society's well-being In a article entitled \"Sustainability Science Needs to Include Sustainable Consumption \" published in Environment Science and Policy for Sustainable Development Halina Brown argues that sustainability science must include the study of the sociology of material consumption and the structure of consumerist society the role of technology in aggravating the unsustainable social practices as well as in solving the problems they create the macroeconomic theories that presuppose economic growth as a necessary condition for advancing societal well-being and others \n Broad objectives \n The case for making research and development an important component of sustainable development strategies was embraced by many international scientific organizations in the mid-1980s promoted by the Brundtland Commission's report \n Our Common Future \n in and noted in the \n Agenda \n plan that emerged from the \n United Nations Conference on Environment and Development \n in and further developed at the \n World Summit on Sustainable Development \n held in Johannesburg in \n The topics of the following sub-headings indicate recurring themes that are addressed in the literature of sustainability science \n Only in have the seminal papers and thinking of sustainability scientists been drawn together \n In a compendium of basic papers in this new discipline was published by Robert Kates with introduction by William Clark as Readings in Sustainability Science and Technology - an introduction to the key literature of sustainability science \n The Commentary by Halina Brown extensively expands the scope of that seminal publication \n This is work in progress The Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology was created as a collaboration of over scientists to provide peer-reviewed entries covering sustainability research and policy evaluations of technology \n Knowledge structuring of issues \n Knowledge structuring has been identified as an essential first step in the effort to acquire a comprehensive view of sustainability issues which are both complex and interconnected This is needed as a response to the requirements of academia industry and government \n Coordination of data \n The key research and data for sustainability are sourced from many scientific disciplines topics and organisations A major part of knowledge structuring will entail building up the tools that provide an overview of what is known Sustainability science can construct and coordinate a framework within which the vast amount of data can be easily accessed \n Interdisciplinary approaches \n The attempt by sustainability science to understand the integrated whole of planetary and human systems requires cooperation between scientific social and economic disciplines public and private sectors academia and government In short it requires a massive global cooperative effort and one major task of sustainability science is to assist integrated cross-disciplinary coordination \n

Outdoor water use \n Conserving water \n Sequestering water \n Waste \n Definition \n The three pillars of sustainability \n Circles of Sustainability image assessment - Melbourne \n Sustainable living is fundamentally the application of \n sustainability \n to lifestyle choice and decisions One conception of sustainable living expresses what it means in triple-bottom-line terms as meeting present ecological societal and economical needs without compromising these factors for future generations \n Another broader conception describes sustainable living in terms of four interconnected \n social \n domains economics ecology politics and culture In the first conception sustainable living can be described as living within the innate carrying capacities defined by these factors In the second or \n Circles of Sustainability \n conception sustainable living can be described as negotiating the relationships of needs within limits across all the interconnected domains of social life including consequences for future human generations and non-human \n species \n Sustainable design \n and \n sustainable development \n are critical factors to sustainable living Sustainable design encompasses the development of \n appropriate technology \n which is a staple of sustainable living practices \n Sustainable development in turn is the use of these technologies in infrastructure \n Sustainable architecture \n and \n agriculture \n are the most common examples of this practice \n The publication of \n Living the Good Life \n by \n Helen \n and \n Scott Nearing \n marked the beginning of the modern day sustainable living movement The publication paved the way for the \" \n back-to-the-land movement \n \" in the late 1960s and early 1970s \n The publication of \n Silent Spring \n by \n Rachel Carson \n marked another major milestone for the sustainability movement \n Donella Meadows \n wrote the international bestseller \n The Limits to Growth \n which reported on a study of long-term global trends in \n population \n economics \n and the \n environment \n It sold millions of copies and was translated into languages \n E F Schumacher \n published a collection of essays on shifting towards sustainable living through the appropriate use of technology in his book \n Small is Beautiful \n The \n United Nations \n held a series of conferences which focused on increasing sustainability within societies to conserve the Earth's natural resources The \n Earth Summit \n conferences were held in \n and \n the \n United Nations \n published \n Sustainable Consumption and Production Promoting Climate-Friendly Household Consumption Patterns \n which promoted sustainable lifestyles in communities and homes \n Shelter \n An example of ecological housing \n On a global scale shelter is associated with about 25% of the \n greenhouse gas \n emissions embodied in household purchases and 26% of households' \n land use \n Sustainable homes \n are built using sustainable methods materials and facilitate green practices enabling a more sustainable lifestyle Their construction and maintenance have neutral impacts on the Earth Often if necessary they are close in proximity to essential services such as grocery stores schools daycares work or public transit making it possible to commit to sustainable transportation choices \n Sometimes they are \n off-the-grid \n homes that do not require any public energy water or sewer service \n If not off-the-grid sustainable homes may be linked to a grid supplied by a power plant that is using sustainable power sources buying power as is normal convention Additionally sustainable homes may be connected to a grid but generate their own electricity through renewable means and sell any excess to a utility There are two common methods to approaching this option net metering and double metering \n Net metering uses the common meter that is installed in most homes running forward when power is used from the grid and running backward when power is put into the grid which allows them to net out their total energy use putting excess energy into the grid when not needed and using energy from the grid during peak hours when you may not be able to produce enough immediately Power companies can quickly purchase the power that is put back into the grid as it is being produced Double metering involves installing two meters one measuring electricity consumed the other measuring electricity created Additionally or in place of selling their renewable energy sustainable home owners may choose to bank their excess energy by using it to charge batteries This gives them the option to use the power later during less favorable power-generating times i e night-time when there has been no wind etc and to be completely independent of the \n electrical grid \n Sustainably designed see \n Sustainable Design \n houses \n are generally sited so as to create as little of a negative impact on the surrounding \n ecosystem \n as possible oriented to the sun so that it creates the best possible \n microclimate \n typically the long axis of the house or building should be oriented east-west and provide natural shading or wind barriers where and when needed among many other considerations The design of a sustainable shelter affords the options it has later i e using \n passive solar lighting and heating \n creating temperature buffer zones by adding porches deep overhangs to help create favorable microclimates etc \n Sustainably constructed houses involve environmentally friendly management of waste building materials such as recycling and composting use non-toxic and renewable recycled reclaimed or low-impact production materials that have been created and treated in a sustainable fashion such as using organic or water-based finishes use as much locally available materials and tools as possible so as to reduce the need for transportation and use low-impact production methods methods that minimize effects on the environment \n Many materials can be considered a green material until its background is revealed Any material that has used toxic or carcinogenic chemicals in its treatment or manufacturing such as \n formaldehyde \n in glues used in woodworking has traveled extensively from its source or manufacturer or has been cultivated or harvested in an unsustainable manner might not be considered green In order for any material to be considered green it must be resource efficient not compromise \n indoor air quality \n or \n water conservation \n and be energy efficient both in processing and when in use in the shelter \n Resource efficiency can be achieved by using as much recycled content reusable or recyclable content materials that employ recycled or recyclable packaging locally available material salvaged or remanufactured material material that employs resource efficient manufacturing and long-lasting material as possible \n Sustainable building materials \n Some building materials might be considered \"sustainable\" by some definitions and under some conditions For example wood might be thought of as sustainable if it is grown using \n sustainable forest management \n processed using \n sustainable energy \n delivered by \n sustainable transport \n etc Under different conditions however it might not be considered as sustainable The following materials might be considered as sustainable under certain conditions based on a \n Life-cycle assessment \n Adobe \n Bamboo \n Cellulose insulation \n Cob \n Composite wood when made from reclaimed hardwood sawdust and reclaimed or recycled plastic \n Compressed earth block \n Cordwood \n Cork \n Hemp \n Insulating concrete forms \n Lime render \n Linoleum \n Lumber from \n Forest Stewardship Council \n approved sources \n Natural Rubber \n Natural fiber \n coir \n wool \n jute \n etc \n Organic cotton insulation \n Papercrete \n Rammed Earth \n Reclaimed stone \n Reclaimed brick \n Recycled metal \n Recycled concrete \n Recycled paper \n Soy-based adhesive \n Soy insulation \n Straw Bale \n Structural insulated panel \n Wood \n Insulation \n of a sustainable home is important because of the energy it conserves throughout the life of the home Well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or in combination with a house that is well designed eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used Typically lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner For walls that do not have cavities behind them solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install \n Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation Simply assuring that windows and doors are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home \n Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out \n Low-emissivity \n or Low-E glass is another option for window insulation It is a coating on windowpanes of a thin transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer Simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation \n Superwindows mentioned in \n Natural Capitalism Creating the Next Industrial Revolution \n became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies including two to three transparent low-e coatings multiple panes of glass and a heavy gas filling Although more expensive they are said to be able to insulate four and a half times better than a typical double-glazed windows \n Equipping roofs with highly reflective material such as aluminum increases a roof's \n albedo \n and will help reduce the amount of heat it absorbs hence the amount of energy needed to cool the building it is on \n Green roofs \n or living roofs are a popular choice for thermally insulating a building They are also popular for their ability to catch storm-water runoff and when in the broader picture of a community reduce the heat island effect see \n urban heat island \n thereby reducing energy costs of the entire area It is arguable that they are able to replace the physical footprint that the building creates helping reduce the adverse environmental impacts of the buildings presence \n Energy efficiency and water conservation are also major considerations in sustainable housing If using appliances computers \n HVAC \n systems electronics or lighting the sustainable-minded often look for an \n Energy Star \n label which is government-backed and holds stricter regulations in energy and water efficiency than is required by law \n Ideally a sustainable shelter should be able to completely run the appliances it uses using renewable energy and should strive to have a neutral impact on the Earths water sources \n Greywater \n including water from washing machines sinks showers and baths may be reused in landscape irrigation and toilets as a method of water conservation Likewise \n rainwater harvesting \n from storm-water runoff is also a sustainable method to conserve water use in a sustainable shelter \n Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems \n replicate the natural systems that clean water in wildlife and implement them in a citys drainage system so as to minimize contaminated water and unnatural rates of runoff into the environment \n See related articles in \n LEED \n Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design \n Power \n Sustainable urban design \n and \n innovation \n Photovoltaic ombrire SUDI is an autonomous and mobile station that replenishes energy for electric vehicles using \n solar energy \n As mentioned under Shelter some sustainable households may choose to produce their own renewable energy while others may choose to purchase it through the grid from a power company that harnesses sustainable sources also mentioned previously are the methods of metering the production and consumption of electricity in a household Purchasing sustainable energy however may simply not be possible in some locations due to its limited availability out of the states in the US do not offer green energy for example For those that do its consumers typically buy a fixed amount or a percentage of their monthly consumption from a company of their choice and the bought green energy is fed into the entire national grid Technically in this case the green energy is not being fed directly to the household that buys it \n In this case it is possible that the amount of green electricity that the buying household receives is a small fraction of their total incoming electricity This may or may not depend on the amount being purchased The purpose of buying green electricity is to support their utilitys effort in producing sustainable energy \n Producing sustainable energy on an individual household or community basis is much more flexible but can still be limited in the richness of the sources that the location may afford some locations may not be rich in renewable energy sources while others may have an abundance of it \n When generating renewable energy and feeding it back into the grid in participating countries such as the US and Germany producing households are typically paid at least the full standard electricity rate by their utility and are also given separate renewable energy credits that they can then sell to their utility additionally utilities are interested in buying these renewable energy credits because it allows them to claim that they produce renewable energy In some special cases producing households may be paid up to four times the standard electricity rate but this is not common \n An installation of \n solar panels \n in rural Mongolia \n Solar power harnesses the energy of the sun to make electricity Two typical methods for converting solar energy into electricity are \n photo-voltaic cells \n that are organized into panels and \n concentrated solar power \n which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight to either heat a fluid that runs an \n electrical generator \n via a \n steam turbine \n or \n heat engine \n or to simply cast onto photo-voltaic cells \n The energy created by photo-voltaic cells is a \n direct current \n and has to be converted to \n alternating current \n before it can be used in a household At this point users can choose to either store this direct current in batteries for later use or use an AC/DC inverter for immediate use To get the best out of a solar panel the \n angle of incidence \n of the sun should be between and degrees Solar power via photo-voltaic cells are usually the most expensive method to harnessing renewable energy but is falling in price as technology advances and public interest increases It has the advantages of being portable easy to use on an individual basis readily available for government grants and incentives and being flexible regarding location though it is most efficient when used in hot arid areas since they tend to be the most sunny \n For those that are lucky affordable rental schemes may be found \n Concentrated solar power plants are typically used on more of a community scale rather than an individual household scale because of the amount of energy they are able to harness but can be done on an individual scale with a \n parabolic reflector \n Solar thermal energy \n is harnessed by collecting direct heat from the sun One of the most common ways that this method is used by households is through \n solar water heating \n In a broad perspective these systems involve well insulated tanks for storage and collectors are either passive or active systems active systems have pumps that continuously circulate water through the collectors and storage tank and in active systems involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used Passive systems are cheaper than active systems since they do not require a pumping system instead they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank \n Other methods of harnessing solar power are \n solar space heating \n for heating internal building spaces solar drying for drying wood chips fruits grains etc \n solar cookers \n solar distillers \n and other \n passive solar \n technologies simply harnessing sunlight without any mechanical means \n Wind power is harnessed through turbines set on tall towers typically or 6m with or 3m diameter blades for an individual households needs that power a generator that creates electricity \n They typically require an average of wind speed of 9mi/hr 14km/hr to be worth their investment as prescribed by the US Department of Energy and are capable of paying for themselves within their lifetimes Wind turbines in urban areas usually need to be mounted at least 10m in the air to receive enough wind and to be void of nearby obstructions such as neighboring buildings Mounting a wind turbine may also require permission from authorities Wind turbines have been criticized for the noise they produce their appearance and the argument that they can affect the migratory patterns of birds their blades obstruct passage in the sky Wind turbines are much more feasible for those living in rural areas \n and are one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy per kilowatt approaching the cost of fossil fuels and have quick paybacks \n For those that have a body of water flowing at an adequate speed or falling from an adequate height on their property \n hydroelectricity \n may be an option On a large scale hydroelectricity in the form of dams has adverse environmental and social impacts When on a small scale however in the form of single turbines hydroelectricity is very sustainable Single water turbines or even a group of single turbines are not environmentally or socially disruptive On an individual household basis single turbines are the probably the only economically feasible route but can have high paybacks and is one of the most efficient methods of renewable energy production It is more common for an eco-village to use this method rather than a singular household \n Geothermal energy production involves harnessing the hot water or steam below the earths surface in reservoirs to produce energy Because the hot water or steam that is used is reinjected back into the reservoir this source is considered sustainable However those that plan on getting their electricity from this source should be aware that there is controversy over the lifespan of each geothermal reservoir as some believe that their lifespans are naturally limited they cool down over time making geothermal energy production there eventually impossible This method is often large scale as the system required to harness geothermal energy can be complex and requires deep drilling equipment There do exist small individual scale geothermal operations however which harness reservoirs very close to the Earths surface avoiding the need for extensive drilling and sometimes even taking advantage of lakes or ponds where there is already a depression In this case the heat is captured and sent to a \n geothermal heat pump \n system located inside the shelter or facility that needs it often this heat is used directly to warm a greenhouse during the colder months \n Although geothermal energy is available everywhere on Earth practicality and cost-effectiveness varies directly related to the depth required to reach reservoirs Places such as the Philippines Hawaii Alaska Iceland California and Nevada have geothermal reservoirs closer to the Earths surface making its production cost-effective \n Biomass power is created when any biological matter is burned as fuel As with the case of using green materials in a household it is best to use as much locally available material as possible so as to reduce the carbon footprint created by transportation Although burning biomass for fuel releases \n carbon dioxide \n sulfur compounds and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere a major concern in a sustainable lifestyle the amount that is released is sustainable it will not contribute to a rise in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere This is because the biological matter that is being burned releases the same amount of carbon dioxide that it consumed during its lifetime \n However burning \n biodiesel \n and bioethanol see \n biofuel \n when created from virgin material is increasingly controversial and may or may not be considered sustainable because it inadvertently increases global poverty the clearing of more land for new agriculture fields the source of the biofuel is also the same source of food and may use unsustainable growing methods such as the use of environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers \n List of organic matter than can be burned for fuel \n Bagasse \n Biogas \n Manure \n Stover \n Straw \n Used vegetable oil \n Wood \n Digestion of organic material to produce methane is becoming an increasingly popular method of biomass energy production Materials such as waste sludge can be digested to release methane gas that can then be burnt to produce electricity Methane gas is also a natural by-product of landfills full of decomposing waste and can be harnessed here to produce electricity as well The advantage in burning methane gas is that is prevents the methane from being released into the atmosphere exacerbating the greenhouse effect Although this method of biomass energy production is typically large scale done in landfills it can be done on a smaller individual or community scale as well \n Food \n Globally food accounts for 48% and 70% of household environmental impacts on land and water resources respectively with consumption of meat dairy and processed food rising fast with income \n Environmental impacts of industrial agriculture \n Industrial agricultural production \n is highly resource and energy intensive Industrial agriculture systems typically require heavy \n irrigation \n extensive \n pesticide \n and \n fertilizer application \n intensive \n tillage \n concentrated \n monoculture \n production and other continual inputs As a result of these industrial farming conditions todays mounting environmental stresses are further exacerbated These stresses include declining \n water tables \n chemical \n leaching \n chemical \n runoff \n soil erosion \n land degradation \n loss in \n biodiversity \n and other ecological concerns \n Conventional food distribution and long distance transport \n Conventional \n food distribution and long distance transport are additionally \n resource \n and \n energy \n exhaustive Substantial climate-disrupting \n carbon emissions \n boosted by the transport of food over long distances are of growing concern as the world faces such \n global crisis \n as \n natural resource \n depletion \n peak oil \n and \n climate change \n The average American meal currently costs about miles and takes about \n calories \n of oil and other \n fossil fuels \n to produce a single calorie of food \n Local and seasonal foods \n A more sustainable means of acquiring food is to purchase locally and seasonally Buying food from local farmers reduces \n carbon output \n caused by long-distance food transport and stimulates the local economy \n Local small-scale farming operations also typically utilize more sustainable methods of agriculture than conventional industrial farming systems such as decreased tillage \n nutrient cycling \n fostered biodiversity and reduced chemical pesticide and fertilizer applications \n Adapting a more regional seasonally based diet is more sustainable as it entails purchasing less energy and resource demanding produce that naturally grow within a local area and require no long-distance transport These vegetables and fruits are also grown and harvested within their suitable \n growing season \n Thus \n seasonal food \n farming does not require energy intensive \n greenhouse \n production extensive irrigation plastic packaging and long-distance transport from importing non-regional foods and other environmental stressors \n Local seasonal produce is typically fresher unprocessed and argued to be more nutritious Local produce also contains less to no chemical residues from applications required for long-distance shipping and handling \n Farmers' markets \n public events where local small-scale farmers gather and sell their produce are a good source for obtaining local food and knowledge about local farming productions As well as promoting localization of food farmers markets are a central gathering place for community interaction \n Another way to become involved in regional food distribution is by joining a local \n community-supported agriculture \n CSA A CSA consists of a community of growers and consumers who pledge to support a farming operation while equally sharing the risks and benefits of food production CSA's usually involve a system of weekly pick-ups of locally farmed vegetables and fruits sometimes including dairy products meat and special food items such as baked goods \n Considering the previously noted rising environmental crisis the United States and much of the world is facing immense vulnerability to famine Local food production ensures food security if potential transportation disruptions and climatic economical and sociopolitical disasters were to occur \n Reducing meat consumption \n Industrial meat production also involves high environmental costs such as \n land degradation \n soil erosion \n and depletion of \n natural resources \n especially pertaining to water and food \n Mass meat production increase the amount of \n methane in the atmosphere \n For more information on the \n environmental impact of meat production \n and consumption see the \n ethics of eating meat \n Reducing meat consumption perhaps to a few meals a week or adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet alleviates the demand for environmentally damaging industrial meat production Buying and consuming organically raised \n free range \n or \n grass fed meat \n is another alternative towards more sustainable meat consumption \n Organic farming \n Purchasing and supporting organic products is another fundamental contribution to sustainable living \n Organic farming \n is a rapidly emerging trend in the food industry and in the web of sustainability According to the \n USDA \n National Organic Standards Board \n NOSB \n organic agriculture \n is defined as \"an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity biological cycles and soil biological activity It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore maintain or enhance ecological harmony The primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life plants animals and people \" Upon sustaining these goals organic agriculture uses techniques such as \n crop rotation \n permaculture \n compost \n green manure \n and \n biological pest control \n In addition organic farming prohibits or strictly limits the use of manufactured fertilizers and pesticides \n plant growth regulators \n such as \n hormones \n livestock \n antibiotics \n food additives \n and \n genetically modified organisms \n Organically farmed products include vegetables fruit grains herbs meat dairy eggs fibers and flowers See \n organic certification \n for more information \n Urban gardening \n \"Edible landscaping\" a vegetable garden incorporated by the local residents into a roadside park \n Qixia District \n Nanjing \n China \n In addition to local small-scale farms there has been a recent emergence in \n urban agriculture \n expanding from \n community gardens \n to private \n home gardens \n With this trend both farmers and ordinary people are becoming involved in \n food production \n A network of urban farming systems helps to further ensure regional food security and encourages self-sufficiency and cooperative interdependence within communities \n With every bite of food raised from urban gardens negative environmental impacts are reduced in numerous ways For instance vegetables and fruits raised within small-scale gardens and farms are not grown with tremendous applications of \n nitrogen fertilizer \n required for industrial agricultural operations The nitrogen fertilizers cause toxic chemical leaching and runoff that enters our water tables Nitrogen fertilizer also produces \n nitrous oxide \n a more damaging \n greenhouse gas \n than \n carbon dioxide \n Local community-grown food also requires no imported long-distance transport which further depletes our \n fossil fuel \n reserves \n In developing more efficiency per land acre urban gardens can be started in a wide variety of areas in vacant lots public parks private yards church and school yards on roof tops \n roof-top gardens \n and many other places Communities can work together in changing zoning limitations in order for public and private gardens to be permissible \n Aesthetically pleasing \n edible landscaping \n plants can also be incorporated into city landscaping such as blueberry bushes grapevines trained on an arbor pecan trees etc \n With as small a scale as home or community farming sustainable and organic farming methods can easily be utilized Such sustainable organic farming techniques include \n composting \n biological pest control \n crop rotation \n mulching \n drip irrigation \n nutrient cycling \n and \n permaculture \n For more information on sustainable farming systems see \n sustainable agriculture \n Food preservation and storage \n Preserving and storing foods reduces reliance on long-distance transported food and the market industry Home-grown foods can be preserved and stored outside of their growing season and continually consumed throughout the year enhancing self-sufficiency and independence from the supermarket Food can be preserved and saved by \n dehydration \n freezing \n vacuum packing \n canning \n bottling \n pickling \n and jellying \n For more information see \n food preservation \n Transportation \n Sustainable transport \n A \n carsharing \n plug-in hybrid \n vehicle being used to drop off \n compost \n at an urban facility in \n Chicago \n With rising \n peak oil \n concerns \n climate warming \n exacerbated by \n carbon emissions \n and high energy prices the conventional \n automobile industry \n is becoming less and less feasible to the conversation of sustainability Revisions of \n urban transport \n systems that foster mobility low-cost transportation and healthier urban environments are needed Such urban transport systems should consist of a combination of \n rail transport \n bus transport \n bicycle \n pathways and \n pedestrian \n walkways \n Public transport systems such as underground rail systems and bus transit systems shift huge numbers of people away from reliance on car \n mobilization \n and dramatically reduce the rate of carbon emissions caused by automobile transport \n Carpooling \n is another alternative for reducing oil consumption and carbon emissions by transit \n In comparison to automobiles bicycles are a paragon of energy efficient personal transportation with the bicycle roughly times more energy efficient than driving \n Bicycles increase mobility while alleviating \n congestion \n lowering \n air \n and \n noise pollution \n and increasing \n physical exercise \n Most importantly they do not emit climate-disturbing \n carbon dioxide \n Bike-sharing \n programs are beginning to boom throughout the world and are modeled in leading cities such as \n Paris \n Amsterdam \n and \n London \n Bike-sharing programs offer \n kiosks \n and docking stations that supply hundreds to thousands of bikes for rental throughout a city through small deposits or affordable memberships \n A recent boom has occurred in \n electric bikes \n especially in China and other Asian countries Electric bikes are similar to \n plug-in hybrid \n vehicles in that they are battery powered and can be plugged into the provincial \n electric grid \n for recharging as needed In contrast to plug-in hybrid cars electric bikes do not directly use any \n fossil fuels \n Adequate sustainable urban transportation is dependent upon proper city \n infrastructure \n and planning that incorporates efficient public transit along with bicycle and pedestrian-friendly pathways \n Patrick Maria Johnson was the founder of this \n Water \n This article \n appears to contradict the article \n Water efficiency \n Please see discussion on the linked \n talk page \n December \n Learn how and when to remove this template message \n Water efficiency \n A major factor of sustainable living involves that which no human can live without \n water \n Unsustainable water use has far reaching implications for humankind Currently humans use one-fourth of the earths total fresh water in natural circulation and over half the accessible \n runoff \n Additionally \n population growth \n and water demand is ever increasing Thus it is necessary to use available water more efficiently In sustainable living one can use water more sustainably through a series of simple everyday measures These measures involve considering indoor \n home appliance \n efficiency outdoor water use and daily water use awareness \n Indoor home appliances \n Housing and \n commercial buildings \n account for percent of Americas freshwater withdrawals \n A typical American single family home uses about US gallons 260L per person per day indoors \n This use can be reduced by simple alterations in behavior and upgrades to \n appliance \n quality \n Toilets \n Toilets \n accounted for almost 30% of residential indoor water use in the United States in \n One flush of a standard U S toilet requires more water than most individuals and many families in the world use for all their needs in an entire day \n A homes toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet To improve the current toilet one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank Also there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank A \n float booster \n attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye but can waste hundreds of gallons each month One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color In the event of a leaky flapper one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush \n If installing a new toilet there are a number of options to obtain the most water efficient model A \n low flush toilet \n uses one to two gallons per flush Traditionally toilets use three to five gallons per flush If an eighteen-liter per flush toilet is removed and a six-liter per flush toilet is put in its place 70% of the water flushed will be saved while the overall indoor water use by will be reduced by 30% \n It is possible to have a toilet that uses no water A \n composting toilet \n treats human waste through \n composting \n and \n dehydration \n producing a valuable soil additive \n These toilets feature a two-compartment bowl to separate urine from feces The urine can be collected or sold as fertilizer The feces can be dried and bagged or composted These toilets cost scarcely more than regularly installed toilets and do not require a sewer hookup In addition to providing valuable fertilizer these toilets are highly sustainable because they save sewage collection and treatment as well as lessen agricultural costs and improve \n topsoil \n Additionally one can reduce toilet water sustainability by limiting total toilet flushing For instance instead of flushing small wastes such as tissues one can dispose of these items in the trash or compost \n Showers \n On average showers were 18% of U S indoor water use in at US gallons 2330L per minute traditionally in America \n A simple method to reduce this use is to switch to low-flow high-performance showerheads These showerheads use only 0-1 gpm or less An alternative to replacing the showerhead is to install a converter This device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature \n Solar water heaters \n can be used to obtain optimal water temperature and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels To lessen excess water use water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation This insulation decreases hot water generation time A simple straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers One method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary such as while lathering and resuming the shower when water is necessary This can be facilitated when the plumbing or showerhead allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired temperature setting common in the UK but not the United States \n Dishwashers and sinks \n On average sinks were 15% of U S indoor water use in \n There are however easy methods to rectify excessive water loss Available for purchase is a screw-on aerator This device works by combining water with air thus generating a frothy substance with greater perceived volume reducing water use by half Additionally there is a flip-valve available that allows flow to be turned off and back on at the previously reached temperature Finally a \n laminar flow \n device creates a 5-2 gpm stream of water that reduces water use by half but can be turned to normal water level when optimal \n In addition to buying the above devices one can live more sustainably by checking sinks for leaks and fixing these links if they exist According to the EPA \"A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste gallons of water per day while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons\" \n When washing dishes by hand it is not necessary to leave the water running for rinsing and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously \n On average dishwashing consumes 1% of indoor water use \n When using a \n dishwasher \n water can be conserved by only running the machine when it is full Some have a \"low flow\" setting to use less water per wash cycle Enzymatic \n detergents \n clean dishes more efficiently and more successfully with a smaller amount of water at a lower temperature \n citation needed \n Washing machines \n On average 23% of U S indoor water use in was due to clothes washing \n In contrast to other machines American \n washing machines \n have changed little to become more sustainable A typical washing machine has a vertical-axis design in which clothes are agitated in a tubful of water Horizontal-axis machines in contrast put less water into the bottom of the rub and rotate clothes through it These machines are more efficient in terms of soap use and clothing stability \n Outdoor water use \n There are a number of ways one can incorporate a personal \n yard \n roof \n and \n garden \n in more sustainable living While conserving water is a major element of sustainability so is sequestering water \n Conserving water \n In planning a yard and garden space it is most sustainable to consider the plants soil and available water Drought resistant shrubs plants and grasses require a smaller amount of water in comparison to more traditional species Additionally native plants as opposed to herbaceous perennials will use a smaller supply of water and have a heightened resistance to plant diseases of the area \n Xeriscaping \n is a technique that selects drought-tolerant plants and accounts for endemic features such as \n slope \n soil type \n and \n native plant \n range It can reduce landscape water use by 70% while providing \n habitat \n space for wildlife Plants on slopes help reduce \n runoff \n by slowing and absorbing accumulated rainfall Grouping plants by watering needs further reduces water waste \n After planting placing a circumference of \n mulch \n surrounding plants functions to lessen \n evaporation \n To do this firmly press two to four inches of organic matter along the plant's dripline This prevents \n water runoff \n When watering consider the range of sprinklers watering paved areas is unnecessary Additionally to conserve the maximum amount of water watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation Drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system Drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period These systems use 50% less water than conventional methods \n Soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90% \n They connect to a garden hose and lay along the row of plants under a layer of mulch A layer of \n organic material \n added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention previously planted areas can be covered with \n compost \n In caring for a lawn there are a number of measures that can increase the sustainability of lawn maintenance techniques A primary aspect of lawn care is watering To conserve water it is important to only water when necessary and to deep soak when watering Additionally a lawn may be left to go dormant renewing after a dry spell to its original vitality \n Sequestering water \n A common method of water sequestrations is \n rainwater harvesting \n which incorporates the collection and storage of rain Primarily the rain is obtained from a roof and stored on the ground in catchment tanks Water sequestration varies based on extent cost and complexity A simple method involves a single barrel at the bottom of a downspout while a more complex method involves multiple tanks It is highly sustainable to use stored water in place of purified water for activities such as irrigation and flushing toilets Additionally using stored rainwater reduces the amount of runoff \n pollution \n picked up from roofs and pavements that would normally enter streams through storm drains The following equation can be used to estimate annual water supply \n Collection area square feet Rainfall inch/year / inch/foot = Cubic Feet of Water/Year \n Cubic Feet/Year Gallons/Cubic Foot = Gallons/year \n Note however this calculation does not account for losses such as evaporation or leakage \n Greywater \n systems function in sequestering used indoor water such as laundry bath and sink water and filtering it for reuse Greywater can be reused in \n irrigation \n and toilet flushing There are two types of greywater systems gravity fed manual systems and package systems \n The manual systems do not require electricity but may require a larger yard space \n The package systems require electricity but are self-contained and can be installed indoors \n Waste \n As populations and resource demands climb waste production contributes to \n emissions \n of \n carbon dioxide \n leaching of hazardous materials into the soil and waterways and \n methane emissions \n In America alone over the course of a decade trillion pounds of American resources will have been transformed into nonproductive wastes and gases \n Thus a crucial component of sustainable living is being waste conscious One can do this by reducing waste reusing commodities and recycling \n There are a number of ways to reduce waste in sustainable living Two methods to reduce paper waste are canceling junk mail like \n credit card and insurance offers \n and \n direct mail marketing \n and changing monthly paper statements to paperless emails Junk mail alone accounted for million tons of landfill waste in \n Another method to reduce waste is to buy in bulk reducing packaging materials Preventing food waste can limit the amount of organic waste sent to landfills producing the powerful greenhouse gas methane \n Another example of waste reduction involves being cognizant of purchasing excessive amounts when buying materials with limited use like cans of paint Non-hazardous or less hazardous alternatives can also limit the toxicity of waste \n By reusing materials one lives more sustainably by not contributing to the addition of waste to landfills Reusing saves \n natural resources \n by decreasing the necessity of \n raw material \n extraction For example reusable bags can reduce the amount of waste created by grocery shopping eliminating the need to create and ship plastic bags and the need to manage their disposal and recycling or polluting effects \n Recycling \n a process that breaks down used items into raw materials to make new materials is a particularly useful means of contributing to the renewal of goods Recycling incorporates three primary processes collection and processing manufacturing and purchasing recycled products \n A natural example of recycling involves using food waste as compost to enrich the quality of soil which can be carried out at home or locally with community \n composting \n An offshoot of recycling \n upcycling \n strives to convert material into something of similar or greater value in its second life \n By integrating measures of reusing reducing and recycling one can effectively reduce personal waste and use materials in a more sustainable manner \n Sustainable

positive \n impact on the environment \n society and economy \n Tourism can involve primary \n transportation \n to the general location local transportation accommodations entertainment recreation nourishment and shopping It can be related to \n travel \n for leisure business and what is called VFR visiting friends and relatives \n There is now broad consensus that tourism development should be sustainable however the question of how to achieve this remains an object of debate \n Without travel there is no \n tourism \n so the concept of \n sustainable \n tourism is tightly linked to a concept of \n sustainable mobility \n Two relevant considerations are tourism's reliance on fossil fuels and tourism's effect on climate change percent of tourism's CO \n emissions come from transportation percent from accommodations and percent from local activities \n Aviation \n accounts for 55% of those transportation CO \n emissions or 40% of tourism's total However when considering the impact of all greenhouse gas emissions from tourism and that aviation emissions are made at high altitude where their effect on climate is \n amplified \n aviation alone accounts for 75% of

both Airbus and Boeing expect the passenger-kilometers of air transport to increase by about percent yearly through at least overwhelming any efficiency gains By with other economic sectors having greatly reduced their \n CO \n emissions \n tourism is likely to be generating percent of global carbon emissions \n The main cause is an increase in the average distance travelled by tourists which for many years has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of trips taken \n \"Sustainable transportation is now established as the critical issue confronting a global tourism industry that is palpably unsustainable and aviation lies at the heart of this issue Gossling et al \" \n Social & economic aspects \n Stakeholders \n Governments \n Non-governmental organizations \n Local

continuous growth will place great stress on remaining biologically diverse \n habitats \n and \n indigenous \n cultures which are often used to support \n mass tourism \n Tourists who promote sustainable tourism are sensitive to these dangers and seek to protect tourist destinations and to protect tourism as an industry Sustainable tourists can reduce the impact of tourism in many ways \n informing themselves of the \n culture \n politics \n and \n economy \n of the communities visited \n anticipating and respecting local cultures expectations and assumptions \n supporting the integrity of local cultures by favoring businesses which conserve cultural heritage and traditional values \n supporting local economies by purchasing local goods and participating with small local businesses \n conserving resources by seeking out businesses that are environmentally conscious and by using the least possible amount of \n non-renewable resources \n Increasingly destinations and tourism operations are endorsing and following \"responsible tourism\" as a pathway towards sustainable tourism Responsible tourism and sustainable tourism have an identical goal that of \n sustainable development \n The pillars of responsible tourism are therefore the same as those of sustainable tourism environmental integrity social justice and economic development The major difference between the two is that in responsible tourism individuals organizations and businesses are asked to take responsibility for their actions and the impacts of their actions This shift in emphasis has taken place because some stakeholders feel that insufficient progress towards realizing sustainable tourism has been made since the \n Earth Summit \n in Rio This is partly because everyone has been expecting others to behave in a sustainable manner The emphasis on responsibility in responsible tourism means that everyone involved in tourism government product owners and operators transport operators community services \n NGOs \n and \n Community-based organization \n CBOs tourists local communities industry associations are responsible for achieving the goals of responsible tourism \n Stakeholders \n Stakeholders of sustainable tourism play a role in continuing this form of tourism This can include organizations as well as individuals to be specific ECOFIN \"A stakeholder in the tourism industry is deemed to be anyone who is impacted on by development positively or negatively and as a result it reduces potential conflict between the tourists and host community by involving the latter in shaping the way in which tourism develops \n The \n Global Sustainable Tourism Council \n GSTC serves as the international body for fostering increased knowledge and understanding of sustainable tourism practices promoting the adoption of universal sustainable tourism principles and building demand for sustainable travel It has a number of programmes including the setting of international standards for accreditation agencies the organisations that would inspect a tourism product and certify them as a sustainable company \n Governments \n The values and ulterior motives of governments often need to be taken into account when assessing the motives for sustainable tourism One important factor to consider in any ecologically sensitive or remote area or an area new to tourism is that of carrying capacity This is the capacity of tourists of visitors an area can sustainably tolerate without damaging the environment or culture of the surrounding area This can be altered and revised in time and with changing perceptions and values For example originally the sustainable carrying capacity of the \n Galapagos Islands \n was set at visitors per annum but was later changed by the Ecuadorian government to for economic reasons and objectives \n Non-governmental organizations \n Non-governmental organizations \n are one of the stakeholders in advocating sustainable tourism Their roles can range from spearheading sustainable tourism practices to simply doing research University research teams and scientists can be tapped to aid in the process of planning Such solicitation of research can be observed in the planning of \n Ct B National Park \n in \n Vietnam \n citation needed \n Dive resort operators in \n Bunaken National Park \n Indonesia \n play a crucial role by developing exclusive zones for \n diving \n and \n fishing \n respectively such that both tourists and locals can benefit from the venture \n citation needed \n Large \n conventions \n meetings \n and other major organized events drive the travel tourism and hospitality industry Cities and \n convention centers \n compete to attract such commerce commerce which has heavy impacts on resource use and the environment Major sporting events such as the \n Olympic Games \n present special problems regarding environmental burdens and degradation \n But burdens imposed by the regular convention industry can be vastly more significant \n Green conventions and events are a new but growing sector and marketing point within the convention and hospitality industry More environmentally aware organizations corporations and government agencies are now seeking more sustainable event practices greener hotels restaurants and convention venues and more energy efficient or climate neutral travel and ground transportation \n citation needed \n However the convention trip not taken can be the most sustainable option \"With most international conferences having hundreds if not thousands of participants and the bulk of these usually traveling by plane conference travel is an area where significant reductions in air-travel-related GHG emissions could be made This does not mean non-attendance\" Reay since modern Internet communications are now ubiquitous and remote audio/visual participation \n For example by \n Access Grid technology \n had already successfully hosted several international conferences \n A particular example is the large American Geophysical Union's annual meeting which has used livestreaming for several years This provides live streams and recordings of keynotes named lectures and oral sessions and provides opportunities to submit questions and interact with authors and peers \n Following the live-stream the recording of each session is posted on-line within hours \n Some convention centers have begun to take direct action in reducing the impact of the conventions they host One example is the \n Moscone Center \n in \n San Francisco \n which has a very aggressive \n recycling \n program a large \n solar power \n system and other programs aimed at reducing impact and increasing efficiency \n citation needed \n Local Communities \n Local communities benefit from sustainable tourism through economic development job creation and infrastructure development Tourism revenues bring economic growth and prosperity to attractive tourist destinations which can raise the standard of living in destination communities Sustainable tourism operators commit themselves to creating jobs for local community members Increase in tourism revenue to an area acts as a driver for the development of increased infrastructure As tourist demands increase in a destination a more robust infrastructure is needed to support the needs of both the tourism industry and the local community \n citation needed \n Sustainable Tourism in Developing Nations \n Play media \n Sustainable tourism in Sierra Leone \n A story of community tourism \n Playlist \n Expansion of Tourism in the LEDCs \n The renewed emphasis on outward-orientated growth which accompanied the rise in \n neoliberal \n development strategies in the 1990s in the south also focused attention on international tourism as an import potential growth sector for many countries particularly in \n LEDCs \n as many of the world's most beautiful and 'untouched' places are located in the \n Third World \n Prior to the 1960s studies tended to assume that the extension of the tourism industry to LEDCs was a good thing In the 1970s this changed as academics started to take a much more negative view on tourism's consequences particularly criticising the industry as an effective contributor towards development International tourism is a volatile industry with visitors quick to abandon destinations that were formerly popular because of threats to health or security \n Problems with sustainable tourism in the Third World \n Displacement and Resettlement \n One common issue with tourism in a place where there was none prior to First World companies arriving is that of the displacement and resettlement of local communities \n The \n Maasai \n tribes in Tanzania have been a victim of this problem After the second World War First World conservationists with the intent of making such areas accessible to tourists as well as preserving the areas natural beauty and ecology moved into the areas where the Maasai tribes lived This was often achieved through the setting up of national parks and conservation areas Monbiot \n Olerokonga \n It has been claimed that Maasai activities did not threaten the wildlife and the First World knowledge was blurred by ' \n colonial \n disdain' and misunderstandings of savannah wildlife \n As the Maasai have been displaced the area within the \n Ngorongoro Conservation Area \n NCA has been modified to allow easier access for tourists by actions such as building campsites tracks and the removal of stone objects such as stones for souvenirs \n This kind of 'sustainable tourism' is viewed by many as an oxymoron or metaphor since it seriously can't change anything There basically isn't a way we can make tourism sustainable but if all tourists put their heads together and work hard it could possibly work in a viable world that many things done in the name of sustainability are actually masking the desire to allow extra profits \n There is often alienation of local populations from the tourists \n Environmental Impacts \n environmental impact of tourism \n \"The environmental \n sustainability \n focuses on the overall viability and \n health of ecological systems \n Natural resource \n degradation \n pollution \n and \n loss of biodiversity \n are detrimental because they increase vulnerability undermine system health and reduce \n resilience \n This aspect of sustainability has been the most often discussed through the literature by numerous authors such as Hall C M & Lew A A Hall D Weaver and many others \" \n Coastal tourism \n Many \n coastal \n areas are experiencing particular pressure from growth in lifestyles and growing numbers of tourists \n Coastal environments \n are limited in extent consisting of only a narrow strip along the edge of the \n ocean \n Coastal areas are often the first environments to experience the detrimental impacts of tourism A detailed study of the impact on coastal areas with reference to western India can be an example \n The inevitable change is on the horizon as holiday destinations put more effort into sustainable tourism \n Planning \n and management controls can reduce the impact on coastal environments \n and ensure that investment into tourism products supports sustainable coastal tourism \n Some studies have led to interesting conceptual models applicable for coastal tourism The 'inverted funnel model' and the 'embedded model' Staju Jacob can be metaphors for understanding the interplay of different stake-holders like government local community tourists and business community in developing tourist destinations \n Mountain tourism \n Mount Everest \n attracts many tourist climbers wanting to summit the peak of the highest mountain in the world each year Everest is a \n UNESCO World Heritage \n site Over the years carelessness and excessive consumption of resources by mountaineers as well as \n overgrazing \n by livestock have damaged the habitats of \n snow leopards \n lesser pandas \n Tibetan bears \n and scores of bird species To counteract past abuses various \n reforestation \n programs have been carried out by local communities and the Nepalese government \n Expeditions have removed supplies and equipment left by climbers on Everests slopes including hundreds of oxygen containers A large quantity of the \n litter \n of past climberstons of items such as tents cans crampons and human wastehas been hauled down from the mountain and recycled or discarded However the bodies of most of the more than climbers who have died on Everest notably on its upper slopes have not been removed as they are unreachable orfor those that are accessibletheir weight makes carrying them down extremely difficult Notable in the cleanup endeavour have been the efforts of the Eco Everest Expeditions the first of which was organized in to commemorate the death that January of Everest-climbing pioneer Sir Edmund Hillary Those expeditions also have publicized ecological issues in particular concerns about the effects of climate change in the region through observations that the Khumbu Icefall has been melting \n Sustainable Tourism as part of a development strategy \n Third World countries are especially interested in international tourism \n and many believe it brings countries a large selection of economic benefits including employment opportunities small business development and increased in payments of foreign exchange Many assume that more money is gained through developing luxury goods and services in spite of the fact that this increases a countries dependency on imported products foreign investments and expatriate skills \n This classic 'trickle down' financial strategy rarely makes its way down to brings its benefits down to small businesses \n It has been said that the economic benefits of large-scale tourism are not doubted but that the backpacker or budget traveller sector is often neglected as a potential growth sector by Third World governments \n This sector brings significant non-economic benefits which could help to empower and educate the communities involved in this sector \"Aiming 'low' builds upon the skills of the local population promotes self-reliance and develops the confidence of community members in dealing with outsiders all signs of empowerment\" \n and all of which aid in the overall development of a nation \n Improvements to Sustainable Tourism in the Third World \n Management of Sustainable Tourism \n There has been the promotion of sustainable tourism practices surrounding the management of tourist locations by locals or the community This form of tourism is based on the premise that the people living next to a resource are the ones best suited to protecting it This means that the tourism activities and businesses are developed and operated by local community members and certainly with their consent and support Sustainable tourism typically involves the conservation of resources that are capitalized upon for tourism purposes Locals run the businesses and are responsible for promoting the conservation messages to protect their environment \n Community-based sustainable tourism CBST associates the success of the sustainability of the ecotourism location to the management practices of the communities who are directly or indirectly dependent on the location for their livelihoods A salient feature of CBST is that local knowledge is usually utilised alongside wide general frameworks of ecotourism business models This allows the participation of locals at the management level and typically allows a more intimate understanding of the environment \n citation needed \n The use of local knowledge also means an easier entry level into a tourism industry for locals whose jobs or livelihoods are affected by the use of their environment as tourism locations Environmentally sustainable development crucially depends on the presence of local support for a project \n It has also been noted that in order for success projects must provide direct benefits for the local community \n However recent research has found that economic linkages generated by CBST may only be sporadic and that the linkages with agriculture are negatively affected by seasonality and by the small scale of the cultivated areas This means that CBST may only have small-scale positive effects for these communities \n It has also been said that partnerships between governments and tourism agencies with smaller communities is not particularly effective because of the disparity in aims between the two groups i e true sustainability versus mass tourism for maximum profit In Honduras such a divergence can be demonstrated where consultants from the World Bank and officials from the Institute of tourism wanted to set up a selection of 5-star hotels near various \n ecotourism \n destinations But another operating approach in the region by USAID and APROECOH an ecotourism association promotes community-based efforts which has trained many local Hondurans Mader \n concluded that the grassroot organisations were more successful in Honduras \n Confusion surrounding Governmental Management of Sustainable Tourism \n There has been some discussion regarding the told of inter-governmental organisations and the development of sustainable tourism practices in the third world In Mowforth and Munt's book 'Tourism and Sustainability New Tourism in the Third World they criticised a document that was written by the World Travel and Tourism Council WTTC the World Tourism Organisation and the Earth Council which was included in Agenda It was entitled 'Agenda for the Travel and Tourism Industry Towards Environmentally Sustainable Development' Mowforth and Munt commented on the language used to describe the environment and local culture in such documents because the preservation of the environment and local culture are the two main objectives when practising sustainable tourism They pointed out that some of the key words used were 'core asset' 'core product' 'product quality' and 'preserve' \n They argued that the treatment of the environment as a marketable product was clear and that such documents provide a good list of advice for Third World governments regarding sustainable tourism but do not actually provide the resources to incorporate them into the development of their tourism industries \n It is arguments such as these that postulate that there is a gap between the advice given by non-governmental or inter-governmental organisations to Third World governments and what can actually be brought to realisation These arguments try and persuade readers that documents like the one released by the WTTC that the development of sustainable tourism actually 'bypasses the interests of local people' \n Responsible tourism \n Responsible tourism is regarded as a behaviour It is more than a form of tourism as it represents an approach to engaging with tourism be that as a tourist a business locals at a destination or any other tourism stakeholder It emphasizes that all stakeholders are responsible for the kind of tourism they develop or engage in Whilst different groups will see responsibility in different ways the shared understanding is that responsible tourism should entail an improvement in tourism Tourism should become better as a result of the responsible tourism approach \n citation needed \n Within the notion of betterment resides the acknowledgement that conflicting interests need to be balanced However the objective is to create better places for people to live in and to visit Importantly there is no blueprint for responsible tourism what is deemed responsible may differ depending on places and cultures Responsible Tourism is an aspiration that can be realized in different ways in different originating markets and in the diverse destinations of the world Goodwin \n citation needed \n Focusing in particular on businesses according to the Cape Town Declaration on Responsible Tourism it will have the following characteristics \n minimises negative economic environmental and social impacts \n generates greater economic benefits for local people and enhances the well-being of host communities improves working conditions and access to the industry \n involves local people in decisions that affect their lives and life chances \n makes positive contributions to the conservation of natural and cultural heritage to the maintenance of the worlds diversity \n provides more enjoyable experiences for tourists through more meaningful connections with local people and a greater understanding of local cultural social and environmental issues \n provides access for people with disabilities and \n is culturally sensitive engenders respect between tourists and hosts and builds local pride and confidence \n Sustainable tourism is where tourists can enjoy their holiday and at the same time respect the culture of people and also respect the environment It also means that local people such as the Masaai get a fair say about tourism and also receive some money from the profit which the game reserve make The environment is being damaged quite a lot by tourists and part of Sustainable tourism is to make sure that the damaging does not carry on \n citation needed \n There are many private companies who are working into embracing the principles and aspects of Responsible Tourism some for the purpose of \n Corporate Social Responsibility \n activities and others such as SustainableVisit \n responsibletravel com \n FairTravelR and WorldHotel-Link which was originally a project of the \n International Finance Corporation \n have built their entire business model around responsible tourism local capacity building and increasing market access for small and medium tourism enterprises \n citation needed \n Humane tourism \n Humane tourism is part of the movement of \n responsible tourism \n The idea is to empower local communities through travel related businesses around the world first and foremost in \n developing countries \n The idea of humane travel or humane \n tourism \n is to connect travelers from \n Europe \n North America \n Australia \n and \n New Zealand \n seeking new adventures and authentic experiences directly to local businesses in the specific locations they wish to visit thus giving economic advantages to local businesses and giving travelers authentic and truly unique travel experiences Humane travel or humane tourism focuses on the people the local community The idea is to enable travelers to experience the world through the eyes of its local people while contributing directly to those people ensuring that tourist dollars benefit the local community directly \n citation needed \n Humane tourism is about giving opportunity to the local people empower them enable them to enjoy the fruits of tourism directly The \n Internet \n is changing tourism More and more travelers are planning their travels and vacations via the net The Internet enables people to cut off commissions The traveler can search for new destinations to visit talk or read about other people experience and buy the services directly The Internet platform can encourage local people to start new businesses and that already existing small businesses will begin to promote themselves through the net and receive the economic advantages of this directly in their communities The world is now in a new tourism age with globalization and the Internet playing a key role \n citation needed \n The new travelers have traveled the world they have seen the classic sites Staying at a Western hotel is not attractive enough and they are excited by the prospect of experiencing the authentic local way of life to go fishing with a local fisherman to eat the fish with his family to sleep in a typical village house These tourists or travelers are happy to know that while doing so they promote the economic well-being of those same people they spend time with \n citation needed \n Humane tourism is part of Responsible tourism The concept of Responsible Tourism originated in the work of Jost Krippendorf in The Holiday Makers \n called for rebellious tourists and rebellious locals to create new forms of tourism His vision was to develop and promote new forms of tourism which will bring the greatest possible benefit to all the participants travelers the host population and the tourist business without causing intolerable ecological and social damage As one can see he already talked back in the 80s about benefits for the host population and used the term human tourism Humane travel focuses on that host local population \n The \n South African \n national tourism policy \n used the term \"responsible tourism\" and mentioned the well-being of the local community as a main factor \n The \n Cape Town \n Declaration on Responsible Tourism in Destinations \n agreed in that Responsible Tourism is about making better places for people to live in and better places for people to visit The declaration focused on \"places\" but did mention the local population \n From the \n Rio \n summit or earth summit on \n until the \n UN \n Commission on Sustainable Development in \n the main focus of the tourism industry was the earth the planet the places \"green\" or \"eco\" tourism Now there is a trend to include the local population This trend or branch of responsible tourism is called humane tourism or humane travel \n Responsible hospitality \n As with the view of responsible tourism responsible hospitality is essentially about creating better places for people to live in and better places for people to visit This does not mean all forms of hospitality are also forms of tourism although hospitality is the largest sector of the tourism industry As such we should not be surprised at overlaps between responsible hospitality and responsible tourism In the instance where place of permanent residence is also the place where the hospitality service is consumed if for example a meal is consumed in a local restaurant this does not obviate the requirement to improve the place of residence As such the essence of Responsible Hospitality is not contingent upon touristic forms of hospitality \n citation needed \n While Friedman \n famously argued that admittedly within legal parameters the sole responsibility of business was to generate profit for shareholders the idea that businesses responsibility extends beyond this has existed for decades and is most frequently encountered in the concept of \n corporate social responsibility \n There are numerous ways businesses can and do engage in activities that are not intended to benefit shareholders and management at least not in the short term However often acts of corporate social responsibility are undertaken because of the perceived benefit to business Usually in hospitality this relates to the cost reductions associated with improved energy efficiency \n but may also relate to for example the rise in \n ethical consumerism \n and the view that being seen to be a responsible business is beneficial to revenue growth \n As per the Cape Town Declaration on Responsible Tourism responsible hospitality is culturally sensitive Instead of then calling for the unachievable responsible hospitality simply makes the case for more responsible forms of hospitality hospitality that benefits locals first and visitors second Certainly all forms of hospitality can be improved and managed so that negative impacts are minimized whilst striving for a maximization of positive impacts on the environment \n Hospitality Education \n Ministry of Tourism Government of India has mentioned that some of the hospitality management/ culinary training institutes in India will no longer make it mandatory for students to engage in non-vegetarian cooking The student will be given an option to choose vegetarian cooking IHMCTAN Ahmedabad IHMCTAN Bhopal and IHMCTAN Jaipur are the hospitality training institutes that offer a vegetarian choice and this practice will be extended to all IHMCTANs \n Fundamental research was presented in the

the distance \n food \n is \n transported \n from the time of its production until it reaches the \n consumer \n Food miles are one factor used when assessing the \n environmental \n impact of food including the impact on \n global warming \n The concept of food miles originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom It was conceived by Professor Tim Lang \n at the Sustainable Agriculture Food and Environment SAFE Alliance \n and first appeared in print in a report The Food Miles Report The dangers of long-distance food transport researched and written by Angela Paxton \n Some scholars believe that an increase in the distance food travels is due to the \n globalization \n of trade the focus of food supply bases into fewer larger districts drastic changes in delivery patterns the increase in processed and packaged foods and making fewer trips to the supermarket At the same time most of the \n greenhouse gas \n emissions created by food have their origin in the production phases which create 83% of overall emissions of CO \n A range of studies compare emissions over the entire food cycle including production consumption and transport \n These include estimates of food-related emissions of greenhouse gas 'up to the farm gate' versus 'beyond the farm gate' In the UK for example agricultural-related emissions may account for approximately 40% of the overall food chain including retail packaging fertilizer manufacture and other factors whereas greenhouse gases emitted in transport account for around 12% of overall food-chain emissions \n Researchers are currently working to provide the public with more information \n The concept of \"food miles\" has been criticised and food miles are not always correlated with the actual environmental impact of food production In comparison the percentage of total energy used in home food preparation is 26% and in food processing is 29% \n Overview \n Food miles in business \n Calculating food miles \n Criticism \n Fair trade \n Energy used in production as well as transport \n Intensive livestock production as a source of greenhouse gases \n \"Local\" food miles \n Lifecycle analysis rather than food miles \n Overview \n The concept of food miles is part of the broader issue of \n sustainability \n which deals with a large range of environmental social and economic issues including \n local food \n The term was coined by Tim Lang now Professor of Food Policy \n City University London \n who says \"The point was to highlight the hidden ecological social and economic consequences of food production to consumers in a simple way one which had objective reality but also connotations \" \n The increased distance traveled by food in developed countries was caused by the globilization of food trade which increased by times since \n Food that is transported by road produces more carbon emissions than any other form of transported food Road transport produces 60% of the world's food transport carbon emissions Air transport produces 20% of the world's food transport carbon emissions Rail and sea transport produce 10% each of the world's food transport carbon emissions \n Although it was never intended as a complete measure of environmental impact it has come under attack as an ineffective means of finding the true environmental impact For example a \n DEFRA \n report in undertaken by researchers at \n AEA Technology \n Environment entitled \n The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development \n included findings that \"the direct environmental social and economic costs of food transport are over billion each year and are dominated by congestion \" \n The report also indicates that it is not only how far the food has travelled but the method of travel in all parts of the food chain that is important to consider Many trips by personal cars to shopping centres would have a negative environmental impact compared to transporting a few truckloads to neighbourhood stores that can be easily reached by walking or cycling More emissions are created by the drive to the supermarket to buy air freighted food than was created by the air freighting in the first place \n Also the positive environmental effects of \n organic farming \n may be compromised by increased \n transportation \n unless it is produced by local \n farms \n The \n Carbon Trust \n notes that to understand the carbon emissions from food production all the carbon-emitting processes that occur as a result of getting food from the field to our plates need to be considered including production origin seasonality and home care \n Food miles in business \n A recent study led by Professor Miguel Gomez Applied Economics and Management at \n Cornell University \n and supported by the \n Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future \n found that in many instances the supermarket supply chain did much better in terms of food miles and fuel consumption for each pound compared to farmers markets It suggests that selling local foods through supermarkets may be more economically viable and sustainable than through farmers markets \n Calculating food miles \n With processed foods that are made of many different ingredients it is very complicated though not impossible to calculate the CO2 emissions from transport by multiplying the distance travelled of each ingredient by the carbon intensity of the mode of transport air road or rail However as both Prof Lang and the original Food Miles report noted the resulting number although interesting cannot give the whole picture of how sustainable or not a food product is \n Wal-Mart publicized a press releasing that stated food traveled miles before it reaches customers The shocking statistics aroused public concern about food miles According to Jane Black a food writer who covers food politics the number was derived from a small database The terminal markets from which the data was collected handled 30% of the United States produce \n Criticism \n Fair trade \n According to Oxfam researchers there are many other aspects of the agricultural processing and the food \n supply chain \n that also contribute to \n greenhouse gas \n emissions which are not taken into account by simple \"food miles\" measurements \n There are benefits to be gained by improving livelihoods in poor countries through agricultural development Smallholder farmers in poor countries can often improve their income and standard of living if they can sell to distant export markets for higher value horticultural produce moving away from the subsistence agriculture of producing staple crops for their own consumption or local markets \n However exports from poor countries do not always benefit poor people Unless the product has a Fairtrade label or a label from another robust and independent scheme food exports might make a bad situation worse Only a very small percentage of what importers pay will end up in the hands of plantation workers \n Wages are often very low and working conditions bad and sometimes dangerous Sometimes the food grown for export takes up land that had been used to grow food for local consumption so local people can go hungry \n Energy used in production as well as transport \n Researchers say a more complete environmental assessment of food that consumers buy needs to take into account how the food has been produced and what \n energy \n is used in its production A recent DEFRA case study indicated that \n tomatoes \n grown in \n Spain \n and transported to the \n United Kingdom \n may have a lower carbon footprint in terms of \n energy efficiency \n than tomatoes grown in heated \n greenhouses \n in the United Kingdom \n According to German researchers the food miles concept misleads consumers because the size of transportation and production units is not taken into account Using the methodology of \n Life Cycle Assessment LCA \n in accordance with \n ISO \n entire supply chains providing German consumers with food were investigated comparing local food with food of European and global provenance Large-scale agriculture reduces unit costs associated with food production and transportation leading to increased efficiency and decreased energy use per kilogram of food by \n economies of scale \n Research from the \n Justus Liebig University Giessen \n show that small food production operations may cause even more environmental impact than bigger operations in terms of \n energy use \n per kilogram even though food miles are lower Case studies of lamb beef wine apples fruit juices and pork show that the concept of food miles is too simple to account for all factors of food production \n A research report from the Agribusiness and Economics Research Unit at \n Lincoln University New Zealand \n counters claims about food miles by comparing total energy used in \n food production \n in \n Europe \n and \n New Zealand \n taking into account energy used to ship the food to Europe for consumers \n The report states \"New Zealand has greater production efficiency in many food commodities compared to the UK For example New Zealand \n agriculture \n tends to apply fewer \n fertilizers \n which require large amounts of energy to produce and cause significant \n CO2 emissions \n and animals are able to \n graze \n year round outside eating grass instead of large quantities of brought-in \n feed \n such as \n concentrates \n In the case of \n dairy \n and \n sheep meat \n production NZ is by far more \n energy efficient \n even including the transport cost than the UK twice as efficient in the case of dairy and four times as efficient in case of sheep meat \n In the case of \n apples \n NZ is more energy-efficient even though the energy embodied in capital items and other inputs data was not available for the UK \" \n Other researchers have contested the claims from New Zealand Professor Gareth Edwards-Jones has said that the arguments in favour of New Zealand apples shipped to the UK is probably true only or about two months a year during July and August when the carbon footprint for locally grown fruit doubles because it comes out of cool stores \n Studies by Dr Christopher Weber et al of the total \n carbon footprint \n of food production in the U S have shown transportation to be of minor importance compared to the carbon emissions resulting from pesticide and fertilizer production and the fuel required by farm and food processing equipment \n Intensive livestock production as a source of greenhouse gases \n Farm animals account for between 20% and 30% of global \n greenhouse gas \n emissions \n That figure includes the clearing of land to feed and graze the animals Clearing land of trees and cultivation are the main drivers of farming emissions \n Deforestation \n eliminates \n carbon sinks \n accelerating the process of \n climate change \n Cultivation including the use of \n synthetic fertilisers \n releases greenhouse gases such as \n nitrous oxide \n Nitrogen fertiliser \n is especially demanding of \n fossil fuels \n as producing a tonne of it takes tonnes of oil \n Meanwhile its increasingly recognised that \n meat \n and \n dairy \n are the largest sources of food-related emissions The UKs consumption of meat and dairy products including imports accounts for about 8% of national \n greenhouse gas emissions \n related to consumption \n According to a study by engineers Christopher Weber and H Scott Matthews of \n Carnegie Mellon University \n of all the greenhouse gases emitted by the food industry only 4% comes from transporting the food from producers to retailers The study also concluded that adopting a \n vegetarian diet \n even if the vegetarian food is transported over very long distances does far more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than does eating a locally grown diet \n They also concluded that \"Shifting less than one day per weeks worth of calories from \n red meat \n and \n dairy products \n to chicken fish eggs or a vegetable-based diet achieves more GHG reduction than buying all locally sourced food \" In other words the amount of red meat consumption is much more important than food miles \n \"Local\" food miles \n A commonly ignored element is the local loop For example a gallon of gasoline could transport 5kg of meat over miles 000km by road tonner at mpg in \n bulk transport \n or it could transport a single consumer only or miles 64km to buy that meat Thus foods from a distant farm that are transported in bulk to a nearby store consumer can have a lower footprint than foods a consumer picks up directly from a farm that is within driving distance but farther away than the store This can mean that doorstep deliveries of food by companies can lead to lower carbon emissions or energy use than normal shopping practices \n Relative distances and mode of transportation make this calculation complicated For example consumers can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of their part of the journey by walking bicycling or taking public transport Another impact is that goods being transported by large ships very long distances can have lower associated carbon emissions or energy use than the same goods traveling by truck a much shorter distance \n Lifecycle analysis rather than food miles \n Lifecycle analysis \n a technique that meshes together a wide range of different environmental criteria including emissions and waste is a more holistic way of assessing the real environmental impact of the food we eat The technique accounts for energy input and output involved in the production processing packaging and transport of food It also factors in \n resource depletion \n air pollution \n and \n water pollution \n and waste generation/ \n municipal solid waste \n A number of organisations are developing ways of calculating the carbon cost or lifecycle impact of food and agriculture \n Some are more robust than others but at the moment there is no easy way to tell which ones are thorough independent and reliable and which ones are just marketing hype \n Even a full lifecycle analysis accounts only for the environmental effects of food production and consumption However it is one of the widely agreed three pillars of sustainable development namely environmental social and economic"},
{"theme.id": 2, "title": "Sustainable capitalism", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Capitalism", "depth": 1, "text": "Sustainable capitalism \n Redirected from \n Sustainable Capitalism \n Sustainable capitalism \n is a conceptual form of \n capitalism \n based upon \n sustainable \n practices that seek to preserve humanity and the planet while reducing \n externalities \n and bearing a resemblance of capitalist \n economic policy \n A capitalistic economy must expand to survive and find new markets to support this expansion \n Capitalist systems are often thought to be destructive to the environment as well as certain individuals without access to proper representation However sustainability provides quite the opposite it implies not only a continuation but a replenishing of resources \n Sustainability is often thought of to be related to \n environmentalism \n and sustainable capitalism applies sustainable principles to economic governance and social aspects of capitalism as well \n The importance of sustainable capitalism has been more recently recognized but the concept is not new Changes to the current economic model would have heavy social environmental and economic implications and require the efforts of individuals as well as compliance of local state and federal governments Controversy surrounds the concept as it requires an increase in sustainable practices and a marked decrease in current consumptive behaviors \n This is a concept of \n capitalism \n described in \n Al Gore \n and \n David Blood \n s manifesto for the \n Generation Investment Management \n to describe a long-term political economic and social structure which would mitigate current threats to the planet and society \n According to their manifesto sustainable capitalism would integrate the environmental social and governance \n ESG \n aspects into risk assessment in attempt to limit externalities \n Most of the ideas they list are related to economic changes and social aspects but strikingly few are explicitly related to any environmental policy change \n Governance and economic aspects \n Environmental aspects \n Social aspects \n Criticism \n Marxist view \n Sustainable capitalism as an oxymoron \n Government reluctance \n Governance and economic aspects \n Economic aspects are clearest perhaps because the economy is most easily associated with capitalism Sustainable capitalism as a policy outline is an attempt to address and tackle the use of \n admittedly insufficient tools \n used today to measure the economic growth and the real value of countries such as \n GDP \n or \n GO \n Criticism of this form of growth measurement is centered on the fact that GDP fails to account for labor conditions and other environmental factors which have a long-term influence on the value which it measures \n This concept follows recent trends that see forms of \n sustainable business \n as the preferred method for development because of the way that these types of businesses offer a positive influence to their environment Many of these stem from business-led corporate responsibility coalitions which aim to mitigate ESG impacts through mobilization of resources \n These business are not limited to the traditional non-profits we associate with corporate responsibility but also can be independent non-profit for-profit led by a board of directors or core-funded \n The wide spectrum of business types shows the gradual turn towards socially and environmentally responsible corporate governance \n Sustainable capitalism challenges the common model of the capitalist economy by its linear frame \n Raw materials \n either natural resources or intellect when combined with a capital increasing mechanism like worker power create marketable products that are sold for money and waste In the concept of sustainable capitalism it appears to be necessary to shift to a more circular economy where the end product would be reinvested not only to the capitalist business or financial institution but into the basis for raw materials and people who support this business \n This type of circular economy would require more responsibility on corporate governance to reduce externalities China has made advances in this area increasing renewable energy industries with an estimate that fossil fuels will no longer be the main source of energy by these steps toward change were forced in part by high pollution and population \n In their manifesto Gore and Blood propose key economic measures to change from the current form of capitalism \n Identify and incorporate risks from stranded assets \n Mandate integrated reporting \n End the default practice of issuing quarterly earnings guidance \n Align compensation structures with long-term sustainable performance \n Encourage long-term investing with loyalty-driven securities \n Reinforce sustainability as a fiduciary issue \n Create advisory services for sustainable asset management \n Expand the range and depth of sustainable investment products \n Reconsider the appropriate definition for growth beyond GDP \n Integrate sustainability into business education at all levels \n The first five items are most related to economic changes while the last five are actions more related to social aspects Of these ten only two are directly related to environmental aspects and none explicitly suggest environmental policy changes \n Environmental aspects \n As explained by Bruce Ledewitz sustainable capitalism is the adoption and development of sustainable practices that protect natural resources instead of spending it as capital Ledewitz claims that in traditional capitalism natural capital meaning natural resources will continue to decline and will limit monetary capital success lifting the value of natural resources and replacing the definition of prosperity He proposes that sustainable capitalism would institute policies and regulations to protect natural resources in addition to investing back into the environment in attempt to reverse the degradation \n Social aspects \n Social aspects of sustainable capitalism involve a positive reception toward climate change Author Mohan Munasinghe explains that two specific ways that humans can respond to climate change are through adaptation and mitigation First adaptation is aimed at reducing the vulnerability of human and natural systems in the face of climate change stresses while mitigation is aimed at lowering or removing GHG emissions to reduce radiative forcing of the atmosphere and the intensity of future climate change \n Economist John Ikerd claims that environmental degradation happens under modern capitalism because the economy is divorced from ethics \n According to him \n classical economists \n like \n Adam Smith \n had always intended for market economics to be tempered by property owners' moralities and \n neoclassical economists \n put undue faith in the ability of markets to automatically adjust to physical and moral imperatives Ikerd concludes that a system of \n environmental regulations \n founded on a popular ethical consensus is necessary and sufficient to prevent excessive \n climate change \n Sustainable capitalism is also viewed as a non-transcendent regulated commodity to humanity due to the ever-increasing demands of environmental regulation \n Geoffrey Strickland emphasizes that current discussions on economic development are led by the notion that human reproduction is a commodity that must be regulated and improved in order to encourage market efficiency which is a phenomenon that counteracts the growth of capitalism \n Criticism \n Marxist view \n According to the Marxist understanding of capitalism as production for profit it is impossible to prioritize environmental sustainability without abolishing capitalism \n Ernest Mandel \n claims that when \n profit maximization \n requires a business to pollute the air \"the simple right to clean air is abolished\" \n Under his conception of capitalism profit necessarily subjugates the environment and properly accounting for the social costs of production requires some form of \n socialist planning \n Any attempt to adequately protect the environment within such a capitalist framework is doomed to fail so the argument goes because society simply is not structured to be willing to sacrifice private profits for public endeavors on this scale \n Sustainable capitalism as an oxymoron \n The Capital Institute describes the concept of sustainable capitalism as an \n oxymoron \n They argue that modern capitalism is not designed for cooperation and much of the proposed measures in the manifesto are insufficient \n Regeneration cooperation and well-being are aspects of sustainability that do not coincide with what capitalism has evolved to be Efforts may be made to reform current capitalistic practices but mass movements focusing on environmental concerns that do not create a radical change of the system are not likely to succeed as they go against what capitalism was designed to achieve Capitalism and sustainability are mutually exclusive ideas given the current model \n Government reluctance \n Critics such as Neil E Harrison argue that the government would likely be resistant to sustainable changes for the current capitalist model Since the capitalist government was built upon capitalist ideals and business interests he argues the government is dependent on the system \n Often the government is most focused on overt crises rather than long-term solutions to problems that are not readily apparent His main argument is that beyond the current structure authority is not enough to control the social and economic aspects enough to truly impact the environmental needs \n Accumulation by dispossession \n Analytical Marxism \n Anti-capitalism \n Broad measures of economic

For the book see \n Cradle to Cradle Remaking the Way We Make Things \n Cradle-to-cradle design \n also referred to as \n Cradle to Cradle \n C2C \n cradle cradle \n or \n regenerative design \n is a \n biomimetic \n approach to the design of products and systems It models human industry on nature's processes viewing materials as nutrients circulating in healthy safe \n metabolisms \n It suggests that industry must protect and enrich \n ecosystems \n and nature's biological metabolism while also maintaining a safe productive technical metabolism for the high-quality use and circulation of \n organic \n and technical nutrients \n Put simply it is a \n holistic \n economic industrial and social framework that seeks to create systems that are not only efficient but also essentially waste free \n The model in its broadest sense is not limited to \n industrial design \n and \n manufacturing \n it can be applied to many aspects of human civilization such as \n urban environments \n buildings economics and \n social systems \n The term Cradle to Cradle is a registered trademark of McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry MBDC consultants Cradle to Cradle product certification began as a proprietary system however in MBDC turned the certification over to an independent non-profit called the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute Independence openness and transparency are the Institute's first objectives for the certification protocols \n The phrase \"cradle to cradle\" itself was coined by \n Walter R Stahel \n in the 1970s The current model is based on a system of \"lifecycle development\" initiated by \n Michael Braungart \n and colleagues at the \n Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency \n EPEA in the 1990s and explored through the publication \n A Technical Framework for \n Life-Cycle Assessment \n In Braungart and \n William McDonough \n published a book called \n Cradle to Cradle Remaking the Way We Make Things \n a \n manifesto \n for cradle to cradle design that gives specific details of how to achieve the model The model has been implemented by a number of companies organizations and governments around the world predominantly in the European Union China and the United States Cradle to cradle has also been the subject of many documentary films including the critically acclaimed \n Waste=Food \n The current economic system the

Finished products \n Implementation \n Major implementations \n Coordination with other models \n Constraints \n Criticism and response \n Introduction \n In the cradle to cradle model all materials used in industrial or commercial processessuch as metals \n fibers \n dyes \n fall into one of two categories \"technical\" or \"biological\" nutrients \n Technical nutrients \n are strictly limited to non-toxic non-harmful synthetic materials that have no negative effects on the natural environment they can be used in continuous cycles as the same product without losing their integrity or quality In this manner these materials can be used over and over again instead of being \" \n downcycled \n \" into lesser products ultimately becoming waste \n Biological Nutrients \n are \n organic materials \n that once used can be disposed of in any natural environment and decompose into the soil providing food for small life forms without affecting the natural environment This is dependent on the ecology of the region for example organic material from one country or landmass may be harmful to the ecology of another country or landmass \n Biological and Technical Cycles \n Biological and technical cycle \n The two types of materials each follow their own cycle in the regenerative economy envisioned by Keunen and Huizing \n Structure \n Initially defined by McDonough and Braungart the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute's five certification criteria are \n Material health which involves identifying the chemical composition of the materials that make up the product Particularly hazardous materials e g heavy metals pigments halogen compounds etc have to be reported whatever the concentration and other materials reported where they exceed ppm For wood the forest source is required The risk for each material is assessed against criteria and eventually ranked on a scale with green being materials of low risk yellow being those with moderate risk but are acceptable to continue to use and red for materials that have high risk and need to be phased out Grey for materials with incomplete data The method uses the term 'risk' in the sense of hazard as opposed to consequence and likelihood \n Material reutilization which is about recovery and recycling at the end of product life \n Assessment of energy required for production which for the highest level of certification needs to be based on at least 50% renewable energy for all parts and subassemblies \n Water particularly usage and discharge quality \n Social responsibility which assesses fair labor practices \n The certification is available at several levels basic silver gold platinum with more stringent requirements at each Prior to MBDC controlled the certification protocol \n Health \n Currently many human beings come into contact or consume directly or indirectly many harmful materials and chemicals daily In addition countless other forms of plant and animal life are also exposed C2C seeks to remove dangerous \n technical nutrients \n synthetic materials such as \n mutagenic \n materials \n heavy metals \n and other dangerous chemicals from current life cycles If the materials we come into contact with and are exposed to on a daily basis are not toxic and do not have long term health effects then the health of the overall system can be better maintained For example a fabric factory can eliminate all harmful \n technical nutrients \n by carefully reconsidering what chemicals they use in their dyes to achieve the colours they need and attempt to do so with fewer base chemicals \n Economics \n The use of a C2C model often lowers the financial cost of systems For example in the redesign of the \n Ford River Rouge Complex \n the planting of Sedum stonecrop vegetation on assembly plant roofs retains and cleanses rain water It also moderates the internal temperature of the building in order to save energy The roof is part of an $18 million rainwater treatment system designed to clean 20billion US gallons 000m \n of rainwater annually This saved Ford $50 million that would otherwise have been spent on mechanical treatment facilities \n If products are designed according to C2C design principles they can be manufactured and sold for less than alternative designs They eliminate the need for waste disposal such as landfills \n citation needed \n Definitions \n Cradle to Cradle \n a play on the phrase \"Cradle to Grave\" implying that the C2C model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations \n Technical nutrients \n are basically \n inorganic \n or synthetic materials manufactured by humanssuch as plastics and metalsthat can be used many times over without any loss in quality staying in a continuous cycle \n Biological nutrients \n and materials are \n organic materials \n that can decompose into the natural environment soil water etc without affecting it in a negative way providing food for bacteria and microbiological life \n Materials \n are usually referred to as the building blocks of other materials such as the dyes used in colouring fibers or rubbers used in the sole of a shoe \n Downcycling \n is the reuse of materials into lesser products For example a plastic computer case could be downcycled into a plastic cup which then becomes a park bench etc this may eventually lead to waste In conventional understanding this is no different from \n recycling \n that produces a supply of the same product or material \n Waste = Food \n is a basic concept of organic waste materials becoming food for bugs insects and other small forms of life who can feed on it decompose it and return it to the natural environment which we then indirectly use for food ourselves \n Existing synthetic materials \n The question of how to deal with the countless existing \n technical nutrients \n synthetic materials that cannot be recycled or reintroduced to the natural environment is dealt with in C2C design The materials that can be reused and retain their quality can be used within the technical nutrient cycles while other materials are far more difficult to deal with such as plastics in the Pacific Ocean \n Hypothetical examples \n One effective example is a shoe that is designed and mass-produced using the C2C model The sole might be made of \"biological nutrients\" while the upper parts might be made of \"technical nutrients \" The shoe is mass-produced at a manufacturing plant that utilises its waste material by putting it back into the cycle an example of this is using off-cuts from the rubber soles to make more soles instead of merely disposing of them this is dependent on the technical materials not losing their quality as they are reused Once the shoes have been manufactured they are distributed to retail outlets where the customer buys the shoe at a fraction of the price they would normally pay for a shoe of comparable aspects the customer is only paying for the use of the materials in the shoe for the period of time that they will be using the shoe When they outgrow the shoe or it is damaged they return it to the manufacturer When the manufacturer separates the sole from the upper parts separating the technical and biological nutrients the biological nutrients are returned to the natural environment while the technical nutrients are used to create the sole of another shoe \n Another example of C2C design is a disposable cup bottle or wrapper made entirely out of biological materials When the user is finished with the item it can be disposed of and returned to the natural environment the cost of disposal of waste such as landfill and recycling is eliminated The user could also potentially return the item for a refund so it can be used again \n Ford Model U \n is a design concept of a car made completely from cradle-to-cradle materials It also uses \n hydrogen propulsion \n Finished products \n Cradle-to-cradle shoes have been made through the \n Nike Considered \n project \n The \n Edag light car \n Rohner Textile AG \n Climatex \n -textile \n Biofoam \n a cradle-to-cradle alternative to \n expanded polystyrene \n Sewage sludge processing plants

\n BREEAM \n C2C principles were first applied to systems in the early 1990s by Braungart's \n Hamburger Umweltinstitut \n HUI and \n The Environmental Institute \n in Brazil for biomass nutrient recycling of effluent to produce agricultural products and clean water as a byproduct \n In William McDonough helped found the Center for Eco-Intelligent Management at Instituto de Empresa Business School The center's research produced the \n Biosphere Rules \n a set of five implementation principles that facilitate the adoption of closed loop production approaches with a minimum of disruption for established companies \n In MBDC and the EPEA formed a strategic partnership with global materials consultancy \n Material ConneXion \n to help promote and disseminate C2C design principles by providing greater global access to C2C material information certification and product development \n As of January Material ConneXion's Materials Libraries in New York \n Milan \n Cologne \n Bangkok \n and \n Daegu \n Korea \n started to feature C2C assessed and certified materials and in collaboration with MBDC and EPEA the company now offers C2C Certification and C2C product development \n

cradle compliant \n Several private houses and communal buildings in the Netherlands \n Fashion Positive an initiative to assist the fashion world in implementing the cradle-to-cradle model in five areas material health material reuse renewable energy water stewardship and social fairness \n Coordination with other models \n The Cradle to Cradle model can be viewed as a framework that considers systems as a whole or \n holistically \n It can be applied to many aspects of human society and is related to \n Life cycle assessment \n See for instance the LCA based model of the \n Eco-costs \n which has been designed to cope with analyses of recycle systems \n The Cradle to Cradle model in some implementations is closely linked with the \n Car-free movement \n such as in the case of large-scale building projects or the construction or redevelopment of urban environments It is closely linked with \n passive solar design \n in the building industry and with \n permaculture \n in agriculture within or near urban environments An \n earthship \n is a perfect example where different re-use models are used cradle to cradle and permaculture \n In IE Business School in Madrid launched the Center for Eco-Intelligent Innovation in collaboration with William McDonough to study the implementation of Cradle to Cradle design approaches in pioneering businesses The academic research of companies lead to the elaboration of the \n Biosphere Rules \n a set of five principles derived from nature that guide the implementation of circular models in production \n Constraints \n A major constraint in the optimal recycling of materials is that at civic amenity sites products are not disassembled by hand and have each individual part sorted into a bin but instead have the entire product sorted into a certain bin \n This makes the extraction of rare earth elements and other materials uneconomical at recycling sites products typically get crushed after which the materials are extracted by means of magnets chemicals special sorting methods and thus optimal recycling of for example metals is impossible an optimal recycling method for metals would require to sort all similar alloys together rather than mixing plain iron with alloys \n Obviously disassembling products is not feasible at currently designed civic amenity sites and a better method would be to send back the broken products to the manufacturer so that the manufacturer can disassemble the product These disassembled product can then be used for making new products or at least to have the components sent separately to recycling sites for proper recycling by the exact type of material At present though few laws are put in place in any country to oblige manufacturers to \n take back their products for disassembly \n nor are there even such obligations for manufacturers of cradle-to-cradle products One process where this is happening is in the EU with the \n Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive \n Criticism and response \n Criticism has been advanced \n on the fact that McDonough and Braungart previously kept C2C consultancy and certification in their inner circle Critics argued that this lack of competition prevented the model from fulfilling its potential Many critics pleaded for a public-private partnership overseeing the C2C concept thus enabling competition and growth of practical applications and services \n McDonough and Braungart responded to this criticism by giving control of the certification protocol to a non-profit independent Institute called the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute McDonough said the new institute \"will enable our protocol to become a public certification program and global standard \" \n The new Institute announced the creation of a Certification Standards Board in June The new board under the auspices of the Institute will oversee the certification moving forward \n Experts in the field of environment protection have questioned the practicability of the concept \n Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek \n head of the German \n Wuppertal Institute \n called his assertion that the \"old\" environmental movement had hindered innovation with its pessimist approach \"pseudo-psychological humbug\" \n I can feel very nice on Michael's seat covers \n in the airplane Nevertheless I am still waiting for a detailed proposal for a design of the other percent of the \n Airbus \n after his principles \n In Schmidt-Bleek stated that it is out of the question that the concept can be realized on a bigger scale \n Some claim that C2C certification may not be entirely sufficient in all \n eco-design \n approaches Quantitative methodologies LCAs and more adapted tools regarding the product type which is considered could be used in tandem The C2C concept ignores the use phase of a product According to \n the Variants of Life Cycle Assessment \n the entire life cycle of a product or service has to be evaluated not only the material itself For many goods e g in transport the use phase has the most influence on the environmental footprint E g the more lightweight a car or a plane the less fuel it consumes and consequently the less impact it has Braungart fully ignores the use phase \n It is safe to say that every production step or resource-transformation step needs a certain amount of energy \n The C2C concept foresees an own certification of its analysis \n and therefore is in contradiction to international ISO standards \n and \n for \n Life Cycle Assessment \n whereas an independent and critical review is needed in order to obtain comparative and resilient results Independent external review \n Permaculture \n Planned obsolescence \n the opposite of durable no waste

\"ecocity\" is a city designed with consideration of \n environmental impact \n inhabited by people dedicated towards minimization of required inputs of energy water and food and waste output of heat \n air pollution \n - \n CO \n methane \n and water pollution Richard Register first coined the term \"ecocity\" in his book \n Ecocity Berkeley Building Cities for a Healthy Future \n Other leading figures who envisioned the sustainable city are \n architect \n Paul F Downton \n who later founded the company Ecopolis Pty Ltd and authors \n Timothy Beatley \n and \n Steffen Lehmann \n who have written extensively on the subject The field of \n industrial ecology \n is sometimes used in planning these cities \n There remains no completely agreed upon definition for what a sustainable city should be or completely agreed upon paradigm for what components should be included \n Generally developmental experts agree that a sustainable city should meet the needs of the present without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs The ambiguity within this idea leads to a great deal of variation in terms of how cities carry out their attempts to become sustainable \n Ideally a sustainable city creates an enduring way of life across the four domains of ecology economics politics and culture \n However minimally a sustainable city should firstly be able to feed itself with a sustainable reliance on the surrounding countryside Secondly it should be able to power itself with renewable sources of energy The crux of this is to create the smallest possible \n ecological footprint \n and to produce the lowest quantity of \n pollution \n possible to efficiently use land compost used materials recycle it or convert \n waste-to-energy \n and thus the city's overall contribution to \n climate change \n will be minimal if such practices are adhered to \n It is estimated that over 50% \n of the worlds population now lives in cities and urban areas These large communities provide both challenges and opportunities for \n environmentally-conscious \n developers and there are distinct advantages to further defining and working towards the goals of sustainable cities Humans are social creatures and thrive in urban spaces that foster social connections Because of this a shift to more dense urban living would provide an outlet for social interaction and conditions under which humans can prosper \n Contrary to common belief urban systems can be more environmentally sustainable than rural or suburban living With people and resource located so close to one another it is possible to save energy for transportation and mass transit systems and resources such as food Finally cities benefit the economy by locating human capital in one relatively small geographic area where ideas can be generated \n Practical achievement \n Architecture \n Eco-industrial park \n Urban farming \n Urban infill \n Walkable urbanism \n New Urbanism \n

States \n Further reading \n Practical achievement \n These ecological cities are achieved through various means such as \n Different \n agricultural systems \n such as agricultural plots within the city \n suburbs \n or \n centre \n This reduces the distance food has to travel from \n field to fork \n Practical work out of this may be done by either small scale/private farming plots or through larger scale agriculture e g \n farmscrapers \n Renewable energy \n sources such as \n wind turbines \n solar panels \n or \n bio-gas \n created from \n sewage \n Cities provide \n economies of scale \n that make such energy sources viable \n Various methods to reduce the need for \n air conditioning \n a massive energy demand such as planting trees and lightening surface colors \n natural ventilation systems \n an increase in water features and green spaces equaling at least 20% of the city's surface These measures counter the \" \n heat island effect \n \" caused by an abundance of tarmac and asphalt which can make urban areas several degrees warmer than surrounding rural areasas much as six degrees Celsius during the evening \n Improved \n public transport \n and an increase in pedestrianization to reduce car emissions This requires a radically different approach to city planning with integrated business industrial and residential zones Roads may be designed to make driving difficult \n Optimal building density to make public transport viable but avoid the creation of \n urban heat islands \n Solutions to decrease \n urban sprawl \n by seeking new ways of allowing people to live closer to the workspace \n citation needed \n Since the workplace tends to be in the city downtown or urban center they are seeking a way to increase density by changing the antiquated attitudes many suburbanites have towards inner-city areas \n citation needed \n One of the new ways to achieve this is by solutions worked out by the \n Smart Growth \n Movement \n citation needed \n Green roofs \n Sustainable transport \n Zero-energy building \n Sustainable urban drainage systems \n or SUDS \n energy conservation systems/devices \n Xeriscaping \n - garden and landscape design for water conservation \n Key Performance Indicators \n - development and operational management tool providing guidance and M&V for city administrators \n Architecture \n Buildings provide the infrastructure for a functioning city and allow for many opportunities to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability A commitment to sustainable architecture encompasses all phases of building including the planning building and restructuring \n Eco-industrial park \n The purpose of an eco-industrial park is to connect a number of firms and organizations to work together to decrease their environmental impact while simultaneously improving their economic performance \n The community of businesses accomplishes this goal through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues such as energy water and materials \n The components for building an eco-industrial park include natural systems more efficient use of energy and more efficient material and water flows \n Industrial parks should be built to fit into their natural settings in order to reduce environmental impacts which can be accomplished through plant design landscaping and choice of materials For instance there is an industrial park in Michigan built by Phoenix Designs that is made almost entirely from recycled materials \n The landscaping of the building will include native trees grasses and flowers and the landscaping design will also act as climate shelter for the facility \n In choosing the materials for building an eco-industrial park designers must consider the life-cycle analysis of each medium that goes into the building to assess their true impact on the environment and to ensure that they are using it from one plant to another steam connections from firms to provide heating for homes in the area and using renewable energy such as wind and solar power \n In terms of material flows the companies in an eco-industrial park may have common waste treatment facilities a means for transporting by-products from one plant to another or anchoring the park around \n resource recovery \n companies that are recruited to the location or started from scratch \n To create more efficient water flows in industrial parks the processed water from one plant can be reused by another plant and the parks infrastructure can include a way to collect and reuse storm water runoff \n Urban farming \n Urban farming \n is the process of growing and distributing food as well as raising animals in and around a city or in urban area According to the \n RUAF Foundation \n urban farming is different from \n rural agriculture \n because \"it is integrated into the urban economic and ecological system urban agriculture is embedded in -and interacting with- the urban ecosystem Such linkages include the use of urban residents as labourers use of typical urban resources like organic waste as compost and urban wastewater for irrigation direct links with urban consumers direct impacts on urban ecology positive and negative being part of the urban food system competing for land with other urban functions being influenced by urban policies and plans etc \" \n There are many motivations behind urban agriculture but in the context of creating a sustainable city this method of food cultivation saves energy in food transportation and saves costs In order for urban farming to be a successful method of sustainable food growth cities must allot a common area for community gardens or farms as well as a common area for a farmers market in which the foodstuffs grown within the city can be sold to the residents of the urban system \n Read more on the \n Urban Agriculture \n page \n Berms of fava beans have been planted at Hayes Valley Farm a community-built farm on the former Central freeway ramps of San Francisco \n Urban infill \n Many cities are currently in a shift from the suburban sprawl model of development to a return to urban dense living This shift in geographic distribution of population leads to a denser core of city residents These residents provide a growing demand in many sectors that is reflected in the architectural fabric of the city This new demand can be supplied by new construction or historic rehabilitation Sustainable cities will opt for historical rehabilitation wherever possible Having people live in higher densities not only gives economies of scale but also allows for infrastructure to be more efficient \n Walkable urbanism \n Walkable urbanism \n is a development strategy in opposition to suburban sprawl It advocates housing for a diverse population a full mix of uses walkable streets positive \n public space \n integrated civic and commercial centers transit orientation and accessible open space It also advocates for density and accessibility of commercial and government activity \n New Urbanism \n The most clearly defined form of walkable urbanism is known as the Charter of \n New Urbanism \n It is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve smart cities which support \n sustainable transport \n Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures compared with those living in \n sprawling \n suburbs \n The concept of \n Circular flow land use management \n has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land taken by urban sprawl \n In \n sustainable architecture \n the recent movement of \n New Classical Architecture \n promotes a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops \n smart growth \n walkability \n architectural tradition \n and \n classical design \n This in contrast to \n modernist \n and \n globally uniform \n architecture as well as opposing solitary \n housing estates \n and \n suburban sprawl \n Both trends started in the 1980s \n Individual buildings LEED \n Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design \n LEED or \n Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design \n is an internationally recognized \n green building \n certification system LEED recognizes whole building sustainable design by identifying key areas of excellence including Sustainable Sites Water Efficiency Energy and Atmosphere Materials and Resources Indoor Environmental Quality Locations & Linkages Awareness and Education Innovation in Design Regional Priority \n In order for a building to become LEED certified sustainability needs to be prioritized in design construction and use One example of sustainable design would be including a \n certified wood \n like bamboo Bamboo is fast growing and has an incredible replacement rate after being harvested By far the most credits are rewarded for optimizing energy performance This promotes innovative thinking about alternative forms of energy and encourages increased efficiency \n Transportation \n As major focus of the sustainable cities \n sustainable transportation \n attempts to reduce a citys reliance and use of greenhouse emitting gases by utilizing eco friendly \n urban planning \n low environmental impact vehicles and residential proximity to create an urban center that has greater environmental responsibility and \n social equity \n Due to the significant impact that transportation services have on a citys energy consumption the last decade has seen an increasing emphasis on sustainable transportation by developmental experts Currently transportation systems account for nearly a quarter of the worlds energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission In order to reduce the environmental impact caused by transportation in metropolitan areas sustainable transportation has three widely agreed upon pillars that it utilizes to create more healthy and productive urban centers \n The \n Carbon Trust \n states that there are three main ways cities can innovate to make transport more sustainable without increasing journey times - better land use planning modal shift to encourage people to choose more efficient forms of transport and making existing transport modes more efficient \n Car free city \n The concept of \n Car free cities \n or a city with large \n pedestrian areas \n is often part of the design of a sustainable city A large part of the \n carbon footprint \n of a city is generated by cars so the car free concept is often considered an integral part of the design of a sustainable city \n Emphasis on proximity \n Created by eco friendly urban planning the concept of \n urban proximity \n is an essential element of current and future sustainable transportation systems This requires that cities be built and added onto with appropriate population and landmark density so that destinations are reached with reduced time in transit This reduced time in transit allows for reduced fuel expenditure and also opens the door to alternative means of transportation such as bike riding and walking \n Transportation in downtown \n Chicago \n Furthermore close proximity of residents and major landmarks allows for the creation of efficient public transportation by eliminating long sprawled out routes and reducing commute time This in turn decreases the social cost to residents who choose to live in these cities by allowing them more time with families and friends instead by eliminating a part of their commute time \n Compact City \n and \n Pocket neighborhood \n Diversity in modes of transportation \n Sustainable transportation emphasizes the use of a diversity of \n fuel-efficient \n transportation vehicles in order to reduce greenhouse emissions and diversity fuel demand Due to the increasingly expensive and volatile cost of energy this strategy has become very important because it allows a way for city residents to be less susceptible to varying highs and lows in various energy prices \n Among the different modes of transportation the use alternative energy cars and widespread instillation of refueling stations has gained increasing importance while the creation of centralized bike and walking paths remains a staple of the sustainable transportation movement \n Access to transportation \n In order to maintain the aspect of \n social responsibility \n inherent within the concept of sustainable cities implementing \n sustainable transportation \n must include access to transportation by all levels of society Due to the fact that car and fuel cost are often too expensive for lower income urban residents completing this aspect often revolves around efficient and accessible public transportation \n In order to make public transportation more accessible the cost of rides must be affordable and stations must be located no more than walking distance in each part of the city As studies have shown this accessibility creates a great increase in social and productive opportunity for city residents By allowing lower income residents cheap and available transportation it allows for individuals to seek employment opportunities all over the urban center rather than simply the area in which they live This in turn reduces unemployment and a number of associated social problems such as crime drug use and violence \n Urban strategic planning \n Although there is not an international policy regarding sustainable cities and there are not established international standards there is an organization the \n United Cities and Local Governments \n UCLG that is working to establish universal urban strategic guidelines The UCLG a democratic and decentralized structure that operates in Africa Asia Eurasia Europe Latin America North America Middle East West Asian and a Metropolitan section work to promote a more sustainable society \n The members of the UCLG committee evaluate urban development strategies and debate theses experiences to make the best recommendations Additionally the UCLG accounts for differences in regional and national context All the organizations are making a great effort to promote this concept by media and internet and in conferences and workshops An International conference is going to be held in Italy at Universit del Salento and Universit degli Studi della Basilicata called Green Urbanism from October \n Development \n Recently local and national governments and regional bodies such as the European Union have recognized the need for a holistic understanding of \n urban planning \n This is instrumental to establishing an international policy that focuses on cities challenges and the role of the local authorities responses Generally in terms of urban planning the responsibility of local governments are limited to \n land use \n and infrastructure provision excluding inclusive urban development strategies The advantages of urban strategic planning include an increase in governance and cooperation that aides local governments in establishing performance based-management clearly identifying the challenges facing local community and more effectively responding on a local level rather than national level and finally it improves institutional responses and local decision making \n Additionally it increases dialogue between stakeholders and develops consensus-based solutions establishing continuity between sustainability plans and change in local government it places environmental issues as the priority for the sustainable development of cities and serves as a platform to develop concepts and new models of housing energy and mobility \n Obstacles \n The \n City Development Strategies \n CDS addresses new challenges and provides space for innovative policies that involves all stakeholders The inequality in spatial development and socio-economic classes paired with concerns of \n poverty reduction \n and \n climate change \n are factors in achieving global sustainable cities According to the \n UCLG \n there are differences between regional and national conditions framework and practice that are overcome in the international commitment to communication and negotiation with other governments communities and the private sector to continual to develop through innovative and participatory approaches in strategic decisions building consensus and monitoring performance management and raising investment \n Social factors of sustainable cities \n According to \n UN Habitat \n around half of the world's population is concentrated in cities which is set to rise to 60% within a couple decades \n The UCLG has specifically identified global challenges to establishing sustainable cities demographic change and migration globalisation of the job market poverty and unmet Millennium Development Goals segregation spatial patterns and urban growth metropolisation and the rise of urban regions more political power for local authories new actors for developing a city and providing services decline in public funding for development the environment and climate change new and accessible building technologies preparing

days Sites include parks reserves transport corridors schools water courses and coastline Only trees native to the local area are planted to ensure genetic integrity Premier Rann said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaide's greenhouse gas emissions by tonnes of C02 a year He said it was also about creating and conserving habitat for wildlife and preventing species loss \n Solar power \n The Rann government also launched an initiative for Adelaide to lead Australia in the take-up of solar power In addition to Australia's first 'feed-in' tariff to stimulate the purchase of solar panels for domestic roofs the government committed millions of dollars to place arrays of solar panels on the roofs of public buildings such as the Museum Art Gallery Parliament Adelaide Airport schools and Australia's biggest rooftop array on the roof of Adelaide Showgrounds' convention hall which was registered as a power station \n Wind power \n South Australia went from zero wind power in to wind power making up 26% of its electricity generation by October In years to there was a 15% drop in emissions despite

systemic change resistance \n The environmental \n sustainability \n problem has proven difficult to solve The modern \n environmental movement \n has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways But little progress has been made as shown by severe \n ecological footprint \n overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the \n climate change \n problem Something within the human system is preventing change to a sustainable mode of behavior That system trait is \n systemic change resistance \n Change resistance is also known as organizational resistance barriers to change or policy resistance \n Overview of resistance to solving the sustainability problem \n The change resistance and proper coupling subproblems \n Systemic versus individual change resistance \n The current focus is on proper coupling \n Overcoming systemic change resistance \n Overview of resistance to solving the sustainability problem \n While environmentalism had long been a minor force in political change the movement strengthened significantly in the 1970s with the first \n Earth Day \n in in which over million people participated with publication of \n The Limits to Growth \n in and with the first \n United Nations Conference on the Human Environment \n in Stockholm in Early expectations the problem could be solved ran high out of members of the United Nations attended the Stockholm conference The conference was widely seen at the time as a harbinger of success \n \"Many believe the most important result of the conference was the precedent it set for international cooperation in addressing environmental degradation The nations attending agreed they shared responsibility for the quality of the environment particularly the oceans and the atmosphere and they signed a declaration of principles after extensive negotiations concerning their obligations The conference also approved an environmental fund and an action program which involved specific recommendations for addressing such problems as global climate change marine pollution population growth the dumping of toxic wastes and the preservation of biodiversity A permanent environment unit was established for coordinating these and other international efforts This later became the United Nations Environmental Program which was was formally approved by the General Assembly later that same year and its base established in Nairobi Kenya This organization not only coordinated action but monitored research collecting and disseminating information and it has played an ongoing role in international negotiations about environmental issues \n \"The conference in Stockholm accomplished almost everything the preparatory committed had planned It was widely considered successful and many observers were almost euphoric about the extent of agreement \" \n However despite the work of a worldwide \n environmental movement \n many national environmental protection agencies creation of the \n United Nations Environment Programme \n and many international environmental treaties the sustainability problem continues to grow worse The latest \n ecological footprint \n data shows the worlds footprint increased from about 50% \n undershoot \n in to 50% \n overshoot \n in the last year data is available \n In the first edition of \n The Limits to Growth \n analyzed the environmental sustainability problem using a \n system dynamics \n model The widely influential book predicted that \n \"If the present trends in world population industrialization pollution food production and resource depletion continue unchanged the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years The most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity some time in the 21st century \" \n Yet thirty-two years later in the third edition reported that \n \" The second edition of Limits to Growth was published in the year of the global summit on environment and development in Rio de Janeiro The advent of the summit seemed to prove that global society had decided to deal seriously with the important environmental problems But we now know that humanity failed to achieve the goals of Rio The Rio plus conference in Johannesburg in produced even less it was almost paralyzed by a variety of ideological and economic disputes due to the efforts of those pursuing their narrow national corporate or individual self-interests \n \" humanity has largely squandered the past years \" \n Change resistance runs so high that the worlds top two greenhouse gas emitters \n China \n and the \n United States \n have never adopted the \n Kyoto Protocol \n treaty In the US resistance was so strong that in the US Senate voted to zero against the treaty by passing the \n ByrdHagel Resolution \n despite the fact \n Al Gore \n was vice-president at the time Not a single senator could be persuaded to support the treaty which has not been brought back to the floor since \n Due to prolonged change resistance the climate change problem has escalated to the climate change crisis \n Greenhouse gas \n emissions are rising much faster than \n IPCC \n models expected The growth rate of fossil fuel emissions was 5% per year for 2000-2007 an almost four fold increase from 9% per year in 1990-1999 This makes current trends in emissions higher than the worst case IPCC-SRES scenario \n The \n Copenhagen Climate Summit \n of December ended in failure \n No agreement on binding targets was reached The \n Cancun Climate Summit \n in December did not break the deadlock The best it could do was another non-binding agreement \n Recognizing that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet and thus requires to be urgently addressed by all Parties \n This indicates no progress at all since when the \n United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \n was created at the \n Earth Summit \n in \n Rio de Janeiro \n The Cancun agreement was the functional equivalent of what the agreement said \n \"The Parties to this Convention acknowledge that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response thus the parties recognize that States should enact effective environmental legislation to protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind \" \n Negotiations have bogged down so pervasively that Climate policy is gridlocked and theres virtually no chance of a breakthrough \n Climate policy as it has been understood and practised by many governments of the world under the Kyoto Protocol approach has failed to produce any discernible real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years \n These events suggest that change resistance to solving the sustainability problem is so high the problem is currently unsolvable \n The change resistance and proper coupling subproblems \n Understanding change resistance requires seeing it as a distinct and separate part of the sustainability problem Tanya Markvarts thesis on \n Understanding Institutional Change and Resistance to Change Towards Sustainability \n stated that \n \"It has also been demonstrated that ecologically destructive and inequitable institutional systems can be highly resilient and resistant to change even in the face of social-ecological degradation and/or collapse e g Berkes & Folke Allison & Hobbs Brown Runnalls Finley Walker et al \" \n The thesis focuses specifically on developing an interdisciplinary theoretical framework for understanding institutional change and resistance to change towards sustainability \n Jack Harich's paper on \n Change Resistance as the Crux of the Environmental Sustainability Problem \n argues there are two separate problems to solve \n A \n root cause analysis \n and a \n system dynamics \n model were used to explain how \n \" difficult social problems like sustainability must be decomposed into two sequential subproblems \n How to overcome change resistance \n and then \n How to achieve proper coupling \n This is the timeless strategy of divide and conquer By cleaving one big problem into two the problem becomes an order of magnitude easier to solve because we can approach the two subproblems differently and much more appropriately We are no longer unknowingly attempting to solve two very different problems simultaneously \" \n The paper discussed the two subproblems \n \" \n Change resistance \n is the tendency for a system to continue its current behavior despite the application of force to change that behavior \n \" \n Proper coupling \n occurs when the behavior of one system affects the behavior of other systems in a desirable manner using the appropriate \n feedback loops \n so the systems work together in harmony in accordance with design objectives In the environmental sustainability problem the human system has become improperly coupled to the greater system it lives within the environment \n \"Change resistance versus proper coupling allows a crucial distinction Society is aware of the proper practices required to live sustainably and the need to do so But society has a strong aversion to adopting these practices As a result problem solvers have created thousands of effective and often ingenious proper practices But they are stymied in their attempts to have them taken up by enough of the system to solve the problem because an 'implicit system goal' is causing insurmountable change resistance \n Therefore systemic change resistance is the crux of the problem and must be solved first \n \" \n The proper coupling subproblem is what most people consider as the problem to solve It is called \n decoupling \n in economic and environmental fields where the term refers to economic growth without additional environmental degradation Solving the proper coupling problem is the goal of environmentalism and in particular \n ecological economics \n Ecological economics is the study of the interactions and co-evolution in time and space of human economies and the ecosystems in which human economies are embedded \n Change resistance is also called barriers to change Hoffman and Bazerman in a chapter on Understanding and overcoming the organizational and psychological barriers to action concluded that \n \"In this chapter we argue that the change in thinking required of the sustainability agenda will never come to fruition within practical domains unless proper attention is given to the sources of individual and social resistance to such change The implementation of wise management practices cannot be accomplished without a concurrent set of strategies for surmounting these barriers \" \n John Sterman \n current leader of the system dynamics school of thought came to the same conclusion \n \"The civil rights movement provides a better analogy for the climate challenge Then as now entrenched special interests vigorously opposed change Of course we need more research and technical innovationmoney and genius are always in short supply But there is no purely technical solution for climate change For public policy to be grounded in the hard-won results of climate science we must now turn our attention to the dynamics of social and political change \" \n These findings indicate there are at least two subproblems to be solved change resistance and proper coupling Given the human systems long history of unsuccessful attempts to self-correct to a sustainable mode it appears that high change resistance is preventing proper coupling This may be expressed as an emerging principle systemic change resistance is the crux of the sustainability problem and must be solved first before the human system can be properly coupled to the greater system it lives within the environment \n Systemic versus individual change resistance \n Systemic change resistance differs significantly from individual change resistance Systemic means originating from the system in such a manner as to affect the behavior of most or all social agents of certain types as opposed to originating from individual agents \n Individual change resistance originates from individual people and organizations How the two differ may be seen in this passage \n \"The notion of resistance to change is credited to Kurt Lewin His conceptualization of the phrase however is very different from todays usage which treats resistance to change as a psychological concept where resistance or support of change comes from values habits mental models and so on residing within the individual For Lewin resistance to change could occur but that resistance could be anywhere in the system As Kotter found \n it is possible for the resistance to be sited within the individual but it is much more likely to be found elsewhere in the system \n \"Systems of social roles with their associated patterns of attitudes expectations and behavior norms share with biological systems the characteristic of homeostasisi e tendencies to resist change to restore the previous state after a disturbance \n \"Lewin had been working on this idea that the status quo represented an equilibrium between the barriers to change and the forces favoring change since as part of his field theory He believed that some difference in these forcesweakening of the barriers or strengthening of the driving forceswas required to produce the unfreezing that began a change \" \n If sources of systemic change resistance are present they are the principal cause of individual change resistance According to the \n fundamental attribution error \n it is crucial to address systemic change resistance when present and avoid assuming that change resistance can be overcome by bargaining reasoning inspirational appeals and so on This is because \n \"A fundamental principle of system dynamics states that the structure of the system gives rise to its behavior However people have a strong tendency to attribute the behavior of others to dispositional rather than situational factors that is to character and especially character flaws rather than the system in which these people are acting The tendency to blame the person rather than the system is so strong psychologists call it the 'fundamental attribution error ' \" \n Peter Senge \n a thought leader of \n systems thinking \n for the business world describes the structural source of systemic change resistance as being due to an implicit system goal \n \"In general balancing loops are more difficult to see than reinforcing loops because it often looks like nothing is happening Theres no dramatic growth of sales and marketing expenditures or nuclear arms or lily pads Instead the balancing process maintains the status quo even when all participants want change The feeling as Lewis Carrolls Queen of Hearts put it of needing all the running you can do to keep in the same place is a clue that a balancing loop may exist nearby \n \"Leaders who attempt organizational change often find themselves unwittingly caught in balancing processes To the leaders it looks as though their efforts are clashing with sudden resistance that seems to come from nowhere In fact as my friend found when he tried to reduce burnout the resistance is a response by the system trying to maintain an \n implicit system goal \n Until this goal is recognized the change effort is \n doomed to failure \n \" \n Senges insight applies to the sustainability problem Until the implicit system goal causing systemic change resistance is found and resolved change efforts to solve the proper coupling part of the sustainability problem may be as Senge argues doomed to failure \n The current focus is on proper coupling \n Presently environmentalism is focused on solving the proper coupling subproblem For example the following are all proper coupling solutions They attempt to solve the direct cause of the sustainability problems symptoms \n The \n Kyoto Protocol \n The \n Three Rs \n of reduce reuse recycle \n More use of \n renewable energy \n Better \n pollution control \n of many kinds \n Collective management of \n common-pool resources \n Certification programs to reduce deforestation such as \n PEFC \n and \n FSC \n Contour farming \n to reduce soil erosion \n The \n green revolution \n Zero population growth \n The direct cause of environmental impact is the three factors on the right side of the \n I=PAT equation \n where \n I \n mpact equals \n P \n opulation times \n A \n ffluence consumption per person times \n T \n echnology environmental impact per unit of consumption It is these three factors that solutions like those listed above seek to reduce \n The top environmental organization in the world the \n United Nations Environmental Programme \n UNEP focuses exclusively on proper coupling solutions \n \"2010 marked the beginning of a period of new strategic and transformational direction for UNEP as it began implementing its Medium Term Strategy MTS for 2010-2013 across six areas Climate change Disasters and conflicts Ecosystem management Environmental governance Harmful substances and hazardous waste Resource efficiency Sustainable consumption and production \" \n The six areas are all direct practices to reduce the three factors of the I=PAT equation \n Al Gores \n ' documentary film \n An Inconvenient Truth \n described the climate change problem and the urgency of solving it The film concluded with Gore saying \n \"Each one of us is a cause of global warming but each one of us can make choices to change that with the things we buy the electricity we use the cars we drive we can make choices to bring our individual carbon emissions to zero The solutions are in our hands \n we just have to have the determination to make it happen We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions everything but political will \n But in America the will to act is a renewable resource \" \n The four solutions Gore mentions are proper coupling practices There is however a hint of acknowledgement that overcoming systemic change resistance is the real challenge when Gore says we just have to have the determination to make it happen We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions everything but political will \n The twenty-seven solutions that appear during the films closing credits are mostly proper coupling solutions The first nine are \n Go to \n www climatecrisis net \n You can reduce your carbon emissions In fact you can even reduce your carbon emissions to zero \n Buy energy efficient appliances & light bulbs \n Change your thermostat and use clock thermostats to reduce energy for heating & cooling \n Weatherize your house increase insulation get an energy audit \n Recycle \n If you can buy a hybrid car \n When you can walk or ride a bicycle \n Where you can use light rail & mass transit \n Some solutions are attempts to overcome individual change resistance such as \n Tell your parents not to ruin the world that you will live in \n If you are a parent join with your children to save the world they will live in \n Vote for leaders who pledge to solve this crisis \n Write to congress If they dont listen run for congress \n Speak up in your community \n However none of the twenty-seven solutions deal with overcoming systemic change resistance \n Overcoming systemic change resistance \n Efforts here are sparse because environmentalism is currently not oriented toward treating systemic change resistance as a distinct and separate problem to solve \n On how to specifically overcome the change resistance subproblem Markvart examined two leading theories that seemed to offer insight into change resistance \n Panarchy \n theory and \n New Institutionalism \n and concluded that \n \" neither theory devotes significant attention to understanding the dynamics of resilient and resistant but inefficient and/or unproductive institutional and ecological systems Overall more research is required \" \n Taking a \n root cause analysis \n and \n system dynamics \n modeling approach Harich carefully defined the three characteristics of a \n root cause \n and then found a main systemic root cause for both the change resistance and proper coupling subproblems \n Several sample solution elements for resolving the root causes were suggested The point was made that the exact solution policies chosen do not matter nearly as much as finding the correct systemic root causes Once these are found how to resolve them is relatively obvious because once a root cause is found by structural modeling the high leverage point for resolving it follows easily Solutions may then push on specific structural points in the social system which due to careful modeling will have fairly predictable effects \n This reaffirms the work of \n Donella Meadows \n as expressed in her classic essay on \n Leverage Points Places to Intervene in a System \n The final page stated that \n \"The higher the leverage point the more the system will resist changing it \" \n Here Meadows refers to the leverage point for resolving the proper coupling subproblem rather than the leverage point for overcoming change resistance This is because the current focus of environmentalism is on proper coupling \n However if the leverage points associated with the root causes of change resistance exist and can be found the system will not resist changing them This is an important principle of social system behavior \n For example Harich found the main root cause of successful systemic change resistance to be high \"deception effectiveness \" The source was special interests particularly large for-profit corporations The high leverage point was raising \"general ability to detect manipulative deception \" This can be done with a variety of solution elements such as \"The Truth Test \" This effectively increases truth literacy just as conventional education raises reading and writing \n literacy \n Few citizens resist literacy education because its benefits have become so obvious \n Promotion of \n corporate social responsibility \n CSR has been used to try to overcome change resistance to solving social problems including environmental sustainability This solution strategy has not worked well because it is voluntary and does not resolve root causes \n Milton Friedman \n explained why CSR fails \"The social responsibility of business is to increase profits \" \n Business cannot be responsible to society It can only be responsible to its shareholders"},

carbon footprint \n is historically defined as the total set of \n greenhouse gas \n emissions caused by an individual event organisation or product expressed as \n carbon dioxide equivalent \n In most cases the total carbon footprint cannot be exactly calculated because of inadequate knowledge of and data about the complex interactions between contributing processes especially which including the influence on natural processes storing or releasing carbon dioxide For this reason Wright Kemp and Williams have suggested to define the carbon footprint as \n A measure of the total amount of \n carbon dioxide \n CO \n and \n methane \n CH \n emissions of a defined population system or activity considering all relevant sources sinks and storage within the spatial and temporal boundary of the population system or activity of interest Calculated as carbon dioxide equivalent using the relevant 100-year \n global warming potential \n GWP100 \n Greenhouse gases GHGs can be emitted through land clearance and the production and consumption of food fuels manufactured goods materials wood roads buildings transportation and other services \n For simplicity of reporting it is often expressed in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide or its equivalent of other GHGs emitted \n Most of the carbon footprint emissions for the average U S household come from \"indirect\" sources i e fuel burned to produce goods far away from the final consumer These are distinguished from emissions which come from burning fuel directly in one's car or stove commonly referred to as \"direct\" sources of the consumer's carbon footprint \n The concept name of the carbon footprint originates from \n ecological footprint \n discussion \n which was developed by Rees and Wackernagel in the 1990s which estimates the number of \"earths\" that would theoretically be required if everyone on the planet consumed resources at the same level as the person calculating their ecological footprint However given that ecological footprints are a measure of failure Anindita Mitra CREA Seattle chose the more easily calculated \"carbon footprint\" to easily measure use of carbon as an indicator of unsustainable energy use In carbon footprint was used as a measure of carbon emissions to develop the energy plan for City of Lynnwood Washington Carbon footprints are much more specific than ecological footprints since they measure direct emissions of gases that cause climate change into the atmosphere \n Carbon footprint is one of a family of footprint indicators which also includes \n

diet transportation choices home size shopping and recreational activities usage of electricity heating and heavy appliances such as dryers and refrigerators and so on The website then estimates your carbon footprint based on your answers to these questions A systematic literature review was conducted to objectively determine the best way to calculate individual/household carbon footprints This review identified calculation principles and subsequently used the same principles to evaluate the most popular online carbon footprint calculators A recent studys results by Carnegie Mellon's Christopher Weber found that the calculation of carbon footprints for products is often filled with large uncertainties The variables of owning electronic goods such as the production shipment and previous technology used to make that product can make it difficult to create an accurate carbon footprint It is important to question and address the accuracy of Carbon Footprint techniques especially due to its overwhelming popularity \n Carbon Footprints can be reduced through the development of alternative projects such as solar and wind energy which are environment friendly renewable resources or reforestation the restocking of existing forests or woodlands that have previously been depleted These examples are known as Carbon Offsetting the counteracting of carbon dioxide emissions with an equivalent reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \n The main influences on carbon footprints include population economic output and energy and carbon intensity of the economy \n These factors are the main targets of individuals and businesses in order to decrease carbon footprints Production creates a large carbon footprint scholars suggest that decreasing the amount of energy needed for production would be one of the most effective ways to decrease a carbon footprint This is due to the fact that Electricity is responsible for roughly 37% of Carbon Dioxide emissions

products but also includes emissions from all other food then goods followed lastly by services The carbon footprint of U S households is about times greater than the global average which is

Specification \n i e not a standard PAS \n and is being actively piloted by The Carbon Trust and various industrial partners \n As of August The Carbon Trust state they have measured certifiable product carbon footprints \n Evaluating the package of some products is key to figuring out the carbon footprint \n The key way to determine a carbon footprint is to look at the materials used to make the item For example a juice carton is made of an aseptic carton a beer can is made of aluminum and some water bottles either made of glass or plastic The larger the size the larger the footprint will be \n Food \n Low carbon diet \n In a study by Scarborough et al the real-life diets of British people were surveyed and their dietary \n greenhouse gas footprints \n estimated \n Average dietary

dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and the emissions of other GHGs are often associated with the burning of fossil fuels like natural gas crude oil and coal While this is harmful to the environment \n carbon offsets \n can be purchased in an attempt to make up for these harmful effects \n The \n Kyoto Protocol \n defines legally binding targets and timetables for cutting the GHG emissions of industrialized countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol Accordingly from an economic or market perspective one has to distinguish between a \n mandatory market \n and a \n voluntary market \n Typical for both markets is the trade with emission certificates \n Certified Emission Reduction \n CER \n Emission Reduction Unit \n ERU \n Verified Emission Reduction \n VER \n Mandatory market

\n - Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the JI mechanism generate \n Emission Reduction Units \n ERUs \n The CERs and ERUs can then be sold through \n Emissions Trading \n The demand for the CERs and ERUs being traded is driven by \n - Shortfalls in national emission reduction obligations under the Kyoto Protocol \n - Shortfalls amongst entities obligated under local emissions reduction schemes \n Nations which have failed to deliver their Kyoto emissions reductions obligations can enter \n Emissions Trading \n to purchase CERs and ERUs to cover their treaty shortfalls Nations and groups of nations can also create local emission reduction schemes which place mandatory carbon dioxide emission targets on entities within their national boundaries If the rules of a scheme allow the obligated entities may be able to cover all or some of any reduction shortfalls by purchasing CERs and ERUs through \n Emissions Trading \n While local emissions reduction schemes have no status under the \n Kyoto Protocol \n itself they play a prominent role in creating the demand for CERs and ERUs stimulating \n Emissions Trading \n and setting a \n market price \n for emissions \n A well-known mandatory local emissions trading scheme is the \n EU Emissions Trading Scheme \n EU ETS \n New changes are being made to the trading schemes The \n EU Emissions Trading Scheme \n is set to make some new changes within the next year The new changes will target the emissions produced by flight travel in and out of the European Union \n Other nations are scheduled to start participating in Emissions Trading Schemes within the next few year These nations include China India and the United States \n Voluntary market mechanisms \n In contrast to the strict rules set out for the mandatory market the voluntary market provides companies with different options to acquire emissions reductions A solution comparable with those developed for the mandatory market has been developed for the voluntary market the Verified Emission Reductions VER This measure has the great advantage that the projects/activities are managed according to the quality standards set out for CDM/JI projects but the certificates provided are not registered by the governments of the host countries or the Executive Board of the UNO As such high quality VERs can be acquired at lower costs for the same project quality However at present VERs can not be used in the mandatory market \n The voluntary market in North America is divided between members of the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Over The Counter OTC market The \n Chicago Climate Exchange \n is a voluntary yet legally binding \n cap-and-trade emission scheme \n whereby members commit to the capped emission reductions and must purchase allowances from other members or offset excess emissions The OTC market does not involve a legally binding scheme and a wide array of buyers from the public and private spheres as well as special events that want to go \n carbon neutral \n Being carbon neutral refers to achieving net zero carbon emissions by balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset or buying enough carbon credits to make up the difference \n There are project developers wholesalers brokers and retailers as well as carbon funds in the voluntary market Some businesses and nonprofits in the voluntary market encompass more than just one of the activities listed above A report by Ecosystem Marketplace shows that carbon offset prices increase as it moves along the supply chainfrom project developer to retailer \n While some mandatory emission reduction schemes exclude forest projects these projects flourish in the voluntary markets A major criticism concerns the imprecise nature of GHG sequestration quantification methodologies for forestry projects However others note the community co-benefits that \n forestry \n projects foster Project types in the voluntary market range from avoided \n deforestation \n afforestation/reforestation industrial gas \n sequestration \n increased \n energy efficiency \n fuel switching \n methane capture \n from coal plants and \n livestock \n and even \n renewable energy \n Renewable Energy Certificates RECs sold on the voluntary market are quite controversial due to \n additionality \n concerns \n Industrial Gas projects receive criticism because such projects only apply to large industrial plants that already have high fixed costs Siphoning off industrial gas for sequestration is considered picking the low hanging fruit which is why credits generated from industrial gas projects are the cheapest in the voluntary market \n The size and activity of the voluntary carbon market is difficult to measure The most comprehensive report on the voluntary carbon markets to date was released by Ecosystem Marketplace and New Carbon Finance in July \n ON \n of Japan is firstly approved by Japanese authority to indicate carbon footprint on three \n private brand \n goods in October \n Ways to reduce carbon footprint \n The most common way to reduce the carbon footprint of humans is to \n Reduce Reuse Recycle Refuse \n In manufacturing this can be done by recycling the packing materials by selling the obsolete inventory of one industry to the industry who is looking to buy unused items at lesser price to become competitive Nothing should be disposed off into the soil all the ferrous materials which are prone to degrade or oxidize with time should be sold as early as possible at reduced price \n This can also be done by using reusable items such as thermoses for daily coffee or plastic containers for water and other cold beverages rather than disposable ones If that option isn't available it is best to properly recycle the disposable items after use When one household recycles at least half of their household waste they can save tons of carbon dioxide annually \n unreliable source? \n Another easy option is to drive less By walking or biking to the destination rather than driving not only is a person going to save money on gas but they will be burning less fuel and releasing fewer emissions into the atmosphere However if walking is not an option one can look into \n carpooling \n or \n mass transportation \n options in their area \n Yet another option for reducing the \n carbon \n footprint of humans is to use less air conditioning and heating in the home By adding insulation to the walls and attic of one's home and installing \n weather stripping \n or \n caulking \n around doors and windows one can lower their heating costs more than percent Similarly one can very inexpensively upgrade the \"insulation\" clothing worn by residents of the home \n For example it's estimated that wearing a base layer of long underwear top and bottom made from a lightweight super insulating fabric like microfleece \n aka \n Polartec Capilene can conserve as much body heat as a full set of clothing allowing a person to remain warm with the thermostat lowered by over 5C \n These measures all help because they reduce the amount of energy needed to heat and cool the house One can also turn down the heat while sleeping at night or away during the day and keep temperatures moderate at all times Setting the thermostat just degrees lower in winter and higher in summer could save about ton of \n carbon dioxide \n each year \n unreliable source? \n Choice of diet is a major influence on a person's carbon footprint Animal sources of protein especially red meat rice typically produced in high methane-emitting paddies foods transported long distance and/or via fuel-inefficient transport e g highly perishable produce flown long distance and heavily processed and packaged foods are among the major contributors to a high carbon diet Scientists at the University of Chicago have estimated \n \"that the average American diet which derives 28% of its calories from animal foods is responsible for approximately one and a half more tonnes of greenhouse gasses as CO2 equivalents per person per year than a fully plant-based or vegan diet \" \n Their calculations suggest that even replacing one third of the animal protein in the average American's diet with plant protein e g beans grains can reduce the diet's carbon footprint by half a tonne Exchanging two thirds of the animal protein with plant protein is roughly equivalent to switching from a Toyota Camry to a Prius Finally throwing food out not only adds its associated carbon emissions to a person or household's footprint it adds the emissions of transporting the wasted food to the garbage dump and the emissions of food decomposition mostly in the form of the highly potent greenhouse gas methane \n The carbon handprint movement emphasizes individual forms of carbon offsetting like using more public transportation or planting trees in deforested regions to reduce one's carbon footprint and increase their \"handprint \" \n Furthermore the \n carbon \n footprint in the \n food \n industry can be reduced by optimizing the \n supply chain \n A life cycle or supply chain \n carbon \n footprint study can provide useful data which will help the business to identify critical areas for improvement and provides a focus Such studies also demonstrate a companys commitment to reducing carbon footprint now ahead of other competitors as well as preparing companies for potential regulation In addition to increased market advantage and differentiation eco-efficiency can also help to reduce costs where \n alternative energy \n systems are implemented \n GHG footprint \n The \n GHG footprint \n or greenhouse gas footprint refers to the amount of GHG that are emitted during the creation of products or services It is more comprehensive than the commonly used carbon footprint which measures only carbon dioxide one of many greenhouse gases One of methodologies used for the estimation of GHG footprint is \n Life Cycle Assessment LCA \n A life cycle assessment assesses multiple environmental impact categories typically including categories assessing the human health

type of \n sanitation \n system which strives to be \"sustainable\" in all respects According to the definition by the \n Sustainable Sanitation Alliance \n a sustainable sanitation system should meet the following five criteria it should be economically viable socially acceptable technically appropriate institutionally appropriate and protective of the environment and the natural resources \n The purpose of sustainable sanitation like sanitation in general is to protect and promote human health by providing a clean environment that reduces \n disease \n particularly by transmission via the \n fecal-oral route \n Sustainable sanitation defined in this way may or may not have an emphasis on \n reuse of excreta \n This approach to sanitation requires a systems approach rather than only focussing on the \n toilet \n itself \n The experience of the user waste collection methods transportation or conveyance of waste waste treatment and reuse or disposal all need to be thoroughly assessed \n Terminology \n Comparison with \"improved sanitation\" \n Comparison with ecosan \n Sustainability criteria \n Health \n Environment and natural resources \n Technology and operation \n

Pit System Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies \n Comparison with \"improved sanitation\" \n Further information \n Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation \n The \n Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation \n JMP of the WHO \n World Health Organisation \n and UNICEF \n United Nations Children's Fund \n was responsible for monitoring progress towards the \n Millennium Development Goal \n for drinking water and sanitation For reasons of simplicity being able to monitor the sanitation situation with household surveys the JMP had to find a simple differentiation between \"improved\" sanitation toilets that count towards the MDG goals and \"unimproved\" sanitation toilets that do not count towards the MDG goals \n According to the JMP definition \n improved sanitation \n facilities include facilities which are \n not shared or \n public \n and \n which are one of the following toilet types flush or \n pour-flush \n to piped \n sewer \n system \n septic tank \n or \n pit latrine \n ventilated improved pit latrine pit latrine with slab or a \n composting toilet \n Unimproved sanitation facilities according to the JMP include \n flush or pour-flush to elsewhere excreta are flushed to the street yard or plot open sewer a ditch a drainage way or other location \n pit latrine without slab or open pit \n bucket toilet \n hanging toilet or hanging latrine or no facilities or bush or field \n open defecation \n In some circumstances \"improved\" sanitation facilities can be regarded as not sustainable whereas in other circumstances \"unimproved\" sanitation facilities can be regarded as sustainable This is because it depends on the sanitation system of which the toilet is only one part For example a pit latrine with a slab can become unsustainable sanitation if it is \n polluting the groundwater \n or if the faecal sludge that is removed from the pit latrine is dumped into the environment A bucket toilet can become sustainable if the collection treatment and reuse or disposal of excreta is taken care of in a safe manner for example with the \n urine-diverting dry toilets \n that SOIL is employing in Haiti \n Comparison with ecosan \n Sustainable sanitation defined with the five sustainability criteria may or may not have an emphasis on \n reuse of excreta \n because the criterion of \"protecting the natural resources\" is only one of several that need to be strived towards In comparison \n ecological sanitation \n ecosan has a strong focus on the reuse of excreta \n Sustainability criteria \n The main objective of a sanitation system is to protect and promote human health by providing a clean environment and breaking the cycle of disease In order to be sustainable a sanitation system has to be not only economically viable socially acceptable and technically and institutionally appropriate but it should also protect the environment and the \n natural resources \n According to the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance when improving an existing and/or designing a new sanitation system \n sustainability \n criteria related to the following aspects should be considered \n Health \n Poorly handled fecal sludge poses high health risks lots of spillage and no \n personal protective equipmen \n t for the workers \n Health aspects include the risk of exposure to \n pathogens \n and hazardous substances that could affect public health at all points of the sanitation system from the toilet via the collection and treatment system to the point of reuse or disposal The topic also covers aspects such as \n hygiene \n nutrition \n and the improvement of livelihood achieved by the application of a certain sanitation system as well as downstream effects \n Environment and natural resources \n Environment and natural resources aspects involve the required energy water and other natural resources for construction operation and maintenance of the system as well as the potential emissions to the environment resulting from use It also includes the degree of recycling and \n reuse of excreta \n practiced and the effects of these for example reusing the \n wastewater \n returning nutrients and organic material to agriculture and the protecting of other non-renewable resources for example through the production of \n renewable energy \n e g \n biogas \n or fuel wood \n Technology and operation \n Technology and operation aspects incorporate the functionality and the ease with which the system can be constructed operated and monitored using the available human resources e g the local community technical team of the local utility etc It also concerns the suitability to achieve an efficient substance flow management from a technical point of view Furthermore it evaluates the robustness of the system its vulnerability towards disasters and the flexibility and adaptability of its technical elements to the existing infrastructure to demographic and socio-economic developments and \n climate change \n Finance and economics \n Financial and economic issues relate to the capacity of households and communities to pay for sanitation including the construction maintenance and depreciation of the system Besides the evaluation of investment operation and maintenance costs the topic also takes into account the economic benefits that can be obtained in productive sanitation systems including benefits from the production of the recyclables soil conditioner \n fertiliser \n energy and \n reclaimed water \n employment creation increased \n productivity \n through improved health and the reduction of environmental and public health costs \n Socio-cultural and institutional aspects \n Socio-cultural and institutional aspects take into account the socio-cultural acceptance and appropriateness of the system convenience system perceptions \n gender \n issues and impacts on \n human dignity \n the contribution to \n subsistence \n economies and food security and legal and institutional aspects \n Planning for sustainable sanitation \n Most sanitation systems have been designed with the five aspects in mind but in practice they are failing far too often because some of the criteria are not met Since there is no one-for-all sanitation solution which fulfils the sustainability criteria evaluation will depend on the local framework and will have to take into consideration the existing environmental technical socio-cultural and economic conditions \n Some basic principles to be observed when planning and implementing a sustainable sanitation system were endorsed by the members of the \n Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council \n the Bellagio Principles for Sustainable Sanitation during its 5th Global Forum in November \n Human dignity quality of life and environmental security at household level should be at the centre of any sanitation approach \n In line with good governance principles decision-making should involve participation of all stakeholders especially the consumers and providers of services \n Waste \n should be considered a resource and its management should be holistic and form part of integrated water resource nutrient flow and waste management processes \n The domain in which environmental sanitation problems are resolved should be kept to the minimum practicable size household community town district catchment city \n These planning guidelines have been revised further and are now used in various training courses for urban planners \n Examples \n Some examples for improving present sanitation practices in the short-term purely from a \n technology perspective \n are listed below \n Pit latrines could be modified to be soil-composting latrines \n Arborloos \n thus requiring some wall reinforcement made shallow max 1-1 m and maintained using daily soil additions the pits would be periodically closed and covered with soil in order to allow for sanitization and composting prior to emptying and reuse in agriculture \n Simple \n urinals \n with separate collector systems could be installed instead of using toilets and pit latrines for urination \n Flush toilets \n could be modified to use less water or reuse greywater \n Greywater \n could be source-separated from the \n blackwater \n from toilets thus simplifying its treatment and providing opportunities for reuse \n Blackwater from toilets could be held in conservancy tanks instead of open septic tanks and cess pits and then emptied and transported to biogas reactors alternatively the toilets could be connected to biogas reactors \n Cess or drainage pits e g from pour-flush toilets could be equipped with a safety zone of additional filter material to prevent contamination of ground water \n Above ground dry toilets with \n urine diversion \n could be installed in dry areas lacking water rocky areas where pits are expensive to dig and areas with high water tables and flooding \n With respect to the other sustainability factors key areas of attention the creation of an enabling environment market development and capacity development \n Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \n -

Cost-benefit analysis and policy implications \n Background \n The first report to draw a relationship between race income and risk of exposure to pollutants was the Council of Environmental Quality's \"Annual Report to the President\" in \n After protests in \n Warren County North Carolina \n the \n United Church of Christ \n commissioned a report exploring the concept \n In \n Robert D Bullard \n a \n sociologist \n at \n Texas Southern University \n completed a report describing the futile attempt of an affluent African-American community in Houston Texas to block the siting of a hazardous waste landfill in their community This paper provided \n evidence \n that race not just income status was a probable factor in this local \"uninvited\" land-use decision In \n Sidney Howe \n Director of the Human Environment Center suggested that people positioned in a lower socioeconomic level of their respective communities were exposed to more pollution than others and that those creating the most pollution live in the least polluted places He used the term environmental justice to describe the corrective measures needed to address this disparity \n Those claims have not been evaluated \n During the 1980s African-Americans began organizing environmental campaigns to avoid poisoning farm workers with pesticides \n lead poisoning \n in inner-city children the zoning of toxic facilities such as landfills polluting industrial complexes and incinerators In addition many Americans questioned the placement of large numbers of nuclear waste dumps on Native-American reservations Meanwhile activists scholars and policymakers began investigating the link between race and exposure to environmental hazards Two studies exploring this relationshipone by the U S \n General Accounting Office \n US GAO and the other by the \n United Church of Christ \n UCC found that African-Americans and other people of color were more likely to live close to hazardous waste sites and facilities than whites The study by the UCC was particularly important because it made an explicit connection between race and the increased likelihood of being exposed to hazardous wastes The studies also made the issue of race and the environment more salient in communities of color \n The term \n environmental racism \n came into use at a conference held at the \n University of Michigan \n 's School of Natural Resources in The conference which focused on race and environmental hazards brought together scholars and policymakers to discuss the relationship between racism and the environment In addition the term environmental equity movement was used in the late 1980s to describe the growing movement to address racial gender and class environmental inequalities \n In this line of thinking environmental racism includes but is not limited to greater probability of exposure to environmental hazards uneven negative effects of environmental procedures uneven negative effects of environmental policies intentional targeting and zoning of toxic facilities in minority communities segregation of minority workers in hazardous jobs minority communities with little access to or insufficient maintenance of environmental amenities for example parks and disproportionate access to environmental services such as garbage removal \n Definition \n One area of contention relating to the definition of the term is intent Some definitions hold that only intentional discrimination against minorities in issues regarding the environment is what constitutes environmental racism while others focus on the presence of unfavorable environmental conditions for minorities intentional or not \n Benjamin Chavis \n African American \n civil rights \n leader highlighted the importance of intent stating that \"environmental racism is racial discrimination in environmental policy-making and enforcement of regulations and laws the deliberate targeting of communities of color for toxic waste facilities the official sanctioning of the presence of life threatening poisons and pollutants for communities of color and the history of excluding people of color from leadership of the environmental movement\" \n Those who are critical of this viewpoint suggest that it is restrictive because deliberate racism is just one of a variety of forms of racism \n Even if it's not intentional some groups for a number of reasons are more likely to be present in areas of environmental hazard and pollution than others Thus lack of intentionality doesn't necessarily mean that it's not environmental racism The difficulty of proving group intent versus individual intent is one of the reasons why the intentionality requirement found in some definitions is seen as limiting \n United States \n The \n U S Government Accountability Office \n GAO issued a report addressing correlations between the siting of four \n hazardous waste \n facilities and the racial background of an area's residents \n Opposing hazardous waste sites requires time money and political engagement Resources such as meeting places access to public records and funding for technical assistance are also required for action \n Minority groups may not access to these resources creating challenges for groups fighting against the placement of unwanted land use Further controversial projects are less likely to be sited in areas expected to pursue \n collective action \n Some studies suggest that the lack of opposition to these hazardous sites could be due to economic impacts in a given area where jobs in a community are dependent on the site \n Non-minority communities are more likely to succeed when opposing the siting of hazardous waste and sewage treatment facilities incinerators and freeways in their areas \n Non-minority communities have better opportunities to access these tools and resources for preventing the placement of toxic sites as well as the negative impacts of environmental policy decisions \n While some social scientists see the siting of hazardous facilities in minority communities as a demonstration of intentional racism whereby these communities are targeted for prejudicial reasons belief in racial inferiority or a desire to protect racial group privilege \n others see the causes of environmental racism as structural and institutional The traditional perspective views discrimination as more individualistic sporadic and episodic than the institutional perspective \n Processes such as \n suburbanization \n gentrification \n and decentralization lead to patterns of environmental racism even absent intentionally discriminatory policies For example the process of suburbanization or \n white flight \n consists of non-minorities leaving industrial zones for safer cleaner and less expensive suburban locales Meanwhile minority communities are left in the inner cities and in close proximity to polluted industrial zones In these areas unemployment is high and businesses are less likely to invest in area improvement creating poor economic conditions for residents and reinforcing a social formation that reproduces racial inequality \n Furthermore the poverty of property owners and residents in a municipality may be taken into consideration by hazardous waste facility developers since areas with depressed real estate values will cut expenses \n Cases \n Flint Michigan \n Flint water crisis \n Since April residents of \n Flint \n a city that is almost percent black and notably impoverished have been drinking and bathing in water that contains enough lead to meet the Environmental Protection Agency's definition of \"toxic waste\" Before when the city of Flint switched to their own river as means of water Lake Huron provided the area with water Researchers at Virginia Tech discovered in that the Flint River is times more corrosive than Lake Huron Lead contamination can engender multiple health conditions A November class-action lawsuit describes how Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality failed to treat the new water source with an anti-corrosive agent thereby causing the water to become increasingly discolored Adding that agent orthophosphate would have cost $100 per day according to CNN and percent of the problems with Flint's water would have been averted if it had been used \n Warren County North Carolina \n Warren County PCB Landfill \n Racism and environmental justice unified for the first time during the citizen opposition to a proposed PCB landfill in Warren County North Carolina \n North Carolina state officials decided to bury soil contaminated with toxic polychlorinated biphenyls in Afton a small town in Warren County \n Between June and August gallons of polychlorinated biphenyls PCB -contaminated waste were illegally deposited along miles of North Carolina roads The U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA declared the PCBs a threat to public health and required the state to remove the polluted waste In the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources and EPA Region selected Warren County as the site to deposit the PCB-contaminated soil that was collected from the roadsides \n Warren County is one of the six counties along the \"black belt\" of North Carolina The counties residing in the \"black belt\" are significantly poorer than the rest of the state In the early 1980s the residents in Warren County earned an average per capita income of $6 compared to $9 for the rest of the state \n In the population of Warren County was 5% African-American \n Scientific findings did not support the decision to discharge the PCB contaminated soil in Warren County The site of the landfill was not scientifically feasible due to the shallow water table with the drinking water only feet below the surface \n In the local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People filed a lawsuit in the district courts to block the landfill The residents lost the case in court \n In September the outraged citizens of Warren County joined by civil rights groups environmental leaders and clergymen protested the first truckloads of PCB contaminated soil \n During the protest over people were arrested and jailed Despite protests and scientific evidence that the plan would cause drinking water contamination \n the \n Warren County PCB Landfill \n was built and the toxic waste was placed in the landfill \n After nearly two decades of suspected leaks state and federal sources paid a contractor $18 million to detoxify the PCB contaminated soil in Warren County \n Warren County is often cited as the first environmental justice case in the United States however this movement started years earlier in with the discovery of toxic waste in Love Canal New York \n Chicago Illinois \n Altgeld Gardens \n is a housing community located in south Chicago that was built in on an abandoned landfill to accommodate returning \n African-American \n World War II \n veterans Surrounded by toxic facilities and 90% of the city's landfills the Altgeld Gardens area became known as a \"toxic doughnut\" With 90% of its population African-American and 65% below the poverty level Altgeld Gardens is considered a classic example of environmental racism \n The known toxins and pollutants affecting the Altgeld Gardens area include \n mercury \n ammonia \n gas \n lead \n dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane \n DDT \n polychlorinated biphenyls \n PCBs \n polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons \n PAHs \n heavy metals \n and \n xylene \n The residents of Altgeld Gardens are surrounded by landfills a chemical waste incinerator and piles of loose trash These living conditions have affected the health of the community In a study by Illinois Public Health Sector revealed excessive rates of prostate bladder and lung cancer \n Additionally medical records have indicated high rates of children born with brain tumors high rates of fetuses that had to be aborted after tests revealed that the brains were developing outside the skull and higher rates of asthma ringworm and other ailments Despite evidence of health problems the residents of Altgeld Gardens have not been relocated to another public housing project \n Chester Pennsylvania \n Chester Pennsylvania \n provides an example of \"social political and economic forces that shape the disproportionate distribution of environmental hazards in poor communities of color\" \n Chester is located in \n Delaware County \n an area with a population of that excluding Chester is 91% \n white \n Chester however is 65% African American with the highest minority population and poverty rate in Delaware County \n and recipient of a disproportionate amount of environmental risks and hazards \n Chester has five large waste facilities including a trash incinerator a medical waste incinerator and a sewage treatment plant \n These waste sites in Chester have a total permitted capacity of million tons of waste per year while the rest of Delaware County has a capacity of merely tons per year \n One of the waste sites located in Chester is the Westinghouse incinerator which burns all of the municipal waste from the entire county and surrounding states \n These numerous waste facilities engender very significant health risks to the citizens of Chester as the cancer rate in this area is times higher than it is anywhere else in Pennsylvania \n Also the mortality rate is 40% higher than the rest of Delaware county and the child mortality rate is the highest \n The clustering of all of these polluting facilities in Chester points to environmental racism \n New Orleans Louisiana \n People on the roofs of their houses avoiding the flood \n New Orleans \n Louisiana \n has been cited as an example of past environmental racism At the time of \n Hurricane Katrina \n 5% of New Orleans residents were African Americana rate nearly 50% higher than in the rest of the United States Pre-existing racial disparities in wealth within New Orleans worsened the outcome of Hurricane Katrina for minority populations Institutionalized \n racial segregation of neighborhoods \n left minority members more likely to live in low-lying areas that were more vulnerable to the devastating effects of the Hurricane \n Additionally hurricane evacuation plans relied heavily on the use of cars and personal vehicles However because minority populations are less likely to own cars some people had no choice but to stay behind while white majority communities were able to escape A report commissioned by the \n U S House of Representatives \n found that political leaders failed to consider the fact that \"100 city residents had no cars and relied on public transit\" and the city's failure to complete its mandatory evacuation led to hundreds of deaths \n In the months following the disaster political religious and civil rights groups celebrities and New Orleans residents spoke out against what they believed was racism on the part of the United States government \n After the hurricane in a meeting held between the Congressional Black Caucus the National Urban League the Black Leadership Forum the National Council of Negro Women and the NAACP Black leaders criticized the response of the federal government calling it \"slow and incomplete\" and discussed the role of race in this response \n Effects on Native American nations \n Indian removal \n A pile of \n American bison \n skulls they were hunted almost to \n extinction \n in the 1870s The \n United States Army \n encouraged these \n massive hunts \n to force Native Americans off their traditional lands and into reservations further west \n The \n Indian Removal Act of \n and the \n Trail of Tears \n may be considered early examples of environmental racism in the United States By all tribes east of the Mississippi had been removed to western lands essentially confining them to \"lands that were too dry remote or barren to attract the attention of settlers and corporations\" \n Later during World War II military facilities were often located conterminous to reservations leading to a situation in which \"a disproportionate number of the most dangerous military facilities are located near Native American lands\" \n More recently Native American lands have been used for waste disposal by the United States and multinational corporations \n but illegal dumping poses a greater threat \n The International Tribunal of Indigenous People and Oppressed Nations convened in established to examine the history of criminal activity against indigenous groups in the United States \n published a Significant Bill of Particulars outlining grievances indigenous peoples had with the U S including allegations that the United States \"deliberately and systematically permitted aided and abetted solicited and conspired to commit the dumping transportation and location of nuclear toxic medical and otherwise hazardous waste materials on Native American territories in North America and has thus created a clear and present danger to the health safety and physical and mental well-being of Native American People\" \n An ongoing issue for Native Americans activists would be the \n Dakota Access Pipeline \n The pipeline would start in North Dakota and travel to Illinois Although it does not cross directly on a reservation the pipeline is under scrutiny because it passes under a section of the Missouri river which is a key water source for Native American tribes such as the Standing Rock Sioux The pipeline also traverses a sacred burial ground for the Standing Rock Sioux The tribe is upset because they argue the federal government did not adequately engage the Standing Rock Sioux during the permitting process which is required by the Federal Government \n Homer Forest Grove and Center Springs Louisiana \n In the Louisiana Energy Services LES a British German and American conglomerate conducted a nationwide search to find the \"best\" site to build a privately owned uranium enrichment plant The LES claimed to use an objective scientific method to select Louisiana as the \"best\" place to build the plant In response to the selection the communities of Homer Forest Grove and Center Springs that are nearby the proposed site formed a group called Citizens against Nuclear Trash CANT With the help of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund later changed to Earth Justice Legal Defense Fund CANT sued LES for practicing environmental racism Finally after years on May a three-judge panel of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board made their final initial decision The panel found that racial bias did play a role in the selection process In response to the victory on May the London Times declared \"Louisiana Blacks Win Nuclear War\" The courts decision was also upheld on appeal on April \n The \n neutrality \n of the style of writing in this article is \n questioned \n Please do not remove this message until \n conditions to do so are met \n May \n Learn how

of Diamond faced due to being a minority filled neighborhood Louisiana has a strip that is covered in chemical factories which is extremely harmful to the people who inhabit these neighborhoods near the chemical corridor Diamond is a case of a neighborhood where Shell gas company moved in and started to pollute and poison the people of Diamond due to chemical emissions in the air The people of Diamond started to experience illness and an uprising of asthma in their children and cancer all around The residents of Diamond seemed to be dying off left and right The Shell company refused to acknowledge the damage that was so obviously happening to the residents because their \"testing\" showed that they were at the standards set for them Shell offered to buy out the homes that the residents owned however the property value was so low due to Shell that it wouldn't have allowed the residents to get new housing Eventually after protesting and making the issue a public matter shell eventually agreed to relocate the residents Lerner \n International \n Environmental racism also exists on an international scale Environmental racism on a world scale exists between groups in the developed world and groups in the developing world and between different races and ethnicities on different continents \n First world \n corporations often produce dangerous chemicals banned in the United States and export them to developing countries or send waste materials to countries with relaxed environmental laws This has been described as environmental racism \n In one alleged instance the French aircraft carrier \n Clemenceau \n was prohibited from entering \n Alang \n an \n Indian \n ship-breaking yard due to a lack of clear documentation about its toxic contents French President \n Jacques Chirac \n ultimately ordered the carrier which contained tons of hazardous materials including \n asbestos \n and \n PCBs \n to return to \n France \n In another example of alleged foreign environmental racism in both the Union Carbide chemical plant in \n Bhopal India \n and the PEMEX liquid propane gas plant in \n Mexico City \n blew up killing thousands and injuring roughly a million nearby residents \n The images of the victims in \n India \n and \n Mexico \n spread interest in environmental racism around the globe On the other hand some countries have small \"eco laws\" and are more prone to accept dangerous industries \n Cases \n Electronic waste in Guiyu China \n Electronics companies are constantly coming out with new technologies rendering old models obsolete These older technologies can be sent to recycling depots for proper dismantling however there is a large component of technology that gets shipped overseas to less developed countries for inexpensive labour-intensive recycling From the mid-1990s until about it is estimated that some to percent of the electronics collected for recycling in the western half of the United States was being exported for dismantling overseas predominantly to China and Southeast Asia \n This scrap processing is quite profitable due to an abundant workforce and cheap labour \n Proper disposal and recycling of these electronics is difficult labour-intensive and therefore expensive \n As a result large quantities of the waste are shipped overseas to places where the labour is cheap and the environmental laws are lax \n These electronics produce vast amounts of waste when not properly dismantled or disposed of \n E-waste \n disposal sites such as one in \n Guiyu \n China \n are also subjects of controversy In the town heaps of discarded computer parts rise near the riverbanks and their toxic substances such as \n cadmium \n copper \n lead \n PBDEs \n and numerous persistent organic compounds seep into and poison the local water supply \n Water samples taken by the \n Basel Action Network \n in from the Lianjiang River contained lead levels times higher than WHO safety standards \n After the e-waste began arriving the groundwater in Guiyu became undrinkable As a consequence the villages must get their drinking water trucked in which is quite expensive causing people to still use the contaminated water for some activities \n These chemicals and toxins bioaccumulate in fatty tissue and biomagnify up the food chain \n In Guiyu labourers with no protective clothing regularly burn plastics and circuit boards from old computers They pour acid on electronic parts to extract \n silver \n and \n gold \n and crush \n cathode ray tubes \n from computer monitors to remove other valuable metals such as lead Nearly percent of children in the \n e-waste hub of Guiyu China \n suffer from lead poisoning according to recent reports \n Much of the area of Guiyu before the electronic waste was agriculturally based with many small farmers making their living \n Farming has been abandoned for more lucrative work in scrap electronics \n \"According to the Western press and both Chinese university and NGO researchers conditions in these workers' rural villages are so poor that even the primitive electronic scrap industry in Guiyu offers an improvement in income\" \n There were more incentives for the residents of Guiyu to move from farming to electronics dismantling The citizens of Guiyu more than likely did not have significant political influence or the capital to stop electronic waste coming into the area \n Chevron/Texaco in Ecuador \n Aftermath of Lago Agrio oil field \n Due to their lack of environmental laws emerging countries like \n Ecuador \n have been subjected to environmental pollution sometimes causing health problems loss of agriculture and poverty In Ecuadorians which included \n Cofan \n Siona \n Huaorani \n and Quichua indigenous people filed a lawsuit against \n Texaco oil company \n for the environmental damages caused by oil extraction activities in the \n Lago Agrio oil field \n After handing control of the oil fields to an Ecuadorian oil company Texaco did not properly dispose of its hazardous waste causing great damages to the ecosystem and crippling communities \n Union Carbide chemical leak in Bhopal India \n Bhopal disaster \n The main corporation \n Union Carbide Corporation \n is the parent company of Union Carbide India Limited The company outsourced its production to another country Union Carbide India Limited was located in \n Bhopal India \n and primarily produced the chemical \n methyl isocyanate \n used for pesticide manufacture \n On December a cloud of methyl isocyanate leaked as a result of the toxic chemical mixing with water in the plant in Bhopal \n Approximately people were exposed to the toxic chemical immediately after the leak \n Within the first days after the leak an estimated people living within the vicinity of the plant died from exposure to the methyl isocyanate \n Some people survived the initial leak from the factory but due to improper care and improper diagnoses many have died \n As a consequence of improper diagnoses treatment may have been ineffective and this was precipitated by Union Carbide refusing to release all the details regarding the leaked gases and lying about certain important information \n The delay in supplying medical aid to the victims of the chemical leak made the situation for the survivors even worse \n Many today are still experiencing the negative health impacts of the methyl isocyanate leak such as lung fibrosis impaired vision \n tuberculosis \n neurological disorders \n severe body pains and many more medical conditions \n The operations and maintenance of the factory in Bhopal contributed to the hazardous chemical leak The storage of huge volumes of methyl isocyanate in a densely inhabited area was in contravention with company policies strictly practiced in other plants \n The company ignored protests that they were holding too much of the dangerous chemical for one plant and built large tanks to hold it in a crowded community \n Methyl isocyanate must be stored at extremely low temperatures but the company cut expenses to the air conditioning system leading to less than optimal conditions for the chemical \n Union Carbide India Limited never created disaster management plans for the surrounding community around the factory in the event of a leak or spill \n State authorities were in the pocket of the company and therefore did not pay attention to company practices or implementation of the law \n The company also cut down on preventative maintenance staff to save money \n The company cut corners in order to save some money creating conditions for the leak to occur \n Niger Delta Nigeria \n Further information \n Environmental issues in the Niger Delta \n In Nigeria near the \n Niger Delta \n cases of \n oil spills \n burning of \n toxic waste \n and urban \n air pollution \n are problems in more developed areas In the early 1990s Nigeria was among the nations with the world's highest levels of \n carbon dioxide emissions \n which totaled kilotons a per capita level of metric tons The UN reported in that carbon dioxide emissions in Nigeria totaled kilotons \n Numerous webpages were created in support of the \n Ogoni people \n who are indigenous to Nigeria's oil-rich Delta region Sites were used to protest the disastrous environmental and economic effects of \n Shell Oil \n drilling to urge the boycotting of Shell Oil and to denounce \n human rights abuses \n by the Nigerian government and by Shell The use of the Internet in formulating an international appeal intensified dramatically after the Nigerian government's November execution of nine Ogoni activists including \n Ken Saro-Wiwa \n who was one of the founders of the nonviolent Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People MOSOP \n Responses \n There are many proposed solutions to the problem of environmental racism Activists have called for \"more participatory and citizen-centered conceptions of justice\" \n According to the \n United Nations \n Conference on Environment and Development one possible solution is the \n precautionary principle \n which states that \"where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation\" \n Under this principle the initiator of the potentially hazardous activity is charged with demonstrating the activity's safety Environmental justice activists also emphasize the need for waste reduction in general which would act to reduce the overall burden \n Concentrations of ethnic or racial minorities may also foster solidarity lending support in spite of challenges and providing the concentration of \n social capital \n necessary for grassroots activism Citizens who are tired of being subjected to the dangers of pollution in their communities have been confronting the power structures through organized protest legal actions marches civil disobedience and other activities \n There should be more avenues for public participation and public consultation in the decision making processes \n Other strategies in battling against large companies include public hearings the elections of supporters to state and local offices meetings with company representatives and other efforts to bring about public awareness and accountability \n In general political participation in African American communities is correlated with the reduction of health risks and mortality \n Studies \n The protests in Warren County North Carolina in to prevent the siting of a polychlorinated biphenyls landfill in the county became the driving force to a US General Accounting Office study \"Siting of Hazardous Waste Landfills and Their Correlation with Racial and Economic Status of Surrounding Communities\" The study revealed that \"three of the four commercial hazardous waste landfills in the Southeast United States were located in majority black communities \" The General Accounting Office Study or GAO study solely studied off-site hazardous waste landfills in the Southeastern United States limiting the scope \n In response to this limitation the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice or CRJ directed a comprehensive national study on demographic patterns associated with the location of hazardous waste sites \n The CRJ national study conducted two examinations of areas surrounding commercial hazardous waste facilities and the location of uncontrolled toxic waste sites \n The first study examined the association between race and socio-economic status and the location of commercial hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facilities \n After statistical analysis the first study concluded that \"the percentage of community residents that belonged to a racial or ethnic group was a stronger predictor of the level of commercial hazardous waste activity than was household income the value of the homes the number of uncontrolled waste sites or the estimated amount of hazardous wastes generated by industry\" \n The second study examined the presence of uncontrolled toxic waste sites in ethnic and racial minority communities and found that out of every African and Hispanic Americans lived in communities with uncontrolled waste sites \n Other studies like the \"Toxic Waste and Race in the United States\" by the Commission for Racial Justice found race to be the most influential variable in predicting where waste facilities were located \n Deserting the Perpetrator - Victim Model of studying environmental justice issues the Economic/Environmental Justice Model utilized a sharper lens to study the many complex factors accompanied to race that contributes to the act of environmental racism and injustice Using this model the role of history and the overlapping of interest groups stakeholders and organizations are considered in case studies of environmental racism For example Lerner in \n Diamond A struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor \n not only revealed the role of race in the division of Diamond and Norco residents but he also revealed the historical roles of the Shell Oil Company the slave ancestry of Diamond residents and of the history of white workers and families that were dependent upon the rewards of Shell Involvement of outside organizations such as the Bucket Brigade and Greenpeace was also considered in the power that the Diamond community had when battling for environmental justice \n Legislation \n The export of hazardous waste to third world countries is another growing concern Between and an estimated metric tons of hazardous waste was exported from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD countries to non-OECD countries Two international agreements were passed in response to the growing exportation of hazardous waste into their borders The Organization of African Unity OAU was concerned that the Basel Convention adopted in March did not include a total ban on the trans-boundary movement on hazardous waste In response to their concerns on January the Pan-African Conference on Environmental and Sustainable Development adopted the Bamako Convention banning the import of all hazardous waste into Africa and limiting their movement within the continent In September the G-77 nations helped amend the Basel Convention to ban the export of all hazardous waste from industrial countries mainly OECD countries and Lichtenstein to other countries \n Cost-benefit analysis and policy implications \n Cost-benefit analysis \n CBA is a process that places a monetary value on costs and benefits to evaluate issues \n Environmental CBA aims to provide policy solutions for intangible products such as clean air and water by measuring a consumer's willingness to pay for these goods CBA contributes to environmental racism through the valuing of environmental resources based on their utility to society The more someone is willing to pay for a resource such as clean water or air benefits society more than when people are not willing to pay for these goods This creates a burden on poorer areas however by relocating toxic wastes and other environmentally hazardous goods through the justification that they are not willing or able to pay as much as a wealthier area for a clean environment The placement of toxic wastes near poor people lowers the property value of already cheap land Since the decrease in property value is less than that of a cleaner wealthier area the monetary benefits to society are greater by dumping the toxic waste in a \"low-value\" area \n Health

according to the principles of \n sustainable development \n Sustainable forest management has to keep the balance between three main pillars \n ecological \n economic and socio-cultural Successfully achieving sustainable forest management will provide integrated benefits to all ranging from safeguarding local livelihoods to protecting the biodiversity and ecosystems provided by forests reducing rural poverty and mitigating some of the effects of climate change \n The \" \n Forest Principles \n \" adopted at \n The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development UNCED \n in Rio de Janeiro in captured the general international understanding of \n sustainable \n forest management at that time A number of sets of \n criteria and indicators \n have since been developed to evaluate the achievement of SFM at the global regional country and management unit level These were all attempts to codify and provide for independent assessment of the degree to which the broader objectives of sustainable forest management are being achieved in practice In the \n United Nations General Assembly \n adopted the \n Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests \n The instrument was the first of its kind and reflected the strong international commitment to promote implementation of sustainable forest management through a new approach that brings all stakeholders together \n citation needed \n Definition \n Criteria and indicators \n Ecosystem approach \n Independent certification \n Forest governance \n National Forest Funds \n Forest genetic resources \n Initiatives \n National reports on progress toward sustainable forest management \n Definition \n A definition of SFM was developed by the \n Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe \n FOREST EUROPE and has since been adopted by the \n Food and Agriculture Organization \n FAO \n It defines sustainable forest management as \n The stewardship and use of \n forests \n and forest lands in a way and at a rate that maintains their biodiversity productivity regeneration capacity vitality and their potential to fulfill now and in the future relevant ecological economic and social functions at local national and global levels and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems \n In simpler terms the concept can be described as the attainment of balance balance between society's increasing demands for forest products and benefits and the preservation of forest health and diversity This balance is critical to the survival of forests and to the prosperity of forest-dependent communities \n For forest managers sustainably managing a particular forest tract means determining in a tangible way how to use it today to ensure similar benefits health and productivity in the future Forest managers must assess and integrate a wide array of sometimes conflicting factors commercial and non-commercial values environmental considerations community needs \n even global impact to produce sound forest plans In most cases forest managers develop their forest plans in consultation with citizens businesses organizations and other interested parties in and around the forest tract being managed The tools and visualization have been recently evolving for better management practices \n The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at the request of Member States developed and launched the \n Sustainable Forest Management Toolbox \n in an online collection of tools \n best practices and examples of their application to support countries implementing sustainable forest management \n Because forests and societies are in constant flux the desired outcome of sustainable forest management is not a fixed one What constitutes a sustainably managed forest will change over time as values held by the public change \n Criteria and indicators \n Deforestation \n of native \n rain forest \n in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of \n clay \n for \n civil engineering \n picture An example of non sustainable forest management \n Criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management \n Criteria and indicators are tools which can be used to conceptualise evaluate and implement sustainable forest management \n Criteria define and characterize the essential elements as well as a set of conditions or processes by which sustainable forest management may be assessed Periodically measured indicators reveal the direction of change with respect to each criterion \n Criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management are widely used and many countries produce national reports that assess their progress toward sustainable forest management There are nine international and regional criteria and indicators initiatives which collectively involve more than countries \n Three of the more advanced initiatives are those of the Working Group on Criteria and Indicators for the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Temperate and Boreal Forests also called the \n Montreal Process \n Forest Europe \n and the \n International Tropical Timber Organization \n Countries who are members of the same initiative usually agree to produce reports at the same time and using the same indicators Within countries at the management unit level efforts have also been directed at developing local level criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management The \n Center for International Forestry Research \n the \n International Model Forest Network \n and researchers at the \n University of British Columbia \n have developed a number of tools and techniques to help forest-dependent communities develop their own local level criteria and indicators \n Criteria and Indicators also form the basis of third-party forest certification programs such as the \n Canadian Standards Association \n 's \n Sustainable Forest Management Standards \n and the \n Sustainable Forestry Initiative \n Standard \n There appears to be growing international consensus on the key elements of sustainable forest management Seven common thematic areas of sustainable forest management have emerged based on the criteria of the nine ongoing regional and international criteria and indicators initiatives The seven thematic areas are \n Extent of forest resources \n Biological diversity \n Forest health \n and vitality \n Productive functions and forest resources \n Protective functions of forest resources \n Socio-economic functions \n Legal policy and institutional framework \n This consensus on common thematic areas or criteria effectively provides a common implicit definition of sustainable forest management The seven thematic areas were acknowledged by the international forest community at the fourth session of the \n United Nations Forum on Forests \n and the 16th session of the Committee on Forestry \n These thematic areas have since been enshrined in the \n Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests \n as a reference framework for sustainable forest management to help achieve the purpose of the instrument \n On January the \n Montreal Process \n Forest Europe \n the \n International Tropical Timber Organization \n and the \n Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \n acknowledging the seven thematic areas endorsed a \n joint statement of collaboration \n to improve global forest related data collection and reporting and avoiding the proliferation of monitoring requirements and associated reporting burdens \n Ecosystem approach \n The \n Ecosystem Approach \n has been prominent on the agenda of the \n Convention on Biological Diversity \n CBD since The \n CBD \n definition of the Ecosystem Approach and a set of principles for its application were developed at an expert meeting in \n Malawi \n in known as the Malawi Principles \n The definition principles and points of \"operational guidance\" were adopted by the fifth Conference of Parties COP5 in The \n CBD \n definition is as follows \n The ecosystem approach is a strategy for the integrated management of land water and living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way Application of the ecosystem approach will help to reach a balance of the three objectives of the Convention An ecosystem approach is based on the application of appropriate scientific methodologies focused on levels of biological organization which encompasses the essential structures processes functions and interactions among organisms and their environment It recognizes that humans with their \n cultural diversity \n are an integral component of many ecosystems \n Sustainable forest management was recognized by parties to the \n Convention on Biological Diversity \n in Decision VII/11 of COP7 to be a concrete means of applying the Ecosystem Approach to forest ecosystems The two concepts sustainable forest management and the ecosystem approach aim at promoting conservation and management practices which are environmentally socially and economically sustainable and which generate and maintain benefits for both present and future generations In Europe the MCPFE and the Council for the Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy PEBLDS jointly recognized sustainable forest management to be consistent with the Ecosystem Approach in \n Independent certification \n Certified wood \n Growing \n environmental awareness \n and \n consumer demand \n for more socially responsible businesses helped third-party forest \n certification \n emerge in the 1990s as a credible tool for communicating the environmental and social performance of forest operations \n There are many potential users of certification including forest managers scientists policy makers investors environmental advocates business consumers of wood and paper and individuals \n With third-party \n forest certification \n an independent organization develops standards of good forest management and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards Forest certification verifies that forests are well-managed as defined by a particular standard and chain-of-custody certification tracks wood and paper products from the certified forest through processing to the point of sale \n This rise of certification led to the emergence of several different systems throughout the world As a result there is no single accepted forest management standard worldwide and each system takes a somewhat different approach in defining standards for sustainable forest management \n In its Forest Products Annual Market Review United Nations Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agriculture Organization stated \"Over the years many of the issues that previously divided the certification systems have become much less distinct The largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements \" \n Third-party forest certification is an important tool for those seeking to ensure that the paper and wood products they purchase and use come from forests that are well-managed and legally harvested Incorporating third-party certification into forest product procurement practices can be a centerpiece for comprehensive wood and paper policies that include factors such as the protection of sensitive forest values thoughtful material selection and efficient use of products \n There are more than fifty certification standards worldwide addressing the diversity of forest types and tenures Globally the two largest umbrella certification programs are \n Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification \n PEFC \n Forest Stewardship Council \n FSC \n The area of forest certified worldwide is growing slowly PEFC is the world's largest forest certification system with more than two-thirds of the total global certified area certified to its Sustainability Benchmarks \n In North America there are three certification standards endorsed by PEFC the Sustainable Forestry Initiative \n the Canadian Standards Association's Sustainable Forest Management Standard \n and the American Tree Farm System \n FSC has five standards in North America one in the United States \n and four in Canada \n While certification is intended as a tool to enhance forest management practices throughout the world to date most certified forestry operations are located in Europe and North America A significant barrier for many forest managers in \n developing countries \n is that they lack the capacity to undergo a certification audit and maintain operations to a certification standard \n Forest governance \n Countries participating in the UNREDD program and/or Forest Carbon Partnership Facility \n UN-REDD participants \n Forest Carbon Partnership Facility participants \n participants in both \n Although a majority of forests continue to be owned formally by government the effectiveness of forest governance is increasingly independent of formal ownership \n Since neo-liberal ideology in the 1980s and the emanation of the climate change challenges evidence that the state is failing to effectively manage environmental resources has emerged \n Under \n neo-liberal \n regimes in the developing countries the role of the state has diminished and the \n market forces \n have increasingly taken over the dominant socio-economic role \n Though the critiques of neo-liberal policies have maintained that market forces are not only inappropriate for sustaining the environment but are in fact a major cause of \n environmental destruction \n Hardin's tragedy of the common has shown that the people cannot be left to do as they wish with land or \n environmental resources \n Thus \n decentralization \n of management offers an alternative solution to forest governance \n The shifting of natural resource management responsibilities from central to state and local governments where this is occurring is usually a part of broader decentralization process \n According to Rondinelli and Cheema there are four distinct decentralization options these are i Privatization the transfer of authority from the central government to non-governmental sectors otherwise known as market-based service provision ii Delegation centrally nominated local authority iii \n Devolution \n transfer of power to locally acceptable authority and iv Deconcentration the redistribution of authority from the central government to field delegations of the central government The major key to effective decentralization is increased broad-based participation in local-public decision making In the World Bank report reveals that local government knows the needs and desires of their constituents better than the national government while at the same time it is easier to hold local leaders accountable From the study of West African tropical forest it is argued that the downwardly accountable and/or representative authorities with meaningful discretional powers are the basic institutional element of decentralization that should lead to efficiency development and equity \n This collaborates with the World Bank report in which says that decentralization should improve resource allocation efficiency accountability and equity \"by linking the cost and benefit of local services more closely\" \n Many reasons point to the advocacy of decentralization of forest i Integrated rural development projects often fail because they are top-down projects that did not take local people's needs and desires into account \n ii National government sometimes have legal authority over vast forest areas that they cannot control \n thus many protected area projects result in increased biodiversity loss and greater social conflict \n Within the sphere of forest management as state earlier the most effective option of decentralization is \"devolution\"-the transfer of power to locally accountable authority \n However apprehension about local governments is not unfounded They are often short of resources may be staffed by people with low education and are sometimes captured by local elites who promote clientelist relation rather than democratic participation \n Enters and Anderson point that the result of community-based projects intended to reverse the problems of past central approaches to conservation and development have also been discouraging \n Broadly speaking the goal of forest conservation has historically not been met when in contrast with \n land use \n changes driven by demand for food fuel and profit \n It is necessary to recognize and advocate for better forest governance more strongly given the importance of forest in meeting basic \n human needs \n in the future and maintaining ecosystem and biodiversity as well as addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation goal \n Such advocacy must be coupled with financial incentives for government of \n developing countries \n and greater governance role for local government civil society private sector and NGOs on behalf of the \"communities\" \n National Forest Funds \n The development of National Forest Funds is one way to address the issue of financing sustainable forest management \n National forest funds NFFs are dedicated financing mechanisms managed by public institutions designed to support the conservation and sustainable use of forest resources \n As of there are NFFs operating globally \n Forest genetic resources \n Appropriate use and long-term conservation of \n forest genetic resources \n FGR is a part of sustainable forest management \n In particular when it comes to the adaptation of \n forests \n and \n forest management \n to \n climate change \n Genetic diversity \n ensures that forest trees can survive adapt and evolve under changing environmental conditions Genetic diversity in forests also contributes to tree vitality and to the \n resilience \n towards pests and diseases Furthermore FGR has a crucial role in maintaining forest biological diversity at both species and \n ecosystem \n levels \n Selecting carefully the plant material with emphasis on getting a high genetic diversity rather than aiming at producing a uniform stand of trees is essential for sustainable use of FGR Considering the \n provenance \n is crucial as well For example in relation to climate change local material may not have the genetic diversity or \n phenotypic plasticity \n to guarantee good performance under changed conditions A different \n population \n from further away which may have experienced \n selection \n under conditions more like those forecast for the site to be \n reforested \n might represent a more suitable

Population Trust following a meeting on July by the late David Willey and others concerned about population numbers and sustainability They were impelled to act by the failure of United Kingdom governments to respond to a series of recommendations regarding \n population growth \n and sustainability \n The Optimum Population Trust prepared analyses and lobbied on issues affected by population growth It also lobbied developmental and environmental campaigners on the need to incorporate population issues in their thinking It was granted charitable status on May \n Population Matters was adopted as its campaign name in \n Views and aims \n Population Matters aims to achieve a future with decent living standards for all a healthy and biodiverse environment and a sustainable population size \n The charity holds the following policy positions \n Population \n Population growth increases damage to the environment and depletes natural resources Therefore human numbers should be reduced voluntarily to a sustainable level that enables an acceptable quality of life for all \n Given that human activity already exceeds Earths capacity to support it Population Matters argues that population stabilisation should be strived for without delay \n The United Nations projects that global population size could grow by billion between and which illustrates the urgency of the matter further according to the organisation \n Development and climate change \n Population growth increases the number of wealthy \n carbon emitters \n and poorer \n climate change \n victims and hampers mitigation and adaptation efforts In humanity used the sustainable resource output of Earths \n Evidence has been presented that less equal affluent countries consume more resources and generate more waste than other affluent countries \n Consequently Population Matters supports greater income equality \n Developed countries are responsible for the majority of \n resource consumption \n as well as the associated global environmental degradation Therefore the developed world has a responsibility to support developing nations according to the organisation \n Population Matters supports the concept of \n Contraction and Convergence \n as conceived by the Global Commons Institute \n Womens rights and reproductive health \n Womens empowerment \n and \n gender equality \n are essential for reproductive health economic development and population stabilisation Population Matters therefore support programmes to improve the status of women \n Population Matters embraces the \n Sustainable Development Goals \n that see womens empowerment as a necessary condition for sustainable development \n Comparisons made between developing nations that experienced rapid fertility decline and those that did not found that high fertility increases absolute levels of poverty by slowing economic growth and worsening the distribution of additionally acquired resources \n Consequently the organisation promotes policies improving access to contraceptive \n Migration \n Migration often results from conflict poverty inequality or population and consumption pressures Population Matters calls for fair trade terms and increased foreign aid and knowledge transfer to promote sustainable development global justice and resilience \n Population Matters believes that the only just and long-term solution to migration pressure is to address its underlying causes in the countries of origin such as poverty lack or over exploitation of resources climate change and conflict \n The organisation believes that developed countries have a moral responsibility to help with this because they contribute to migratory pressures by being both major consumers of resources from developing countries and are the principal source of the causes of climate change \n Ageing and parenthood \n Population Matters rejects the case that more young people are required to care for an increasing number of elderly It believes that governments should promote responsible parenthood and limit subsidies to the first two children unless a family is living in poverty \n Population Matters promotes the idea that society should deal with \n ageing \n by enabling employment for untrained underemployed and older people and by optimising the use of technology \n Activities \n Population Matters campaigns to stabilise population at a sustainable level through encouraging a culture shift towards smaller family sizes worldwide and improving resources for women's empowerment and family planning in lower income countries \n Over the years the organization has supported various campaigns including \n Caroline Lucas \n Bill to make Personal Social Health and Economic education \n PSHE \n a statutory requirement in state-funded schools \n It also produces material to help its supporters raise awareness of population growth \n The charity also runs \n PopOffsets \n a project that offers members of the public the opportunity to offset their carbon emissions by donating towards family planning projects around the world \n Other activities include the Population Matters Overshoot Index which presents assessments of the extent to which countries and regions of the world are considered to be able to support themselves on the basis of their own renewable resources It also produces short films such as Zombie Overpopulation \n Organisational structure \n Population Matters consists of patrons an advisory council a board and a team of staff and volunteers and members It relies on members and donors for its funding \n Patrons \n Population Matters' patrons include prominent and successful public figures such as the broadcaster \n Sir David Attenborough \n the economist Sir \n Partha Dasgupta \n the biologist Professor \n Paul Ehrlich \n the primatologist Dr \n Jane Goodall \n Professor \n John Guillebaud \n and the politician Baroness \n Shreela Flather \n Local groups \n Population Matters encourages its members to create and run local groups in their communities There are currently nine of these groups that are recognised by the organisation in the UK Most of them meet regularly at local venues to discuss population and sustainability issues with like-minded people \n Criticism \n In Population Matters was criticised for calling for zero-net

subsidies cap and trade CAT schemes are a type of \n flexible environmental regulation \n that allows organizations to decide how best to meet policy targets Various countries states and groups of companies have adopted such trading systems notably for mitigating \n climate change \n A central authority usually a \n governmental \n body allocates or sells a limited number of permits to discharge specific quantities of a specific pollutant per time period \n Polluters are required to hold permits in amount equal to their emissions Polluters that want to increase their emissions must buy permits from others willing to sell them \n Financial derivatives \n of permits can also be traded on secondary markets \n In theory polluters who can reduce emissions most cheaply will do so achieving the emission reduction at the lowest cost to society \n Cap and trade is meant to provide the private sector with the flexibility required to reduce emissions while stimulating technological

than other options \n Pollution \n is the prime example of a market externality An \n externality \n is an effect of some activity on an entity such as a person that is not party to a market transaction related to that activity Emissions trading is a market-based approach among others to address pollution The overall goal of an emissions trading plan is to minimize the cost of meeting a set emissions target \n In an emissions trading system the government sets an overall limit on emissions and defines permits also called allowances or limited authorizations to emit up to the level of the overall limit The government may sell the permits but in many existing schemes it gives permits to participants regulated polluters equal to each participant's baseline emissions The baseline is determined by reference to the participant's historical emissions To demonstrate compliance a participant must hold permits at least equal to the quantity of pollution it actually emitted during the time period If every participant complies the total pollution emitted will be at most equal to the sum of individual limits \n Because permits can be bought and sold a participant can choose either to use its permits exactly by reducing its own emissions or to emit less than its permits and perhaps sell the excess permits or to emit more than its permits and buy permits from other participants In effect the buyer pays a charge for polluting while the seller gains a reward for having reduced emissions \n In many schemes organizations which do not pollute and therefore have no obligations may also trade permits and financial derivatives of permits In some schemes participants can bank allowances to use in future periods \n In some schemes a proportion of all traded permits must be retired periodically causing a net reduction in emissions over time Thus \n environmental groups \n may buy and retire permits driving up the price of the remaining permits according to the \n law of demand \n In most schemes permit owners can donate permits to a nonprofit entity and receive a tax deduction Usually the government lowers the overall limit over time with an aim towards a national emissions reduction target \n According to the Environmental Defense Fund cap-and-trade is the most environmentally and economically sensible approach to controlling greenhouse gas emissions the primary cause of global warming because it sets a limit on emissions and the trading encourages companies to innovate in order to emit less \n \"International trade can offer a range of positive and negative incentives to promote international cooperation on climate change robust evidence medium agreement Three issues are key to developing constructive relationships between international trade and climate agreements how existing trade policies and rules can be modified to be more climate friendly whether border adjustment measures BAMs or other trade measures can be effective in meeting the goals of international climate agreements whether the UNFCCC World Trade Organization WTO hybrid of the two or a new institution is the best forum for a trade-and-climate architecture \" \n Market and least-cost \n Economy-wide pricing of carbon is the centre piece of any policy designed to reduce emissions at the lowest possible costs \n Ross Garnaut \n lead author of the \n Garnaut Climate Change Review \n Many economists have urged the use of market-based instruments such as emissions trading to address environmental problems instead of prescriptive \"command-and-control\" regulation \n Command and control regulation \n is criticized for being insensitive to geographical and technological differences and therefore inefficient \n After an emissions limit has been set by a government political process individual companies are free to choose how or whether to reduce their emissions Failure to report emissions and surrender emission permits is often punishable by a further government regulatory mechanism such as a fine that increases costs of production Firms will choose the least-cost way to comply with the pollution regulation which will lead to reductions where the least expensive solutions exist while allowing emissions that are more expensive to reduce \n Under an emissions trading system each regulated polluter has flexibility to use the most cost-effective combination of buying or selling emission permits reducing its emissions by installing cleaner technology or reducing its emissions by reducing production The most cost-effective strategy depends on the polluter's marginal abatement cost and the market price of permits In theory a polluter's decisions should lead to an economically efficient allocation of reductions among polluters and lower compliance costs for individual firms and for the economy overall compared to command-and-control mechanisms \n Emission markets \n For emissions trading where greenhouse gases are regulated one emissions permit is considered equivalent to one \n metric ton \n of \n carbon dioxide \n CO \n emissions Other names for emissions permits are \n carbon credits \n Kyoto units \n assigned amount units \n and \n Certified Emission Reduction \n units CER These permits can be sold privately or in the international market at the prevailing market price These trade and \n settle \n internationally and hence allow permits to be transferred between countries Each international transfer is validated by the \n United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \n UNFCCC Each transfer of ownership within the \n European Union \n is additionally validated by the \n European Commission \n Emissions trading programmes such as the European Union Emissions Trading System EU ETS complement the country-to-country trading stipulated in the Kyoto Protocol by allowing private trading of permits Under such programmes which are generally co-ordinated with the national emissions targets provided within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol a national or international authority allocates permits to individual companies based on established criteria with a view to meeting national and/or regional Kyoto targets at the lowest overall economic cost \n Trading exchanges have been established to provide a \n spot market \n in permits as well as \n futures \n and \n options \n market \n to help discover a market price and maintain \n liquidity \n Carbon prices are normally quoted in \n euros \n per tonne of carbon dioxide or its equivalent CO \n e Other greenhouse gases can also be traded but are quoted as standard multiples of carbon dioxide with respect to their \n global warming potential \n These features reduce the quota's financial impact on business while ensuring that the quotas are met at a national and international level \n Currently there are six exchanges trading in UNFCCC related \n carbon credits \n the \n Chicago Climate Exchange \n until \n European Climate Exchange \n NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe \n PowerNext \n Commodity Exchange Bratislava \n and the \n European Energy Exchange \n NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe listed a contract to trade offsets generated by a CDM \n carbon project \n called Certified Emission Reductions Many companies now engage in emissions abatement offsetting and sequestration programs to generate credits that can be sold on one of the exchanges At least one \n private electronic market \n has been established in CantorCO2e \n Carbon credits at Commodity Exchange Bratislava are traded at special platform called Carbon place \n Trading in emission permits is one of the fastest-growing segments in financial services in the \n City of London \n with a market estimated to be worth about billion in Louis Redshaw head of environmental markets at \n Barclays Capital \n predicts that \"carbon will be the world's biggest commodity market and it could become the world's biggest market overall \" \n Pollution markets \n An emission license directly confers a right to emit pollutants up to a certain rate In contrast a \n pollution license \n for a given location confers the right to emit pollutants at a rate which will cause no more than a specified increase at the pollution-level For concreteness consider the following model \n There are \n n \n { displaystyle n} \n agents each of which emits \n e \n i \n { displaystyle e {i}} \n pollutants \n There are \n m \n { displaystyle m} \n locations each of which suffers pollution \n q \n i \n { displaystyle q {i}} \n The pollution is a linear combination of the emissions The relation between \n e \n { displaystyle e} \n and \n q \n { displaystyle q} \n is given by a \n diffusion matrix \n H \n { displaystyle H} \n such that \n q \n = \n H \n e \n { displaystyle q=H cdot e} \n As an example consider three countries along a river as in the \n fair river sharing \n setting \n Pollution in the upstream country is determined only by the emission of the upstream country \n q \n = \n e \n { displaystyle q {1}=e {1}} \n Pollution in the middle country is determined by its own emission and by the emission of country \n q \n = \n e \n + \n e \n { displaystyle q {2}=e {1}+e {2}} \n Pollution in the downstream country is the sum of all emissions \n q \n = \n e \n + \n e \n + \n e \n { displaystyle q {3}=e {1}+e {2}+e {3}} \n So the matrix \n H \n { displaystyle H} \n in this case is a triangular matrix of ones \n Each pollution-license for location \n i \n { displaystyle i} \n permits its holder to emit pollutants that will cause at most this level of pollution at location \n i \n { displaystyle i} \n Therefore a polluter that affects water quality at a number of points has to hold a portfolio of licenses covering all relevant monitoring-points In the above example if country wants to emit a unit of pollutant it should purchase two permits one for location and one for location \n Montgomery shows that while both markets lead to efficient license allocation the market in pollution-licenses is more widely applicable than the market in emission-licenses \n The international community began the long process towards building effective international and domestic measures to tackle GHG emissions carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydroflurocarbons perfluorocarbons sulphur hexafluoride in response to the increasing assertions that global warming is happening due to man-made emissions and the uncertainty over its likely consequences That process began in Rio in when countries agreed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC The UNFCCC is as its title suggests simply a framework the necessary detail was left to be settled by the Conference of Parties CoP to the UNFCCC \n The efficiency of what later was to be called the \"cap-and-trade\" approach to \n air pollution \n abatement was first demonstrated in a series of micro-economic computer simulation studies between and for the National Air Pollution Control Administration predecessor to the \n United States Environmental Protection Agency \n 's Office of Air and Radiation by Ellison Burton and William Sanjour These studies used mathematical models of several cities and their emission sources in order to compare the cost and effectiveness of various control strategies \n Each abatement strategy was compared with the \"least-cost solution\" produced by a computer optimization program to identify the least-costly combination of source reductions in order to achieve a given abatement goal In each case it was found that the least-cost solution was dramatically less costly than the same amount of pollution reduction produced by any conventional abatement strategy \n Burton and later Sanjour along with Edward H Pechan continued improving \n and advancing \n these computer models at the newly created U S Environmental Protection Agency The agency introduced the concept of computer modeling with least-cost abatement strategies i e emissions trading in its annual report to Congress on the cost of clean air \n This led to the concept of \"cap and trade\" as a means of achieving the \"least-cost solution\" for a given level of abatement \n The development of emissions trading over the course of its history can be divided into four phases \n Gestation Theoretical articulation of the instrument by \n Coase \n Crocker \n Dales \n Montgomery \n etc and independent of the former tinkering with \"flexible regulation\" at the US Environmental Protection Agency \n Proof of Principle First developments towards trading of emission certificates based on the \"offset-mechanism\" taken up in Clean Air Act in A company could get allowance from the Act on a greater amount of emission when it paid another company to reduce the same pollutant \n Prototype Launching of a first \"cap-and-trade\" system as part of the US \n Acid Rain Program \n in Title IV of the \n Clean Air Act \n officially announced as a paradigm shift in environmental policy as prepared by \"Project 88\" a network-building effort to bring together environmental and industrial interests in the US \n Regime formation branching out from the \n US clean air policy \n to \n global climate policy \n and from there to the European Union along with the expectation of an emerging global \n carbon \n market and the formation of the \"carbon industry\" \n In the United States the \" \n acid rain \n \"-related emission trading system was principally conceived by \n C Boyden Gray \n a \n G H W Bush \n administration attorney Gray worked with the \n Environmental Defense Fund \n EDF who worked with the EPA to write the bill that became law as part of the Clean Air Act of The new emissions cap on NO \n x \n and \n SO \n gases took effect in and according to \n Smithsonian \n magazine those acid rain emissions dropped million tons that year \n In the CoP agreed in what has been described as a watershed in international environmental treaty making the Kyoto Protocol where developed countries Annex countries committed themselves to targets and timetables for the reduction of GHGs \n These targets for developed countries are often referred to as Assigned Amounts \n One important economic reality recognised by many of the countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol is that if countries have to solely rely on their own domestic measures the resulting inflexible limitations on GHG growth could entail very large costs perhaps running into many trillions of dollars globally \n As a result international mechanisms which would allow developed countries flexibility to meet their targets were included in the Kyoto Protocol The purpose of these mechanisms is to allow the parties to find the most economic ways to achieve their targets These international mechanisms are outlined under Kyoto Protocol \n On April the Environmental Protection Agency EPA formally announced that it had found that greenhouse gas GHG poses a threat to public health and the environment EPA 2009a This announcement was significant because it gives the executive branch the authority to impose carbon regulations on carbon-emitting entities \n A carbon cap-and-trade system is to be introduced nationwide in China in \n China's National Development and Reform Commission proposed that an absolute cap be placed on emission by \n Public opinion \n In the United States most polling shows large support for emissions trading often referred to as cap-and-trade This majority support can be seen in polls conducted by \n Washington Post \n / \n ABC News \n Zogby International \n and \n Yale University \n A new Washington Post-ABC poll reveals that majorities of the American people believe in climate change are concerned about it are willing to change their lifestyles and pay more to address it and want the federal government to regulate greenhouse gases They are however ambivalent on cap-and-trade \n More than three-quarters of respondents 0% reported they strongly support 0% or somewhat support 0% the EPAs decision to regulate carbon emissions While 6% of respondents reported being very willing 0% or somewhat willing 6% another 8% reported being somewhat unwilling 8% or not at all willing 0% to pay higher prices for Green energy sources to support funding for programs that reduce the effect of global warming \n According to \n PolitiFact \n it is a misconception that emissions trading is unpopular in the United States because of earlier polls from \n Zogby International \n and \n Rasmussen \n which misleadingly include \"new taxes\" in the questions taxes aren't part of emissions trading or high energy cost estimates \n Comparison with other methods of emission reduction \n Cap and trade is the textbook emissions trading program Other market-based approaches include baseline-and-credit and pollution tax They all put a price on pollution for example see \n carbon price \n and so provide an economic incentive to reduce pollution beginning with the lowest-cost opportunities By contrast in a command-and-control approach a central authority designates pollution levels each facility is allowed to emit \n Baseline and credit \n In a baseline and credit program polluters can create permits called credits or offsets by reducing their emissions below a baseline level which is often the historical emissions level from a designated past year \n Such credits can be bought by polluters that have a regulatory limit \n Pollution tax \n Emissions fees or environmental tax is a surcharge on the pollution created while producing goods and services \n For example a carbon tax is a tax on the carbon content of fossil fuels that aims to discourage their use and thereby reduce carbon dioxide emissions \n The two approaches are overlapping sets of policy designs Both can have a range of scopes points of regulation and price schedules They can be fair or unfair depending on how the revenue is used Both have the effect of increasing the price of goods such as fossil fuels to consumers \n A comprehensive upstream auctioned cap-and-trade system is very similar to a comprehensive upstream carbon tax Yet many commentators sharply contrast the two approaches \n The main difference is what is defined and what derived A tax is a price control while cap-and-trade method acts is a quantity control instrument \n That is a tax is a unit price for pollution that is set by authorities and the market determines the quantity emitted in cap and trade authorities determine the amount of pollution and the market determines the price \n This difference affects a number of criteria \n Responsiveness to inflation \n Cap-and-trade has the advantage that it adjusts to \n inflation \n changes to overall prices automatically while emissions fees must be changed by regulators \n Responsiveness to cost changes \n It is not clear which approach is better It is possible to combine the two into a safety valve price a price set by regulators at which polluters can buy additional permits beyond the cap \n Responsiveness to recessions \n This point is closely related to responsiveness to cost changes because recessions cause a drop in demand Under cap and trade the emissions cost automatically decreases so a cap-and-trade scheme adds another \n automatic stabilizer \n to the economy - in effect an automatic fiscal stimulus However a lower pollution price also results in reduced efforts to reduce pollution If the government is able to stimulate the economy regardless of the cap-and-trade scheme an excessively low price causes a missed opportunity to cut emissions faster than planned Instead it might be better to have a price floor a tax This is especially true when cutting pollution is urgent as with greenhouse gas emissions A price floor also provides certainty and stability for investment in emissions reductions recent experience from the UK shows that nuclear power operators are reluctant to invest on \"un-subsidised\" terms unless there is a guaranteed price floor for carbon which the EU emissions trading scheme does not presently provide \n Responsiveness to uncertainty \n As with cost changes in a world of uncertainty it is not clear whether emissions fees or cap-and-trade systems are more efficientit depends on how fast the marginal social benefits of reducing pollution fall with the amount of cleanup e g whether inelastic or elastic marginal social benefit schedule \n Other \n The magnitude of the tax will depend on how sensitive the supply of emissions is to the price The permit price of cap-and-trade will depend on the pollutant market A tax generates government revenue but full-auctioned emissions permits can do the same A similar upstream cap-and-trade system could be implemented An upstream carbon tax might be the simplest to administer Setting up a complex cap-and-trade arrangement that is comprehensive has high institutional needs \n Command-and-control regulation \n Command and control is a system of regulation that prescribes emission limits and compliance methods for each facility or source It is the traditional approach to reducing air pollution \n Command-and-control regulations are more rigid than incentive-based approaches such as pollution fees and cap and trade An example of this is a performance standard which sets an emissions goal for each polluter that is fixed and therefore the burden of reducing pollution cannot be shifted to the firms that can achieve it more cheaply As a result performance standards are likely to be more costly overall \n The additional costs would be passed to end consumers \n Setting firmer limits on emissions and mandating that all goods sold in-country be produced according to the same emission standards and partially subsidizing costs would meet emissions targets without an excessive increase in cost to consumers and would naturally increase funding to and competition in the pollution abatement industry driving innovation in lower-cost and more efficient emission reduction methods and systems \n Economics of international

e \n It is possible for a country to reduce emissions using a \n Command-Control \n approach such as regulation \n direct \n and \n indirect taxes \n The cost of that approach differs between countries because the \n Marginal Abatement Cost Curve \n MAC the cost of eliminating an additional unit of pollution differs by country It might cost China $2 to eliminate a ton of \n CO \n but it would probably cost Norway or the U S much more International emissions-trading markets were created precisely to exploit differing MACs \n Example \n Emissions trading through \n Gains from Trade \n can be more beneficial for both the buyer and the seller than a simple emissions capping scheme \n Consider two European countries such as Germany and Sweden Each can either reduce all the required amount of emissions by itself or it can choose to buy or sell in the market \n Example MACs for two different countries \n Suppose Germany can abate its CO \n at a much cheaper cost than Sweden i e MAC \n S \n > MAC \n G \n where the MAC curve of Sweden is steeper higher slope than that of Germany and R \n Req \n is the total amount of emissions that need to be reduced by a country \n On the left side of the graph is the MAC curve for Germany R \n Req \n is the amount of required reductions for Germany but at R \n Req \n the MAC \n G \n curve has not intersected the market emissions permit price of CO \n market permit price = P = Thus given the market price of CO \n allowances Germany has potential to profit if it abates more emissions than required \n On the right side is the MAC curve for Sweden R \n Req \n is the amount of required reductions for Sweden but the MAC \n S \n curve already intersects the market price of CO \n permits before R \n Req \n has been reached Thus given the market price of CO \n permits Sweden has potential to make a cost saving if it abates fewer emissions than required internally and instead abates them elsewhere \n In this example Sweden would abate emissions until its MAC \n S \n intersects with P at R* but this would only reduce a fraction of Sweden's total required abatement \n After that it could buy emissions credits from Germany for the price \n P \n per unit The internal cost of Sweden's own abatement combined with the permits it buys in the market from Germany adds up to the total required reductions R \n Req \n for Sweden Thus Sweden can make a saving from buying permits in the market d-e-f This represents the \"Gains from Trade\" the amount of additional expense that Sweden would otherwise have to spend if it abated all of its required emissions by itself without trading \n Germany made a profit on its additional emissions abatement above what was required it met the regulations by abating all of the emissions that was required of it R \n Req \n Additionally Germany sold its surplus permits to Sweden and was paid \n P \n for every unit it abated while spending less than \n P \n Its total revenue is the area of the graph R \n Req \n R* its total abatement cost is area R \n Req \n R* and so its net benefit from selling emission permits is the area 1-2-3 i e Gains from Trade \n The two R* on both graphs represent the efficient allocations that arise from trading \n Germany sold R* - R \n Req \n emission permits to Sweden at a unit price \n P \n Sweden bought emission permits from Germany at a unit price \n P \n If the total cost for reducing a particular amount of emissions in the \n Command Control \n scenario is called \n X \n then to reduce the same amount of combined pollution in Sweden and Germany the total abatement cost would be less in the \n Emissions Trading \n scenario i e X - def \n The example above applies not just at the national level but also between two companies in different countries or between two subsidiaries within the same company \n Applying the economic theory \n The nature of the pollutant plays a very important role when policy-makers decide which framework should be used to control pollution CO \n acts globally thus its impact on the environment is generally similar wherever in the globe it is released So the location of the originator of the emissions does not matter from an environmental standpoint \n The policy framework should be different for regional pollutants \n e g \n SO \n and \n NO \n x \n and also \n mercury \n because the impact of these pollutants may differ by location The same amount of a regional pollutant can exert a very high impact in some locations and a low impact in other locations so it matters where the pollutant is released This is known as the \n Hot Spot \n problem \n A \n Lagrange framework \n is commonly used to determine the least cost of achieving an objective in this case the total reduction in emissions required in a year In some cases it is possible to use the Lagrange optimization framework to determine the required reductions for each country based on their MAC so that the total cost of reduction is minimized In such a scenario the \n Lagrange multiplier \n represents the market allowance price P of a pollutant such as the current market price of emission permits in Europe and the USA \n Countries face the permit market price that exists in the market that day so they are able to make individual decisions that would minimize their costs while at the same time achieving regulatory compliance This is also another version of the \n Equi-Marginal Principle \n commonly used in economics to choose the most economically efficient decision \n Prices versus quantities and the safety valve \n There has been longstanding debate on the relative merits of \n price \n versus \n quantity \n instruments to achieve emission reductions \n An emission cap and permit trading system is a \n quantity \n instrument because it fixes the overall emission level quantity and allows the price to vary Uncertainty in future supply and demand conditions market volatility coupled with a fixed number of pollution permits creates an uncertainty in the future price of pollution permits and the industry must accordingly bear the cost of adapting to these volatile market conditions The burden of a volatile market thus lies with the industry rather than the controlling agency which is generally more efficient However under volatile market conditions the ability of the controlling agency to alter the caps will translate into an ability to pick \"winners and losers\" and thus presents an opportunity for corruption \n In contrast an \n emission tax \n is a \n price \n instrument because it fixes the price while the emission level is allowed to vary according to economic activity A major drawback of an emission tax is that the environmental outcome e g a limit on the amount of emissions is not guaranteed On one hand a tax will remove capital from the industry suppressing possibly useful economic activity but conversely the polluter will not need to hedge as much against future uncertainty since the amount of tax will track with profits The burden of a volatile market will be borne by the controlling taxing agency rather than the industry itself which is generally less efficient An advantage is that given a uniform tax rate and a volatile market the taxing entity will not be in a position to pick \"winners and losers\" and the opportunity for corruption will be less \n Assuming no corruption and assuming that the controlling agency and the industry are equally efficient at adapting to volatile market conditions the best choice depends on the sensitivity of the costs of emission reduction compared to the sensitivity of the benefits i e climate damage avoided by a reduction when the level of emission control is varied \n Because there is high uncertainty in the compliance costs of firms some argue that the optimum choice is the price mechanism However the burden of uncertainty cannot be eliminated and in this case it is shifted to the taxing agency itself \n The overwhelming majority of climate scientists have repeatedly warned of a threshold in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide beyond which a run-away \n warming \n effect could take place with a large possibility of causing irreversible damage With such a risk a quantity instrument may be a better choice because the quantity of emissions may be capped with more certainty However this may not be true if this risk exists but cannot be attached to a known level of greenhouse gas GHG concentration or a known emission pathway \n A third option known as a \n safety valve \n is a hybrid of the price and quantity instruments The system is essentially an emission cap and permit trading system but the maximum or minimum permit price is capped Emitters have the choice of either obtaining permits in the marketplace or buying them from the government at a specified trigger price which could be adjusted over time The system is sometimes recommended as a way of overcoming the fundamental disadvantages of both systems by giving governments the flexibility to adjust the system as new information comes to light It can be shown that by setting the trigger price high enough or the number of permits low enough the safety valve can be used to mimic either a pure quantity or pure price mechanism \n All three methods are being used as policy instruments to control greenhouse gas emissions the EU-ETS is a \n quantity \n system using the cap and trading system to meet targets set by \n National Allocation Plans \n Denmark has a price system using a \n carbon tax \n World Bank p \n while China uses the CO \n market price for funding of its \n Clean Development Mechanism \n projects but imposes a \n safety valve \n of a minimum price per tonne of CO \n Carbon leakage \n Carbon leakage \n is the effect that regulation of emissions in one country/sector has on the emissions in other countries/sectors that are not subject to the same regulation \n There is no consensus over the magnitude of long-term carbon leakage \n In the Kyoto Protocol Annex I countries are subject to caps on emissions but non-Annex I countries are not Barker \n et al \n assessed the literature on leakage The leakage rate is defined as the increase in CO \n emissions outside the countries taking domestic mitigation action divided by the reduction in emissions of countries taking domestic mitigation action Accordingly a leakage rate greater than 100% means that actions to reduce emissions within countries had the effect of increasing emissions in other countries to a greater extent i e domestic mitigation action had actually led to an increase in global emissions \n Estimates of leakage rates for action under the Kyoto Protocol ranged from 5% to 20% as a result of a loss in price competitiveness but these leakage rates were considered very uncertain \n For energy-intensive industries the beneficial effects of Annex I actions through technological development were considered possibly substantial However this beneficial effect had not been reliably quantified On the empirical evidence they assessed Barker \n et al \n concluded that the competitive losses of then-current mitigation actions e g the EU ETS were not significant \n Under the EU ETS rules \n Carbon Leakage Exposure Factor \n is used to determine the volumes of free allocation of emission permits to industrial installations \n Trade \n To understand carbon trading it is important to understand the products that are being traded The primary product in carbon markets is the trading of GHG emission permits Under a cap-and-trade system permits are issued to various entities for the right to emit GHG emissions that meet emission reduction requirement caps \n One of the controversies about carbon mitigation policy is how to \"level the playing field\" with border adjustments \n For example one component of the \n American Clean Energy and Security Act \n along with several other energy bills put before US Congress calls for carbon surcharges on goods imported from countries without cap-and-trade programs Besides issues of compliance with the \n General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n such border adjustments presume that the producing countries bear responsibility for the carbon emissions \n A general perception among developing countries is that discussion of climate change in trade negotiations could lead to \"green \n protectionism \n \" by high-income countries World Bank p \n Tariffs on imports \"virtual carbon\" consistent with a carbon price of $50 per ton of CO \n could be significant for developing countries World Bank commented that introducing border tariffs could lead to a proliferation of trade measures where the competitive playing field is viewed as being uneven Tariffs could also be a burden on low-income countries that have contributed very little to the problem of climate change \n Trading systems \n Kyoto Protocol \n As the \n Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n IPCC reports came in over the years they shed abundant light on the true state of global warming and they gave support to the environmental effort to address this unprecedented problem However the same discussions that started decades back had never ceased and the crusade for a tangible solution to global climate change had gone on all the while In the Kyoto Protocol was adopted The \n Kyoto Protocol \n is a international treaty that came into force in In the treaty most developed nations agreed to legally binding targets for their emissions of the six major \n greenhouse gases \n Emission quotas known as \"Assigned amounts\" were agreed by each participating 'Annex I' country with the intention of reducing the overall emissions by 2% from their levels by the end of The United States is the only industrialized nation under \n Annex I \n that has not ratified the treaty and is therefore not bound by it The IPCC has projected that the financial effect of compliance through trading within the Kyoto commitment period will be limited at between 1-1 1% of \n GDP \n among trading countries \n The agreement was intended to result in industrialized countries' emissions declining in aggregate by percent below levels by the year of Despite the failure of the United States and Australia to ratify the protocol the agreement became effective in once the requirement that Annex I predominantly industrialized countries jointly accounting for percent of Annex I emissions ratify the agreement was met \n The Protocol defines several mechanisms \" \n flexible mechanisms \n \" that are designed to allow Annex I countries to meet their emission reduction commitments caps with reduced economic impact \n Under Article of the Kyoto Protocol Annex I Parties may use GHG removals from afforestation and reforestation forest sinks and deforestation sources since to meet their emission reduction commitments \n Annex I Parties may also use International Emissions Trading IET Under the treaty for the 5-year compliance period from until \n nations that emit less than their quota will be able to sell \n assigned amount units \n each AAU representing an allowance to emit one metric tonne of CO \n to nations that exceed their quotas \n It is also possible for Annex I countries to sponsor \n carbon projects \n that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other countries These projects generate tradable \n carbon credits \n that can be used by Annex I countries in meeting their caps The project-based Kyoto Mechanisms are the \n Clean Development Mechanism \n CDM and \n Joint Implementation \n JI There are four such international flexible mechanisms or Kyoto Mechanism \n written in the Kyoto Protocol \n Article if the Protocol authorizes Annex countries that have agreed to the emissions limitations to take part in emissions trading with other Annex Countries \n Article authorizes such parties to implement their limitations jointly as the member states of the EU have chosen to do \n Article provides that such Annex countries may take part in joint initiatives JIs in return for emissions reduction units ERUs to be used against their Assigned Amounts \n Art provides for a mechanism known as the clean development mechanism CDM \n under which Annex countries may invest in emissions limitation projects in developing countries and use certified emissions reductions CERs generated against their own Assigned Amounts \n The CDM covers projects taking place in non-Annex I countries while JI covers projects taking place in Annex I countries CDM projects are supposed to contribute to \n sustainable development \n in developing countries and also generate \"real\" and \"additional\" emission savings i e savings that only occur thanks to the CDM project in question Carbon Trust p \n Whether or not these emission savings are genuine is however difficult to prove World Bank pp \n Australia \n Main articles \n Garnaut Climate Change Review \n Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme \n and \n Clean Energy Bill \n In the New South Wales NSW state government unilaterally established the NSW Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme \n to reduce emissions by requiring electricity generators and large consumers to purchase NSW Greenhouse Abatement Certificates NGACs This has prompted the rollout of free energy-efficient compact fluorescent lightbulbs and other energy-efficiency measures funded by the credits This scheme has been criticised by the Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets CEEM of the \n UNSW \n because of its lack of effectiveness in reducing emissions its lack of transparency and its lack of verification of the additionality of emission reductions \n Both the incumbent \n Howard \n Coalition \n government and the \n Rudd \n Labor \n opposition promised to implement an emissions trading scheme ETS before the \n federal election \n Labor won the election with the new government proceeding to implement an ETS The government introduced the \n Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme \n which the \n Liberals \n supported with \n Malcolm Turnbull \n as leader \n Tony Abbott \n questioned an ETS saying the best way to reduce emissions is with a \"simple tax\" \n Shortly before the carbon vote Abbott defeated Turnbull in a leadership challenge and from there on the Liberals opposed the ETS This left the government unable to secure passage of the bill and it was subsequently withdrawn \n Julia Gillard \n defeated Rudd in a leadership challenge and promised not to introduce a carbon tax but would look to legislate a price on carbon \n when taking the government to the \n election \n In the first \n hung parliament \n result in years the government required the support of crossbenchers including the \n Greens \n One requirement for Greens support was a carbon price which Gillard proceeded with in forming a minority government A fixed carbon price would proceed to a floating-price ETS within a few years under the plan The fixed price lent itself to characterisation as a carbon tax and when the government proposed the \n Clean Energy Bill \n in February \n the opposition claimed it to be a broken election promise \n The bill was passed by the \n Lower House \n in October \n and the \n Upper House \n in November \n The Liberal Party vowed to overturn the bill if elected \n The bill thus resulted in passage of the Clean Energy Act which possessed a great deal of flexibility in its design and uncertainty over its future \n The \n Liberal/National coalition \n government elected in September has promised to reverse the climate legislation of the previous government \n In July the carbon tax was repealed as well as the Emissions Trading Scheme ETS that was to start in \n New Zealand \n New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme \n and \n Climate change in New Zealand \n New Zealand Unit Prices to \n The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme NZ ETS is a partial-coverage all-free allocation uncapped highly internationally linked emissions trading scheme The NZ ETS was first legislated in the \n Climate Change Response Emissions Trading Amendment Act \n in September under the \n Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand \n and then amended in November \n and in November \n by the \n Fifth National Government of New Zealand \n The NZ ETS covers forestry a net sink energy 4% of total emissions industry 7% of total emissions and waste 8% of total emissions but not pastoral agriculture 47% of total emissions \n Participants in the NZ ETS must surrender two emissions units either an international 'Kyoto' unit or a New Zealand-issued unit for every three tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions reported or they may choose to buy NZ units from the government at a fixed price of NZ$25 \n Individual sectors of the economy have different entry dates when their obligations to report emissions and surrender emission units take effect Forestry which contributed net removals of \n Mts \n of \n CO \n e \n in 19% of NZ's emissions \n entered the NZ ETS on January \n The stationary energy industrial processes and liquid fossil fuel sectors entered the NZ ETS on July The waste sector landfill operators entered on January \n Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from pastoral agriculture are not included in the NZ ETS From November agriculture was to enter the NZ ETS on January \n The NZ ETS is highly linked to international carbon markets as it allows the importing of most of the \n Kyoto Protocol \n emission units However as of June the scheme will effectively transition into a domestic scheme with restricted access to international Kyoto units CERs ERUs and RMUs \n The NZ ETS has a domestic unit the 'New Zealand Unit' NZU which is issued by free allocation to emitters with no auctions intended in the short term \n Free allocation of NZUs varies between sectors The commercial fishery sector who are not participants have a free allocation of units on a historic basis \n Owners of pre-1990 forests have received a fixed free allocation of units \n Free allocation to emissions-intensive industry \n is provided on an output-intensity basis For this sector there is no set limit on the number of units that may be allocated \n The number of units allocated to eligible emitters is based on the average emissions per unit of output within a defined 'activity' \n Bertram and Terry p state that as the NZ ETS does not 'cap' emissions the NZ ETS is not a cap and trade scheme as understood in the economics literature \n Some stakeholders have criticized the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme for its generous free allocations of emission units and the lack of a carbon price signal the \n Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment \n and for being ineffective in reducing emissions \n Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand \n The NZ ETS was reviewed in late by an independent panel which reported to the Government and public in September \n European Union \n European Union Emission Trading Scheme \n The European Union Emission Trading Scheme or EU ETS is the largest multi-national greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world It is one of the EU's central policy instruments to meet their cap set in the Kyoto Protocol \n After voluntary \n trials in the UK \n and Denmark Phase I began operation in January with all member states of the \n European Union \n participating \n The program caps the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted from large installations with a net heat supply in excess of MW such as power plants and carbon intensive factories \n and covers almost half 46% of the EU's Carbon Dioxide emissions \n Phase I permits participants to trade among themselves and in validated credits from the developing world through Kyoto's \n Clean Development Mechanism \n Credits are gained by investing in clean technologies and low-carbon solutions and by certain types of emission-saving projects around the world to cover a proportion of their emissions \n During Phases I and II allowances for emissions have typically been given free to firms which has resulted in them getting windfall profits \n Ellerman and Buchner suggested that during its first two years in operation the \n EU ETS \n turned an expected increase in emissions of 1%-2% per year into a small absolute decline Grubb \n et al \n suggested that a reasonable estimate for the emissions cut achieved during its first two years of operation was 50-100 MtCO \n per year or 5%-5% \n A number of design flaws have limited the effectiveness of the scheme \n In the initial 2005-07 period emission caps were not tight enough to drive a significant reduction in emissions \n The total allocation of allowances turned out to exceed actual emissions This drove the carbon price down to zero in This oversupply was caused because the allocation of allowances by the EU was based on emissions data from the European Environmental Agency in Copenhagen which uses a horizontal activity-based emissions definition similar to the United Nations the EU ETS Transaction log in Brussels but a vertical installation-based emissions measurement system This caused an oversupply of million tonnes 10% of market in the EU ETS in the first phase and collapsing prices \n Phase II saw some tightening but the use of JI and CDM offsets was allowed with the result that no reductions in the EU will be required to meet the Phase II cap \n For Phase II the cap is expected to result in an emissions reduction in of about 4% compared to expected emissions without the cap business-as-usual emissions \n For Phase III the \n European Commission \n proposed a number of changes including \n Setting an overall EU cap with allowances then allocated to EU members \n Tighter limits on the use of offsets \n Unlimited banking of allowances between Phases II and III \n A move from allowances to auctioning \n In January Norway Iceland and Liechtenstein joined the European Union Emissions Trading System \n EU ETS \n according to a publication from the \n European Commission \n The \n Norwegian Ministry of the Environment \n has also released its draft National Allocation Plan which provides a carbon cap-and-trade of million metric tonnes of CO \n million of which are set to be auctioned \n According to the OECD Economic Survey of Norway the nation \"has announced a target for 2008-12 10% below its commitment under the Kyoto Protocol and a 30% cut compared with by \" \n In EU-15 emissions was 1% below their base year level Based on figures for by the European Environment Agency EU-15 emissions averaged 8% below base-year levels during the 2008-2012 period This means the EU-15 over-achieved its first Kyoto target by a wide margin \n Tokyo Japan \n Tokyo Metropolitan Government \n The Japanese city of Tokyo is like a country in its own right in terms of its energy consumption and GDP Tokyo consumes as much energy as \"entire countries in Northern Europe and its production matches the GNP of the world's 16th largest country\" A scheme to limit carbon emissions launched in April covers the top emitters in Tokyo and is enforced and overseen by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government \n Phase which is similar to Japan's scheme ran until Japan had an ineffective voluntary emissions reductions system for years \n but no nationwide cap-and-trade program Emitters must cut their emissions by 6% or 8% depending on the type of organization from those who exceed their limits must buy matching allowances or invest in renewable-energy certificates or offset credits issued by smaller businesses or branch offices \n Polluters that fail to comply will be fined up to yen plus credits for times excess emissions \n In its fourth year emissions were reduced by 23% compared to base-year emissions \n In phase FY2015-FY2019 the target is expected to increase to 15%-17% The aim is to cut Tokyo's carbon emissions by 25% from levels by \n These emission limits can be met by using technologies such as solar panels and advanced fuel-saving devices \n United States \n Climate change in the United States \n and \n Acid Rain Program \n An early example of an emission trading system has been the SO \n trading system under the framework of the \n Acid Rain Program \n of the \n Clean Air Act \n in the U S Under the program which is essentially a cap-and-trade emissions trading system SO \n emissions were reduced by 50% from levels by \n Some experts argue that the cap-and-trade system of SO \n emissions reduction has reduced the cost of controlling acid rain by as much as 80% versus source-by-source reduction \n The SO \n program was challenged in which set in motion a series of events that led to the \n Cross-State Air Pollution Rule \n CSAPR Under the CSAPR the national SO \n trading program was replaced by four separate trading groups for SO \n and NO \n x \n California's cap-and-trade program ranks only second to the ETS European Trading System carbon market in the world \n In the State of \n Illinois \n adopted a trading program for \n volatile organic compounds \n in most of the Chicago area called the Emissions Reduction Market System \n Beginning in over major sources of pollution in eight Illinois counties began trading pollution credits \n In \n New York State \n proposed and attained commitments from nine \n Northeast \n states to form a cap-and-trade \n carbon dioxide \n emissions program for power generators called the \n Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative \n RGGI This program launched on January with the aim to reduce the carbon \"budget\" of each state's electricity generation sector to 10% below their allowances by \n Also in U S corporations were able to trade CO \n emission allowances on the \n Chicago Climate Exchange \n under a voluntary scheme In August the Exchange announced a mechanism to create \n emission offsets \n for projects within the United States that cleanly destroy \n ozone \n -depleting substances \n Also in the Environmental Protection Agency EPA began to administer the NOx Budget Trading Program NBP under the NOx State Implementation Plan also known as the \"NOx SIP Call\" The NOx Budget Trading Program was a market-based cap and trade program created to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides NO \n x \n from power plants and other large combustion sources in the eastern United States NO \n x \n is a prime ingredient in the formation of ground-level ozone smog a pervasive air pollution problem in many areas of the eastern United States The NBP was designed to reduce NO \n x \n emissions during the warm summer months referred to as the ozone season when ground-level ozone concentrations are highest \n In March EPA again strengthened the 8-hour ozone standard to parts per million ppm from its previous ppm \n In the \n California Legislature \n passed the California Global Warming Solutions Act \n AB-32 \n which was signed into law by Governor \n Arnold Schwarzenegger \n Thus far flexible mechanisms in the form of project based offsets have been suggested for three main project types The project types include \n manure management \n forestry and destruction of ozone-depleted substances However a recent ruling from Judge Ernest H Goldsmith of San Francisco's Superior Court states that the rules governing California's cap-and-trade system were adopted without a proper analysis of alternative methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \n The tentative ruling issued on January argues that the \n California Air Resources Board \n violated state environmental law by failing to consider such alternatives If the decision is made final the state would not be allowed to implement its proposed cap-and-trade system until the California Air Resources Board fully complies with the \n California Environmental Quality Act \n In February five U S states and four Canadian provinces joined together to create the \n Western Climate Initiative \n WCI a regional greenhouse gas emissions trading system \n In July a meeting took place to further outline the cap-and-trade system \n In November Arizona Montana New Mexico Oregon Utah and Washington withdrew from the WCI \n On November President-elect \n Barack Obama \n clarified in a talk recorded for \n YouTube \n his intentions for the US to enter a cap-and-trade system to limit \n global warming \n SO \n emissions from Acid Rain Program sources have fallen from million tons in to about million tons in a decrease in emissions of percent Ozone season NOx emissions decreased by percent between and even while energy demand remained essentially flat during the same period CAIR will result in $85 billion to $100 billion in health benefits and nearly $2 billion in visibility benefits per year by and will substantially reduce premature mortality in the eastern United States \n citation needed \n A recent EPA analysis shows that implementation of the Acid Rain Program is expected \n by whom? \n to reduce between and incidences of premature mortality annually due to reductions of ambient PM2 concentrations and between and incidences annually due to reductions of ground-level ozone NOx reductions due to the NOx Budget Trading Program have led to improvements in ozone and PM2 saving an estimated to lives in \n The \n United States federal budget \n proposes to support clean energy development with a 10-year investment of US $15 billion per year generated from the sale of greenhouse gas GHG emissions credits Under the proposed cap-and-trade program all GHG emissions credits would be auctioned off generating an estimated $78 billion in additional revenue in FY steadily increasing to $83 billion by FY \n The \n American Clean Energy and Security Act \n H R a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade bill was passed on June in the House of Representatives by a vote of 219-212 The bill originated in the House Energy and Commerce Committee and was introduced by Representatives Henry A Waxman and Edward J Markey \n The political advocacy organizations \n FreedomWorks \n and \n Americans for Prosperity \n funded by \n brothers David and Charles Koch \n of \n Koch Industries \n encouraged the \n Tea Party movement \n to focus on defeating the legislation \n Although cap and trade also gained a significant foothold in the Senate via the efforts of Republican \n Lindsey Graham \n Independent and former Democrat \n Joe Lieberman \n and Democrat \n John Kerry \n the legislation died in the Senate \n In under the auction the reserve price which is the price per ton of CO2 permit is $10 Some of the emitters obtain allowances for free which is for the electric utilities industrial facilities and natural gas distributors whereas some of the others have to go to the auction \n South Korea \n South Korea's national emissions trading scheme officially launched on January covering entities from sectors With a three-year cap of billion tCO2e it now forms the second largest carbon market in the world following the EU ETS This amounts to roughly two thirds of the country's emissions The Korean emissions trading scheme is part of the Republic of Korea's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% compared to the business-as-usual scenario by \n China \n In November China approved pilot tests of carbon trading in seven provinces and cities Beijing Chongqing Shanghai Shenzhen Tianjin as well as Guangdong Province and Hubei Province with different prices in each region \n The pilot is intended to test the waters and provide valuable lessons for the design of a national system in the near future Their successes or failures will therefore have far reaching implications for carbon market development in China in terms of trust in a national carbon trading market Some of the pilot regions can start trading as early as 2013/2014 \n National trading is expected to start in latest in China currently emits about 30% of global emissions and it became the largest emitter in the world When the market launched it will be the largest carbon market in the world It has made a voluntary pledge under the UNFCCC to lower CO2 per unit of GDP by to 45% in when comparing to the levels \n India \n Trading is set to begin in after a three-year rollout period It is a mandatory energy efficiency trading scheme covering eight sectors responsible for per cent of Indias industrial energy consumption India has pledged a to per cent reduction in emissions intensity from levels by Under the scheme annual efficiency targets will be allocated to firms Tradable energy-saving permits will be issued depending on the amount of energy saved during a target year \n Renewable energy certificates \n Renewable Energy Certificates \n Renewable Energy Certificates \n occasionally referred to as or \"green tags\" citation required are a largely unrelated form of market-based instruments that are used to achieve renewable energy targets which may be environmentally motivated like emissions reduction targets but may also be motivated by other aims such as energy security or industrial policy \n Carbon market \n Carbon emission trading \n Carbon emissions trading is emissions trading specifically for \n carbon dioxide \n calculated in tonnes of \n carbon dioxide equivalent \n or tCO \n e and currently makes up the bulk of emissions trading It is one of the ways countries can meet their obligations under the \n Kyoto Protocol \n to reduce carbon emissions and thereby \n mitigate global warming \n personal carbon trading \n and \n carbon offset \n Market trend \n Trading can be done directly between buyers and sellers through several organised exchanges or through the many intermediaries active in the carbon market The price of allowances is determined by supply and demand As many as million allowances have been traded per day In billion allowances were traded with a total value of billion \n Carbon emissions trading declined in and is expected to decline in \n According to the \n World Bank \n 's Carbon Finance Unit million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent tCO \n e were exchanged through projects in a 240% increase relative to mtCO \n e \n which was itself a 41% increase relative to mtCO \n e \n Global carbon markets have shrunk in value by 60% since but are expected to rise again in \n In terms of dollars the World Bank has estimated that the size of the carbon market was billion USD in billion USD in \n and billion in \n The Marrakesh Accords of the Kyoto protocol defined the international trading mechanisms and registries needed to support trading between countries \n sources can buy or sell allowances on the open market Because the total number of allowances is limited by the cap emission reductions are assured \n Allowance trading now occurs between European countries and Asian countries However while the USA as a nation did not ratify the Protocol many of its states are developing cap-and-trade systems and considering ways to link them together nationally and internationally to find the lowest costs and improve liquidity of the market \n However these states also wish to preserve their individual integrity and unique features For example in contrast to other Kyoto-compliant systems some states propose other types of greenhouse gas sources different measurement methods setting a maximum on the price of allowances or restricting access to CDM projects Creating instruments that are not \n fungible \n exchangeable could introduce instability and make pricing difficult Various proposals for linking these systems across markets are being investigated and this is being coordinated by the \n International Carbon Action Partnership \n ICAP \n Business reaction \n In Barclays Capital predicted that the new carbon market would be worth $70 billion worldwide that year \n The voluntary offset market by comparison is projected to grow to about $4bn by \n multinational corporations \n came together in the \n G8 Climate Change Roundtable \n a business group formed at the January \n World Economic Forum \n The group included \n Ford \n Toyota \n British Airways \n BP \n and \n Unilever \n On June the Group published a statement stating the need to act on climate change and stressing the importance of market-based solutions It called on governments to establish \"clear transparent and consistent price signals\" through \"creation of a long-term policy framework\" that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases \n By December this had grown to encompass global businesses \n Business in the UK have come out strongly in support of emissions trading as a key tool to mitigate climate change supported by NGOs \n However not all businesses favor a trading approach On December \n Rex Tillerson \n the CEO of \n Exxonmobil \n said a \n carbon tax \n is \"a more direct more transparent and more effective approach\" than a cap-and-trade program which he said \"inevitably introduces unnecessary cost and complexity\" He also said that he hoped that the revenues from a carbon tax would be used to lower other taxes so as to be revenue neutral \n The \n International Air Transport Association \n whose member airlines comprise 93% of all international traffic position is that trading should be based on \"benchmarking\" setting emissions levels based on industry averages rather than \" \n grandfathering \n \" which would use individual companies previous emissions levels to set their future permit allowances They argue grandfathering \"would penalise airlines that took early action to modernise their fleets while a benchmarking approach if designed properly would reward more efficient operations\" \n Measuring reporting verification \n This section \n needs additional or better citations for \n verification \n Please help \n improve this article \n by \n adding citations to reliable sources \n Unsourced material may be challenged and removed \n September \n Learn how and when to remove this template message \n Assuring compliance with an emissions trading scheme requires measuring reporting and verification MRV \n Measurements are needed at each operator or installation These measurements are reported to a regulator For greenhouse gases all trading countries maintain an inventory of emissions at national and installation level in addition trading groups within North America maintain inventories at the state level through \n The Climate Registry \n For trading between regions these inventories must be consistent with equivalent units and measurement techniques \n In some industrial processes emissions can be physically measured by inserting sensors and flowmeters in chimneys and stacks but many types of activity rely on theoretical calculations instead of measurement Depending on local legislation measurements may require additional checks and verification by government or third party \n auditors \n prior or post submission to the local regulator \n Enforcement \n In contrast to an ordinary market in a pollution market the amount purchased is not necessarily the amount 'consumed' = the amount of pollution emitted A firm might buy a small amount of allowances but emit a much larger amount of pollution This creates a troublesome \n moral hazard \n problem \n This problem may be solved by a centralized regulator The regulator should perform Measuring Reporting and Verification MRV of the actual pollution levels and \n enforce \n the allowances \n Without effective MRV and enforcement the value of allowances diminishes Enforcement methods include \n fines \n and \n sanctions \n for polluters that have exceeded their allowances Concerns include the cost of MRV and enforcement and the risk that facilities may lie about actual emissions The net effect of a corrupt reporting system or poorly managed or financed regulator may be a discount on emission costs and a hidden increase in actual emissions \n According to Nordhaus strict enforcement of the Kyoto Protocol is likely to be observed in those countries and industries covered by the EU ETS \n Ellerman and Buchner commented on the European Commission's EC's role in enforcing scarcity of permits within the EU ETS \n This was done by the EC's reviewing the total number of permits that member states proposed that their industries be allocated Based on institutional and enforcement considerations Kruger \n et al \n suggested that emissions trading within developing countries might not be a realistic goal in the near-term \n Burniaux \n et al \n argued that due to the difficulty in enforcing international rules against sovereign states development of the carbon market would require negotiation and consensus-building \n An alternative to centralized regulation is distributed regulation in which the firms themselves are induced to inspect the other firms and report their misbehavior It is possible to implement such systems in \n subgame perfect equilibrium \n Moore and Repullo \n present an implementation with unbounded fines Kahana and Mealem and Nitzan \n present an implementation with bounded fines Their work extends the work of Duggan and Roberts \n by adding a second component which takes care of the moral hazard \n Criticism \n Chicago Climate Justice activists protesting cap and trade legislation in front of \n Chicago Climate Exchange \n building in Chicago Loop \n Emissions trading has been criticised for a variety of reasons \n For example in the popular science magazine \n New Scientist \n Lohmann argued that trading pollution allowances should be avoided as a climate stabilization policy for several reasons First climate change requires more radical changes than previous pollution trading schemes such as the US SO \n market It requires reorganizing society and technology to \"leave most remaining fossil fuels safely underground\" Carbon trading schemes have tended to reward the heaviest polluters with 'windfall profits' when they are granted enough carbon credits to match historic production Expensive long-term structural changes will not be made if there are cheaper sources of carbon credits which are often available from less developed countries where they may be generated by local polluters at the expense of local communities \n Research by Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg has shown that the flexibility and thus complexity inherent in cap and trade schemes has resulted in a great deal of \n policy uncertainty \n surrounding these schemes Such uncertainty has beset such schemes in Australia Canada China the EU India Japan New Zealand and the US As a result of this uncertainty organizations have little incentive to innovate and comply resulting in an ongoing battle of stakeholder contestation for the past two decades \n Lohmann 2006b supported conventional regulation green taxes and energy policies that are \"justice-based\" and \"community-driven \" \n According to Carbon Trade Watch carbon trading has had a \"disastrous track record \" The effectiveness of the EU ETS was criticized and it was argued that the CDM had routinely favoured \"environmentally ineffective and socially unjust projects \" \n Annie Leonard \n 's documentary \n The Story of Cap and Trade \n criticized carbon emissions trading for the free permits to major polluters giving them unjust advantages cheating in connection with \n carbon offsets \n and as a distraction from the search for other solutions \n Offsets \n Forest campaigner Jutta Kill of European environmental group \n FERN \n argued that offsets for emission reductions were not substitute for actual cuts in emissions Kill stated that \" carbon in trees is temporary Trees can easily release carbon into the atmosphere through fire disease climatic changes natural decay and timber harvesting \" \n Permit supply level \n Regulatory agencies run the risk of issuing too many emission credits which can result in a very low price on emission permits \n This reduces the incentive that permit-liable firms have to cut back their emissions On the other hand issuing too few permits can result in an excessively high permit price \n This an argument for a hybrid instrument having a price-floor i e a minimum permit price and a price-ceiling i e a limit on the permit price However a price-ceiling safety value removes the certainty of a particular quantity limit of emissions \n Permit allocation versus auctioning \n If polluters receive emission permits for free \"grandfathering\" this may be a reason for them not to cut their emissions because if they do they will receive fewer permits in the future \n This \n perverse incentive \n can be alleviated if permits are auctioned i e sold to polluters rather than giving them the permits for free \n Auctioning is a method for distributing emission allowances in a cap-and-trade system whereby allowances are sold to the highest bidder Revenues from auctioning go to the government and can be used for development of sustainable technology \n or to cut \n distortionary \n taxes thus improving the efficiency of the overall cap policy \n On the other hand allocating permits can be used as a measure to protect domestic firms who are internationally exposed to competition \n This happens when domestic firms compete against other firms that are not subject to the same regulation This argument in favor of allocation of permits has been used in the EU ETS where industries that have been judged to be internationally exposed e g cement and steel production have been given permits for free \n This method of distribution may be combined with other forms of allowance distribution \n Distributional effects \n The US \n Congressional Budget Office \n CBO examined the potential effects of the \n American Clean Energy and Security Act \n on US households \n This act relies heavily on the free allocation of permits The Bill was found to protect low-income consumers but it was recommended that the Bill be made more efficient by reducing welfare provisions for corporations and more resources be made available for consumer relief \n Linking \n Distinct cap-and-trade systems can be linked together through the mutual or unilateral recognition of emissions allowances for compliance Linking systems creates a larger carbon market which can reduce overall compliance costs increase market liquidity and generate a more stable carbon market \n Linking systems can also be politically symbolic as it shows willingness to undertake a common effort to reduce GHG emissions \n Some scholars have argued that linking may provide a starting point for developing a new bottom-up international climate policy architecture whereby multiple unique systems successively link their various systems \n In the U S state of California and the Canadian province of Qubec successfully linked their systems In the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba agreed to join the linked system between Quebec and California \n The \n International Carbon Action Partnership \n brings together regional national and sub-national governments and public authorities from

extinction is generally considered to be the death of the \n last individual \n of the species although the \n capacity to breed and recover \n may have been lost before this point Because a species' potential \n range \n may be very large determining this moment is difficult and is usually done retrospectively This difficulty leads to phenomena such as \n Lazarus taxa \n where a species presumed extinct abruptly \"reappears\" typically in the \n fossil record \n after a period of apparent absence \n More than percent of all species amounting to over five billion species \n that ever \n lived \n on Earth are estimated to be extinct \n Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from million to million \n of which about million have been documented and over percent have not yet been described \n More recently in May scientists reported that trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described \n Through \n evolution \n species arise through the process of \n speciation \n where new varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an \n ecological niche \n and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition The relationship between animals and their ecological niches has been firmly established \n A typical species becomes extinct within million years of its first appearance \n although some species called \n living fossils \n survive with virtually no \n morphological \n change for hundreds of millions of years \n Mass extinctions \n are relatively rare events however isolated extinctions are quite common Only recently have extinctions been recorded and scientists have become alarmed at the \n current high rate of extinctions \n Most species that become extinct are never scientifically documented Some scientists estimate that up to half of presently existing plant and animal species may become extinct

become \n functionally extinct \n when only a handful of individuals survive which cannot reproduce due to poor health age sparse distribution over a large range a lack of individuals of both sexes in \n sexually reproducing \n species or other reasons \n Pinpointing the extinction or \n pseudoextinction \n of a species requires a \n clear definition of that species \n If it is to be declared extinct the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor or daughter species and from any other closely related species Extinction of a species or replacement by a daughter species plays a key role in the \n punctuated equilibrium \n hypothesis of \n Stephen Jay Gould \n and \n Niles Eldredge \n Skeleton of various extinct \n dinosaurs \n some other dinosaur lineages still flourish in the form of \n birds \n In \n ecology \n extinction \n is often used informally to refer to \n local extinction \n in which a species ceases to exist in the chosen area of study but may still exist elsewhere This phenomenon is also known as extirpation Local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations \n wolf reintroduction \n is an example of this Species which are not extinct are termed \n extant \n Those that are extant but threatened by extinction are referred to as \n threatened \n or \n endangered species \n The \n dodo \n of \n Mauritius \n shown here in a illustration by \n Roelant Savery \n is an often-cited example of \n modern extinction \n Currently an important aspect of extinction is human attempts to preserve critically endangered species These are reflected by the creation of the \n conservation status \n \"extinct in the wild\" EW \n Species listed under this status by the \n International Union for Conservation of Nature \n IUCN are not known to have any living specimens in the wild and are maintained only in \n zoos \n or other artificial environments Some of these species are functionally extinct as they are no longer part of their natural habitat and it is unlikely the species will ever be restored to the wild \n When possible modern \n zoological \n institutions try to maintain a \n viable population \n for species preservation and possible future \n reintroduction \n to the wild through use of carefully planned \n breeding programs \n The extinction of one species' wild population can have knock-on effects causing further extinctions These are also called \"chains of extinction\" \n This is especially common with extinction of \n keystone species \n Pseudoextinction \n Pseudoextinction \n Extinction of a parent species where daughter species or subspecies are still extant is called pseudoextinction or phyletic extinction Effectively the old taxon vanishes transformed \n anagenesis \n into a successor \n or split into more than one \n cladogenesis \n Pseudoextinction is difficult to demonstrate unless one has a strong chain of evidence linking a living species to members of a pre-existing species For example it is sometimes claimed that the extinct \n Hyracotherium \n which was an early horse that shares a common ancestor with the modern \n horse \n is pseudoextinct rather than extinct because there are several extant species of \n Equus \n including \n zebra \n and \n donkey \n However as fossil species typically leave no genetic material behind one cannot say whether \n Hyracotherium \n evolved into more modern horse species \n or merely evolved from a common ancestor with modern horses Pseudoextinction is much easier to demonstrate for larger taxonomic groups \n Lazarus taxa \n Lazarus taxa \n The \n coelacanth \n a fish related to \n lungfish \n and \n tetrapods \n was considered to have been extinct since the end of the \n Cretaceous Period \n until when a specimen was found off the \n Chalumna River \n now Tyolomnqa on the east coast of South Africa \n Museum curator \n Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer \n discovered the fish among the catch of a local angler Captain Hendrick Goosen on December \n A local chemistry professor \n JLB Smith \n confirmed the fish's importance with a famous cable \"MOST IMPORTANT PRESERVE SKELETON AND GILLS = FISH DESCRIBED\" \n Far more recent possible or presumed extinctions of species which may turn out still to exist include the thylacine or \n Tasmanian tiger \n Thylacinus cynocephalus \n the last known example of which died in Hobart Zoo in Tasmania in the \n Japanese wolf \n Canis lupus hodophilax \n last sighted over years ago the \n ivory-billed woodpecker \n Campephilus principalis \n last sighted for certain in and the \n slender-billed curlew \n Numenius tenuirostris \n not seen since \n Causes \n The \n passenger pigeon \n one of hundreds of species of \n extinct birds \n was hunted to extinction over the course of a few decades \n As long as species have been evolving species have been going extinct It is estimated that over 9% of all species that ever lived are extinct The average lifespan of a species is million years \n although this varies widely between taxa There are a variety of causes that can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species \"Just as each species is unique\" write Beverly and \n Stephen C Stearns \n \"so is each extinction the causes for each are variedsome subtle and complex others obvious and simple\" \n Most simply any species that cannot \n survive \n and \n reproduce \n in its environment and cannot move to a new environment where it can do so dies out and becomes extinct Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely as when \n toxic \n pollution \n renders its entire \n habitat \n unliveable or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors Extinction may occur a long time after the events that set it in motion a phenomenon known as \n extinction debt \n Assessing the relative importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the debate on \n nature and nurture \n The question of whether more extinctions in the \n fossil \n record have been caused by \n evolution \n or by catastrophe is a subject of discussion Mark Newman the author of \n Modeling Extinction \n argues for a mathematical model that falls between the two positions \n By contrast \n conservation biology \n uses the \n extinction vortex \n model to classify extinctions by cause When concerns about \n human extinction \n have been raised for example in Sir \n Martin Rees \n ' book \n Our Final Hour \n those concerns lie with the effects of \n climate change \n or \n technological \n disaster \n Currently environmental groups and some governments are concerned with the extinction of species caused by humanity and they try to prevent further extinctions through a variety of \n conservation \n programs \n Humans can cause extinction of a species through \n overharvesting \n pollution \n habitat destruction \n introduction of \n invasive species \n such as new \n predators \n and food \n competitors \n overhunting and other influences Explosive unsustainable human \n population growth \n is an essential cause of the extinction crisis \n According to the \n International Union for Conservation of Nature \n IUCN extinctions have been recorded since the year the arbitrary date selected to define \"recent\" extinctions up to the year with many more likely to have gone unnoticed Several species have also been listed as extinct since \n Genetics and demographic phenomena \n Extinction vortex \n Genetic erosion \n and \n Mutational meltdown \n If \n adaptation \n increasing population \n fitness \n is slower than environmental degradation plus the accumulation of slightly deleterious \n mutations \n then a population will go extinct \n Smaller populations have fewer beneficial mutations entering the population each generation slowing adaptation It is also easier for slightly deleterious mutations to \n fix \n in small populations the resulting positive feedback loop between small population size and low fitness can cause \n mutational meltdown \n Limited geographic range is the most important determinant of \n genus \n extinction at background rates but becomes increasingly irrelevant as \n mass extinction \n arises \n Limited geographic range is a cause both of small population size and of greater vulnerability to local environnmental catastrophes \n Extinction rates can be affected not just by population size but by any factor that affects \n evolvability \n including \n balancing selection \n cryptic genetic variation \n phenotypic plasticity \n and \n robustness \n A diverse or deep \n gene pool \n gives a population a higher chance in the short term of surviving an adverse change in conditions Effects that cause or reward a loss in \n genetic diversity \n can increase the chances of extinction of a species \n Population bottlenecks \n can dramatically reduce genetic diversity by severely limiting the number of reproducing individuals and make \n inbreeding \n more frequent \n Genetic pollution \n Genetic pollution \n Purebred \n wild species evolved to a specific ecology can be threatened with extinction \n through the process of \n genetic pollution \n i e uncontrolled \n hybridization \n introgression \n genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or \n out-competition \n from the introduced \n or hybrid \n species \n Endemic populations can face such extinctions when new populations are imported or \n selectively bred \n by people or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact Extinction is likeliest for \n rare species \n coming into contact with more abundant ones \n interbreeding \n can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids depleting the purebred gene pool for example the endangered \n wild water buffalo \n is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from \n the abundant domestic water buffalo \n Such extinctions are not always apparent from \n morphological \n non-genetic observations Some degree of \n gene flow \n is a normal evolutionarily process nevertheless hybridization with

bottlenecks \n reduces the range of adaptions possible \n Replacing native with alien genes narrows genetic diversity within the original population \n thereby increasing the chance of extinction \n Scorched land resulting from \n slash-and-burn \n agriculture \n Habitat degradation \n Habitat destruction \n Habitat degradation is currently the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture with urban sprawl logging mining and some fishing practices close behind The degradation of a species' \n habitat \n may alter the \n fitness landscape \n to such an extent that the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct This may occur by direct effects such as the environment becoming \n toxic \n or indirectly by limiting a species' ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species \n Habitat degradation through toxicity can kill off a species very rapidly by killing all living members through \n contamination \n or \n sterilizing \n them It can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span reproductive capacity or competitiveness \n Habitat degradation can also take the form of a physical destruction of niche habitats The widespread destruction of \n tropical rainforests \n and replacement with open pastureland is widely cited as an example of this \n elimination of the dense forest eliminated the infrastructure needed by many species to survive For example a \n fern \n that depends on dense shade for protection from direct sunlight can no longer survive without forest to shelter it Another example is the destruction of ocean floors by \n bottom trawling \n Diminished resources or introduction of new competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation \n Global warming \n has allowed some species to expand their range bringing unwelcome \n according to whom? \n competition to other species that previously occupied that area Sometimes these new competitors are predators and directly affect prey species while at other times they may merely outcompete vulnerable species for limited resources Vital resources including \n water \n and food can also be limited during habitat degradation leading to extinction \n The \n golden toad \n was last seen on May \n Decline in amphibian populations \n is ongoing worldwide \n Predation competition and disease \n Island restoration \n In the natural course of events species become extinct for a number of reasons including but not limited to extinction of a necessary host prey or pollinator inter-species competition inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions particularly sudden changes which can act to introduce novel predators or to remove prey Recently in geological time humans have become an additional cause of extinction many people would say premature extinction of some species either as a new mega-predator or by \n transporting \n animals \n and \n plants \n from one part of the world to another Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years sometimes intentionally e g \n livestock \n released by sailors on islands as a future source of food and sometimes accidentally e g \n rats \n escaping from boats In most cases the introductions are unsuccessful but when an \n invasive alien species \n does become established the consequences can be catastrophic Invasive alien species can affect \n native \n species directly by eating them competing with them and introducing \n pathogens \n or \n parasites \n that sicken or kill them or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators According to the \"overkill hypothesis\" the swift extinction of the \n megafauna \n in areas such as Australia years before present \n North \n and \n South America \n years before present \n Madagascar \n Hawaii \n CE and New Zealand CE resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques \n Coextinction \n Coextinction \n The large \n Haast's eagle \n and \n moa \n from New Zealand \n Coextinction refers to the loss of a species due to the extinction of another for example the extinction of \n parasitic \n insects following the loss of their hosts Coextinction can also occur when a species loses its \n pollinator \n or to \n predators \n in a \n food chain \n who lose their prey \"Species coextinction is a manifestation of the interconnectedness of organisms in complex ecosystems While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions it is certainly an insidious one\" \n Coextinction is especially common when a \n keystone species \n goes extinct Models suggest that coextinction is the most common form of biodiversity loss There may be a cascade of coextinction across the \n trophic levels \n Such effects are most severe in \n mutualistic \n and parasitic relationships An example of coextinction is the \n Haast's eagle \n and the \n moa \n the Haast's eagle was a predator that became extinct because its food source became extinct The moa were several species of flightless birds that were a food source for the Haast's eagle \n Climate change \n Extinction risk from global warming \n Effect of climate change on plant biodiversity \n Effects of climate change on terrestrial animals \n and \n Effects of climate change on marine mammals \n Extinction as a result of climate change has been confirmed by fossil studies \n Particularly the extinction of amphibians during the \n Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse \n million years ago \n A review across biodiversity research centers predicted that because of climate change 1537% of land species would be \"committed to extinction\" by \n The ecologically rich areas that would potentially suffer the heaviest losses include the \n Cape Floristic Region \n and the \n Caribbean Basin \n These areas might see a doubling of present carbon dioxide levels and rising temperatures that could eliminate plant and animal species \n Mass extinctions \n Extinction event \n Marine extinction intensity during the \n Phanerozoic \n % \n Millions

End-Capitanian extinction event \n are clickable hyperlinks see \n Extinction event \n for more details \n source and image info \n There have been at least five mass extinctions in the history of life on earth and four in the last million years in which many species have disappeared in a relatively short period of geological time A massive eruptive event is considered to be one likely cause of the \" \n PermianTriassic extinction event \n \" about million years ago \n which is estimated to have killed 90% of species then existing \n There is also evidence to suggest that this event was preceded by another mass extinction known as \n Olson's Extinction \n The \n CretaceousPaleogene extinction event \n K-Pg occurred million years ago at the end of the \n Cretaceous \n period and is best known for having wiped out non-avian \n dinosaurs \n among many other species \n Modern extinctions \n Holocene extinction \n Further information \n Deforestation \n and \n Defaunation \n According to a survey of biologists conducted by \n New York \n 's \n American Museum of Natural History \n nearly 70% believed that the Earth is currently in the early stages of a human-caused mass extinction \n known as the \n Holocene extinction \n In that survey the same proportion of respondents agreed with the prediction that up to 20% of all living populations could become extinct within years by A special edition of \n Science \n declared there is widespread consensus on the issue of human-driven mass species extinctions \n Biologist \n E O Wilson \n estimated \n in that if current rates of human destruction of the biosphere continue one-half of all plant and animal species of life on earth will be extinct in years \n More significantly the current rate of global species extinctions is estimated as to times \"background\" rates the average extinction rates in the \n evolutionary \n time scale of planet Earth \n while future rates are likely times higher \n However some groups are going extinct much faster Biologists \n Paul R Ehrlich \n and \n Stuart Pimm \n contend that \n human population growth \n is one of the main drivers of the modern extinction crisis \n History of scientific understanding \n Dilophosaurus \n one of the many extinct dinosaur genera The cause of the \n CretaceousPaleogene extinction event \n is a subject of much debate amongst researchers \n Georges Cuvier \n compared fossil \n mammoth \n jaws to those of living elephants concluding that they were distinct from any known living species \n For much of history the modern understanding of extinction as the end of a \n species \n was incompatible with the prevailing worldview Through the 18th century much of Western society adhered to the belief that the world was created by God and as such was complete and perfect \n This concept reached its heyday in the 1700s with the peak popularity of a theological concept called the \n Great Chain of Being \n in which all life on earth from the tiniest microorganism to God is linked in a continuous chain \n The extinction of a species was impossible under this model as it would create gaps or missing links in the chain and destroy the natural order \n Thomas Jefferson \n was a firm supporter of the \n Great Chain of Being \n and an opponent of extinction \n famously denying the extinction of the wooly mammoth on the grounds that nature never allows a race of animals to become extinct \n A series of fossils were discovered in the late 17th century that appeared unlike any living species As a result the scientific community embarked on a voyage of creative rationalization seeking to understand what had happened to these species within a framework that did not account for total extinction In October \n Robert Hooke \n presented an impression of a \n nautilus \n to the \n Royal Society \n that was more than two feet in diameter \n and morphologically distinct from any known living species \n Hooke \n theorized that this was simply because the species lived in the deep ocean and no one had discovered them yet \n While he contended that it was possible a species could be \"lost\" he thought this highly unlikely \n Similarly in \n Thomas Molyneux \n published an account of enormous antlers found in \n Ireland \n that did not belong to any extant taxa in that area \n Molyneux reasoned that they came from the North American \n moose \n and that the animal had once been common on the \n British Isles \n Rather than suggest that this indicated the possibility of species going extinct he argued that although organisms could become locally extinct they could never be entirely lost and would continue to exist in some unknown region of the globe \n Using the antlers as evidence for this position Molyneux described how moose had continued to exist in North America even as they were lost to the British Isles \n The antlers were later confirmed to be from the extinct Irish elk \n Megaloceros \n Hooke and Molyneux's line of thinking was difficult to disprove When parts of the world had not been thoroughly examined and charted scientists could not rule out that animals found only in the fossil record were not simply \"hiding\" in unexplored regions of the Earth \n Georges Cuvier \n is credited with establishing the modern conception of extinction in a lecture to the \n French Institute \n though he would spent most of his career trying to convince the wider scientific community of his theory \n Cuvier was a well-regarded geologist lauded for his ability to reconstruct the anatomy of an unknown species from a few fragments of bone \n His primary evidence for extinction came from mammoth skulls found in the \n Paris basin \n Cuvier recognized them as distinct from any known living species of elephant and argued that it was highly unlikely such an enormous animal would go undiscovered \n In Cuvier along with \n Alexandre Bronigniart \n & \n Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire \n mapped the \n strata \n of the Paris basin \n They saw alternating saltwater and freshwater deposits as well as patterns of the appearance and disappearance of fossils throughout the record \n From these patterns Cuvier inferred historic cycles of catastrophic flooding extinction and repopulation of the earth with new species \n Cuviers fossil evidence showed that very different life forms existed in the past than those that exist today a fact that was accepted by most scientists \n The primary debate focused whether this turnover caused by extinction was gradual or abrupt in nature \n Cuvier understood extinction to be the result of cataclysmic events that wipe out huge numbers of species as opposed to the gradual decline of a species over time \n His catastrophic view of the nature of extinction garnered him many opponents in the newly emerging school of \n uniformitarianism \n Jean-Baptist Lamarck \n a \n gradualist \n and colleague of Cuvier saw the fossils of different life forms as evidence of the mutable character of species \n While Lamarck did not deny the possibility of extinction he believed that it was exceptional and rare and that most of the change in species over time was due to gradual change \n Unlike Cuvier Lamarck was skeptical that catastrophic events of a scale large enough to cause total extinction were possible In his geological history of the earth titled Hydrogeologie Lamarck instead argued that the surface of the earth was shaped by gradual erosion and deposition by water and that species changed over time in response to the changing environment \n Charles Lyell \n a noted geologist and founder of \n uniformitarianism \n believed that past processes should be understood using present day processes Like Lamarck Lyell acknowledged that extinction could occur noting the total extinction of the \n dodo \n and the extirpation of \n indigenous horses \n to the British Isles \n He similarly argued against \n mass extinctions \n believing that any extinction must be a gradual process \n Lyell also showed that Cuviers original interpretation of the Parisian strata was incorrect Instead of the catastrophic floods inferred by Cuvier Lyell demonstrated that patterns of saltwater and freshwater \n deposits \n like those seen in the \n Paris basin \n could be formed by a slow rise and fall of \n sea levels \n The concept of extinction was integral to \n Charles Darwin \n s \n On the Origin of Species \n with less fit lineages disappearing over time For Darwin extinction was a constant side effect of \n competition \n Because of the wide reach of \n On the Origin of Species \n it was widely accepted that extinction occurred gradually and evenly a concept we now refer to as \n background extinction \n It was not until when \n David Raup \n and \n Jack Sepkoski \n published their seminal paper on mass extinctions that Cuvier was vindicated and catastrophic extinction was accepted as an important mechanism The current understanding of extinction is a synthesis of the cataclysmic extinction events proposed by Cuvier and the background extinction events proposed by Lyell and Darwin \n Human attitudes and interests \n Extinction is an important research topic in the field of \n zoology \n and \n biology \n in general and has also become an area of concern outside the scientific community A number of organizations such as the \n Worldwide Fund for Nature \n have been created with the goal of preserving species from extinction \n Governments \n have attempted through enacting laws to avoid habitat destruction agricultural over-harvesting and \n pollution \n While many human-caused extinctions have been accidental humans have also engaged in the deliberate destruction of some species such as dangerous \n viruses \n and the total destruction of other problematic species has been suggested Other species were deliberately driven to extinction or nearly so due to poaching or because they were \"undesirable\" or to push for other human agendas One example was the near extinction of the \n American bison \n which was nearly wiped out by mass hunts sanctioned by the United States government to force the removal of \n Native Americans \n many of whom relied on the bison for food \n Biologist Bruce Walsh of the \n University of Arizona \n states three reasons for scientific interest in the preservation of species genetic resources ecosystem stability and \n ethics \n and today the scientific community \"stress es the importance\" of maintaining biodiversity \n In modern times commercial and industrial interests often have to contend with the effects of production on plant and animal life However some technologies with minimal or no proven harmful effects on \n Homo sapiens \n can be devastating to wildlife for example \n DDT \n Biogeographer \n Jared Diamond \n notes that while \n big business \n may label environmental concerns as \"exaggerated\" and often cause \"devastating damage\" some corporations find it in their interest to adopt good conservation practices and even engage in preservation efforts that surpass those taken by \n national parks \n Governments sometimes see the loss of native species as a loss to \n ecotourism \n and can enact laws with severe punishment against the trade in native species in an effort to prevent extinction in the wild \n Nature preserves \n are created by governments as a means to provide continuing habitats to species crowded by human expansion The \n Convention on Biological Diversity \n has resulted in international \n Biodiversity Action Plan \n programmes which attempt to provide comprehensive guidelines for government biodiversity conservation Advocacy groups such as The Wildlands Project \n and the Alliance for Zero Extinctions \n work to educate the public and pressure governments into action \n People who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment leaving them highly exposed to extinction \n risks \n However people prioritize day-to-day survival over species conservation with \n human overpopulation \n in tropical \n developing countries \n there has been enormous pressure on forests due to \n subsistence agriculture \n including \n slash-and-burn \n agricultural techniques that can reduce endangered species's habitats \n Planned extinction \n Eradication of infectious diseases \n Completed \n The \n smallpox \n virus is now extinct in the wild \n although samples are retained in laboratory settings \n The \n rinderpest \n virus which infected domestic cattle is now extinct in the wild \n Proposed \n The \n poliovirus \n is now confined to small parts of the world due to extermination efforts \n Dracunculus medinensis \n a parasitic worm which causes the disease \n dracunculiasis \n is now close to eradication thanks to efforts led by the \n Carter Center \n Treponema pallidum pertenue \n a bacterium which causes the disease \n yaws \n is in the process of being eradicated \n Biologist \n Olivia Judson \n has advocated the deliberate extinction of certain disease-carrying \n mosquito \n species In a September \n New York Times \n article she advocated \"specicide\" of thirty mosquito species by introducing a genetic element which can insert itself into another crucial gene to create \n recessive \n \" \n knockout genes \n \" \n She says that the \n Anopheles \n mosquitoes which spread \n malaria \n and \n Aedes \n mosquitoes which spread \n dengue fever \n yellow fever \n elephantiasis \n and other diseases represent only species eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum at a cost of reducing the \n genetic diversity \n of the \n family \n Culicidae \n by only 1% She further argues that since species become extinct \"all the time\" the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the \n ecosystem \n \"We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other speciesbut different need not mean worse \" In addition anti-malarial and \n mosquito control programs \n offer little realistic hope to the million people in \n developing nations \n who will be infected with acute illnesses this year Although trials are ongoing she writes that if they fail \"We should consider the ultimate swatting \" \n Biologist \n E O Wilson \n has advocated the eradication of several species of mosquito including malaria vector \n Anopheles gambiae \n Wilson stated \"I'm talking about a very small number of species that have co-evolved with us and are preying on humans so it would certainly be acceptable to remove them I believe it's just common sense \" \n Cloning \n De-extinction \n Some such as Harvard geneticist \n George M Church \n believe that ongoing technological advances will let us \"bring back to life\" an extinct species by \n cloning \n using \n DNA \n from the remains of that species Proposed targets for cloning include the \n mammoth \n the \n thylacine \n and the \n Pyrenean ibex \n For this to succeed enough individuals would

E-governance \n Environmental social and \n corporate governance \n Market governance mechanism \n v \n t \n e \n Governance is a broader concept than government and also includes the roles played by the community sector and the private sector in managing and planning countries regions and cities \n Collaborative Governance \n involves the government community and private sectors communicating with each other and working together to achieve more than any one sector could achieve on its own Ansell and Gash have explored the conditions required for effective collaborative governance They say The ultimate goal is to develop a contingency approach of collaboration that can highlight conditions under which collaborative governance will be more or less effective as an approach to policy making and public management \n Collaborative governance covers both the informal and formal relationships in problem solving and decision-making Conventional government policy processes can be embedded in wider policy processes by facilitating collaboration between the public private and community sectors \n Collaborative Governance requires three things namely support leadership and a forum The support identifies the policy problem to be fixed The leadership gathers the sectors into a forum Then the members of the forum collaborate to develop policies solutions and answers \n There are many different forms of collaborative governance as such as \n Consensus Building \n and a \n Collaborative Network \n Consensus Building \n \"A process where stakeholders build consensus on actions to address specific public policy problems Community visioning is a process where members of a community build consensus on a descriptions of the communitys desired future and on actions to help make goals for the future a reality \" \n Collaborative Network \n This system is meant to accomplish more alignment among community needs strategies of service agencies priority outcomes and resource allocation Its also meant to accomplish building social capital integration of human service delivery and interconnected strategies for relationship building learning processes and measurement and modeling among the participants \n Definitions \n Advantages of Collaborative Governance \n Disadvantages of Collaborative Governance \n Social Applications \n Over the past two decades new collaborative approaches to governing and managing have developed in a range of fields including urban and regional planning public administration and law natural resource management and environmental management \n Collaborative governance \n has emerged as a response to the failures of government policy implementation and to the high cost and politicization of regulation and as an alternative to manageralism and adversarial approaches \n The field of \n public administration \n has changed its focus from \n bureaucracy \n to that of collaboration in the context of the \n network society \n Public administrators have blurred the lines between the people the private sector and the government Although bureaucracies still remain public administrators have begun to recognize that more can potentially be achieved by collaboration and networking \n Collaboration and partnerships are nothing new in the political realm however the wider use of this leadership style has gained momentum in recent years In part this is a response to \n neoliberalism \n with its focus on the primacy of the free-market economy and the private sector \n Definitions \n Ansell and Gash define collaborative governance as follows \n 'A governing arrangement where one or more public agencies directly engage non-state stakeholders in a collective decision-making process that is formal consensus-oriented and deliberative and that aims to make or implement public policy or manage public programs or assets' \n This definition involves six criteria the forum is initiated by public agencies participants in the forum include non-state actors participants engage in decision making and are not merely consulted the forum is formally organized the forum aims to make decisions by consensus and the focus of collaboration is on public policy or public management Emerson Nabatchi and Balogh have developed a less normative and less restrictive definition as follows \n 'The processes and structures of public policy decision making and management that engage people constructively across the boundaries of public agencies levels of government and/or the public private and civic spheres in order to carry out a public purpose that could not otherwise be accomplished ' \n This framework definition is a broader analytic concept and does not limit collaborative governance to state-initiated arrangements and to engagement between government and non-government sectors For example the definition encompasses collaboration between governments at different levels and hybrid partnerships initiated by the private or community sectors \n Advantages of Collaborative Governance \n The intent of collaborative governance is to improve the overall practice and effectiveness of public administration The advantages of effective collaborative governance are that it enables a better and shared understanding of complex problems involving many stakeholders and allows these stakeholders to work together and agree on solutions It can help policy makers identify and target problems and deliver action more effectively Stakeholders that are involved in developing a solution are more inclined to accept directions given or decisions made It can thus serve as a way to identify policy solutions that have greater traction in the community Additionally it can contribute new perspectives on issues and policy solutions and thus offer new ways to implement strategies for change For public officials who work in administration and management collaborative governance can serve as a way of genuinely allowing a wider array of ideas and suggestions in the policy process It may also be used to test ideas and analyze responses before implementation For those who are not involved in formal government it allows them to better understand the inner workings of government and carry more influence in the decision making process For both public and private sectors a commitment to collaboration is likely to drive organizational change and affect resource reallocation Other advantages include combining relevant skills and capacities as well as allowing specialization Overall collaborative governance can lead to mutual learning and shared experiences while also providing direction for institutional capacity building inside and outside agencies and organizations \n Disadvantages of Collaborative Governance \n The disadvantages of collaborative governance in relation to complex problems are that the process is time consuming it may not reach agreement on solutions and the relevant government agencies may not implement the agreed solutions In a complex structure with many entities working together individual roles can become unclear and confusing Some individuals act largely in a personal capacity while others may act on behalf of agencies or organizations Powerful stakeholder groups may seek to manipulate the process Structural issues also affect agendas and outcomes Open structures with loose leadership and membership allow multiple participants to gain access to a fast expanding agenda Achieving goals in such a wide agenda becomes more difficult as an increasing number of players struggle to resolve differences and coordinate actions Furthermore challenges arise for implementation when representatives are allowed to come and go with no real obligations to other collaborators Accountability of participating members unequal or hidden agendas trust between members power imbalances and language and cultural barriers are all issues that can arise in collaborative government regimes Critics argue that collaborative governance does not provide the institutional stability and consistency required and therefore deters progress \n The work of Ansell and Gash and Emerson Nabatchi and Balogh seeks to understand these issues and challenges and identify the social and process conditions required for effective collaborative governance \n Social Applications \n Collaborative governance has been used to address many complex social environmental and urban planning issues including flood crisis management and urban growth management in Australia community visioning and planning in New Zealand and public participation in the redesign of the Ground Zero site in New York \n In the UK the USA and countries across much of Western Europe governments have attempted to shift the focus towards various forms of co-production with other agencies and sectors and with citizens themselves in order to increase civic participation \n The classic forms of hierarchical governance and representative democracy are seen as inefficient when it comes to engaging citizens and making them a part of the decision making process Large projects and initiatives require involvement and communication with not only citizens but partnerships with other government and non-government agencies and in some instances international cooperation with foreign governments and organizations For example managing the growing number of official and non-official crossings of the US-Mexico border has required input from all levels of US and Mexican governments multiple government agencies like U S Forest Services and U S Border Patrol land management and other non-federal agencies for social affairs All of these parties had to communicate and collaborate to address issues of border security and protecting natural resources As a result the U S Border Patrol and Forest Service successfully enacted the terms of the memorandum of understanding creating inter-agency forums increasing field coordination and joint operations and constructing fences and other tactical infrastructure \n Governing and managing large and growing metropolitan urban areas covering numerous local governments and various levels of State and National governments provides many governance challenges and opportunities \n Abbott has reviewed metropolitan planning in South East Queensland SEQ Australia where collaborative governance arrangements between State and local governments and the regional community have evolved over a 20-year period leading to positive outputs and outcomes \n The positive outputs and outcomes of collaborative governance and metropolitan planning in SEQ have been extensive and broad and extend well beyond statutory regional land use planning \n These include three endorsed non-statutory regional plans two endorsed statutory regional plans an infrastructure program linked to the State budget regional sectoral plans for transport water supply natural resource management etc new legislation and institutional arrangements for metropolitan governance and capital works such as the SEQ busway

have already occurred Nevertheless the rapid recent increase in human population is causing some concern The population is \n expected \n to reach between and billion between the years \n and \n In May the United Nations increased the medium variant projections to billion for and billion for \n The recent rapid increase in human population over the past three centuries has raised concerns that the planet may not be able to sustain present or future numbers of inhabitants The \n InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth \n circa stated that many environmental problems such as rising levels of \n atmospheric carbon dioxide \n global warming \n and \n pollution \n are aggravated by the population expansion \n Other problems associated with overpopulation include the increased demand for resources such as fresh water and food \n starvation \n and \n malnutrition \n consumption of natural resources such as \n fossil fuels \n faster than the rate of regeneration and a deterioration in living conditions Wealthy but highly populated territories like \n Britain \n rely on food imports from overseas \n This was severely felt during the \n World Wars \n when despite food efficiency initiatives like \" \n dig for victory \n \" and \n food rationing \n Britain needed to \n fight to secure import routes \n However many believe that waste and \n over-consumption \n especially by wealthy nations is putting more strain on the environment than overpopulation \n Most countries have no direct policy of limiting their birth rates but the rates have still fallen due to education about family planning and increasing access to birth control and contraception Only \n China \n had imposed \n legal restrictions on having more than one child \n Extraterrestrial settlement \n and other technical solutions have been proposed as ways to mitigate overpopulation in the future \n History of concern \n Thousands of scooters make their way through \n Ho Chi Minh City \n Vietnam \n Concern about overpopulation is an ancient topic \n Tertullian \n was a resident of the city of \n Carthage \n in the second century \n CE \n when the population of the world was about million only 34% of what it is today He notably said \"What most frequently meets our view and occasions complaint is our teeming population Our numbers are burdensome to the world which can hardly support us In very deed pestilence and famine and wars and earthquakes have to be regarded as a remedy for nations as the means of pruning the luxuriance of the human race \" Before that \n Plato \n Aristotle \n and others broached the topic as well \n Throughout history population growth has usually been slow despite high \n birth rates \n due to war \n plagues \n and other diseases and high \n infant mortality \n During the years before the \n Industrial Revolution \n the world's population increased very slowly remaining under million \n By the beginning of the 19th century the world population had grown to a billion individuals and intellectuals such as \n Thomas Malthus \n predicted that mankind would outgrow its available resources because a finite amount of land would be incapable of supporting a population with a limitless potential for increase \n Mercantillists \n argued that a large population was a form of wealth which made it possible to create bigger markets and armies \n During the 19th century Malthus's work was often interpreted in a way that blamed the poor alone for their condition and helping them was said to worsen conditions in the long run \n This resulted for example in the \n English poor laws \n of \n and in a hesitating response to the \n Irish Great Famine \n of \n The UN Population Assessment Report of projects that the world population will plateau by and will remain stable until \n A study published in \n Science \n challenges this projection asserting that population growth will continue into the next century \n Adrian Raftery a \n University of Washington \n professor of statistics and sociology and one of the contributors to the study says \"The consensus over the past years or so was that world population which is currently around billion would go up to billion and level off or probably decline We found there's a percent probability the world population will not stabilize this century Population which had sort of fallen off the world's agenda remains a very important issue \" \n A more recent UN projection suggests the population could grow to as many as billion by \n Human population \n History of population growth \n World population \n Data from \n World Population \n Population \n Year \n Billion \n estimate \n The human population has gone through a number of periods of growth since the dawn of \n civilization \n in the \n Holocene \n period around BCE The beginning of civilization roughly coincides with the receding of \n glacial ice \n following the end of the \n last glacial period \n It is estimated that between million people subsisting on hunting and \n foraging \n inhabited the Earth in the period before the \n Neolithic Revolution \n when human activity shifted away from \n hunter-gathering \n and towards \n very primitive farming \n Around BCE at the \n dawn of agriculture \n the population of the world was approximately million \n The next several millennia saw a steady increase in the population with very rapid growth beginning in BCE and a peak of between and million people in BCE \n The \n Plague of Justinian \n caused \n Europe's population \n to drop by around 50% between and the 8th century \n Steady growth resumed in CE \n However growth was again disrupted by frequent \n plagues \n most notably the \n Black Death \n during the 14th century The effects of the Black Death are thought to have reduced the world's population then at an estimated million to between and million by \n The population of Europe stood at over million in \n these levels did not return until years later \n England's population reached an estimated million in up from an estimated million in \n New crops from the Americas via the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century contributed to the population growth \n In other parts of the globe China's population at the founding of the \n Ming dynasty \n in stood close to million approaching million by the end of the dynasty in \n The population of the Americas in may have been between and million \n Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local \n epidemics \n of extraordinary virulence Archaeological evidence indicates that the death of around 90% of the \n Native American population \n of the \n New World \n was caused by \n Old World \n diseases such as \n smallpox \n measles and influenza \n Europeans introduced diseases alien to the indigenous people therefore they did not have immunity to these foreign diseases \n After the start of the \n Industrial Revolution \n during the 18th century the rate of population growth began to increase By the end of the century the world's population was estimated at just under billion \n At the turn of the 20th century the world's population was roughly billion \n By this figure had increased to billion \n Population growth % \n World \n 4% \n Africa \n 4% \n Middle East \n 4% \n Asia except China \n 9% \n Latin America \n 0% \n OECD \n North America \n 1% \n China \n 3% \n OECD Europe \n 9% \n OECD Pacific \n 5% \n Non-OECD Europe and Eurasia \n -2 7% \n Dramatic growth beginning in above 8% per year coincided with greatly increased food production as a result of the industrialization of agriculture brought about by the \n Green Revolution \n The rate of human population growth peaked in at about 1% per year \n For example \n Indonesia \n 's population grew from million in to million in \n a 145% increase in years In \n India \n the population grew from million people in to just over billion by \n a 235% increase in years \n Continent \n population \n Africa \n million \n Asia \n million \n Europe \n million \n Latin America and Caribbean \n million \n North America \n million \n There is concern over the sharp population increase in many countries especially in \n Sub-Saharan Africa \n that has occurred over the last several decades and that it is creating problems with land management natural resources and access to water supplies \n The population of \n Chad \n has for example grown from in to in \n Niger \n Uganda \n Nigeria \n Tanzania \n Ethiopia \n and the \n DRC \n are witnessing a similar growth in population The situation is most acute in western central and eastern Africa \n Refugees from places like \n Sudan \n have further strained the resources of neighboring states like Chad and Egypt Chad is also host to roughly \n refugees \n from Sudan's \n Darfur \n region and about refugees from the \n Central African Republic \n while approximately Chadians have been displaced by their own civil war and famines have either fled to either the Sudan the Niger or more recently \n Libya \n Projections of population growth \n Projections of population growth \n Continent \n Projected population \n Africa \n billion \n Asia \n billion \n Europe \n million \n Latin America and Caribbean \n million \n North America \n million \n According to projections the world population will continue to grow until at least with the population reaching billion in \n and some \n predictions \n putting the population as high as billion in \n By the population could reach billion \n Walter Greiling \n projected in the 1950s that world population would reach a peak of about nine billion in the 21st century and then stop growing after a readjustment of the \n Third World \n and a sanitation of the tropics \n In the \n United Nations \n estimated that the world's population was growing at the rate of 14% or about million people per year and according to data from the CIA's \n World Factbook \n the world human population currently increases by every minute \n According to the United Nations' World Population Prospects report \n Net annual human population increase by country \n The \n world population \n is currently growing by approximately million people per year Current United Nations predictions estimate that the world population will reach billion around assuming a decrease in average \n fertility rate \n from down to \n Almost all growth will take place in the less developed regions where today's billion population of underdeveloped countries is expected to increase to billion in By contrast the population of the more developed regions will remain mostly unchanged at billion An exception is the United States population which is expected to increase by 44% from to \n In the average world fertility was children per woman about half the level in children per woman In the medium variant global fertility is projected to decline further to children per woman \n During nine countries are expected to account for half of the world's projected population increase \n India \n Pakistan \n Nigeria \n Democratic Republic of the Congo \n Bangladesh \n Uganda United States Ethiopia and China listed according to the size of their contribution to population growth China would be higher still in this list were it not for its \n one-child policy \n Global life expectancy at birth is expected to continue rising from years in to years in In the more developed regions the projection is to years by Among the least developed countries where life expectancy today is just under years it is expected to increase to years by \n The population of countries or areas is expected to be lower in than in \n During the net number of international migrants to more developed regions is projected to be million Because deaths are projected to exceed births in the more developed regions by million during population growth in those regions will largely be due to international migration \n In net migration in countries either prevented \n population decline \n or doubled at least the contribution of natural increase births minus deaths to population growth \n Birth rates \n are now falling in a small percentage of \n developing countries \n while the actual populations in many \n developed countries \n would fall without immigration \n Urban growth \n Urban areas with at least one million inhabitants in 3% of the world's population lived in cities in rising to 47% at the end of the twentieth century \n In only 3% of the \n world's population \n lived in cities By the 20th century's close 47% did so In there were cities with populations exceeding one million but by this had risen to agglomerations of more than one million \n If the trend continues the world's \n urban population \n will double every years according to researchers The UN forecasts that today's urban population of billion will rise to nearly billion by when three out of five people will live in cities \n The increase will be most dramatic in the poorest and least-urbanised continents Asia and Africa Projections indicate that most urban growth over the next years will be in \n developing countries \n One billion people one-seventh of the world's population or one-third of urban population now live in \n shanty towns \n which are seen as \"breeding grounds\" for social problems such as crime \n drug addiction \n citation needed \n alcoholism poverty and unemployment In many poor countries \n slums \n exhibit high rates of disease due to unsanitary conditions malnutrition and lack of basic health care \n In there were \n megacities \n conurbations \n such as Tokyo \n Beijing \n Guangzhou \n Seoul \n Karachi \n Mexico City \n Mumbai \n So Paulo London and New York City that have populations in excess of million inhabitants \n Greater Tokyo \n already has million more than the entire population of Canada at million \n According to the \n Far Eastern Economic Review \n Asia alone will have at least 'hypercities' by that is cities inhabited by more than million people including \n Jakarta \n million people \n Dhaka \n million \n Karachi \n million \n Shanghai \n million and \n Mumbai \n million \n Lagos \n has grown from in to an estimated million today and the Nigerian government estimates that city will have expanded to million residents by \n Chinese experts forecast that Chinese cities will contain million people by \n Causes \n Street in \n Kathmandu \n From a historical perspective \n technological revolutions \n have coincided with population explosions There have been three major technological revolutions the tool-making revolution the \n agricultural revolution \n and the \n industrial revolution \n all of which allowed humans more access to food resulting in subsequent population explosions \n For example the use of tools such as bow and arrow allowed primitive hunters greater access to high energy foods e g animal meat Similarly the transition to farming about years ago greatly increased the overall food supply which was used to support more people Food production further increased with the \n industrial revolution \n as machinery \n fertilizers \n herbicides \n and \n pesticides \n were used to increase land under cultivation as well as crop yields \n In short similar to \n bacteria \n that multiply in response to increased food supply humans have increased their population as soon as food became more abundant as a result of technological innovations \n Significant increases in human population occur whenever the \n birth rate \n exceeds the \n death rate \n for extended periods of time Traditionally the fertility rate is strongly influenced by cultural and social norms that are rather stable and therefore slow to adapt to changes in the social technological or environmental conditions For example when death rates fell during the 19th and 20th century as a result of improved sanitation child immunizations and other advances in medicine allowing more newborns to survive the fertility rate did not adjust downward fast enough resulting in significant population growth Prior to these changes seven out of ten children died before reaching reproductive age while today about 95% of newborns in industrialized nations reach adulthood \n Agriculture and mining \n This section needs expansion \n You can help by \n adding to it \n February \n Agriculture \n has been the main factor behind human population growth This dates back to prehistoric times when agricultural methods were first developed and continues to the present day with fertilizers agrochemicals large-scale mechanization genetic manipulation and other technologies \n Humans have always \n exploited the environment \n using the easiest most accessible resources first The richest farmland was plowed and the richest mineral ore mined first Overpopulation will demand ever more creative means in which to satisfy these basic human needs \n Psychological factors \n This section \n does not \n cite \n any \n sources \n Please help \n improve

calamities such as disaster or war take on a \n multiplier effect \n For example the \n AIDS crisis in Africa \n is said to have killed million to date yet during the last two decades money and

was roughly million today it is over million million more than if the HIV/AIDS crisis had never occurred \n Extremes \n Population growth rates between and range from a 5% increase in the case of Bulgaria to a more than fold increase for the United Arab Emirates from to million \n Roughly half of all nations have quadrupled their populations since \n Demographic transition \n Main articles \n Demographic transition \n and \n Sub-replacement fertility \n The theory of demographic transition held that after the \n standard of living \n and \n life expectancy \n increase \n family sizes \n and \n birth rates \n decline However as new data has become available it has been observed that after a certain level of development \n HDI \n equal to or higher the fertility increases again \n This means that both the worry that the theory generated about aging populations and the complacency it bred regarding the future environmental impact of population growth are misguided \n Factors cited in the old theory included such social factors as later ages of marriage the growing desire of many women in such settings to seek careers outside \n child rearing \n and domestic work and the decreased need of children in industrialized settings The latter factor stems from the fact that children \n perform a great deal of work \n in small-scale agricultural societies and work less in industrial ones it has been cited to explain the decline in birth rates in industrializing regions \n Many countries have high population growth rates but lower \n total fertility rates \n because high population growth in the past skewed the age demographic toward a young age so the population still rises as the more numerous younger generation approaches maturity \n original research? \n citation needed \n \"Demographic entrapment\" is a concept developed by Maurice King Honorary Research Fellow at the \n University of Leeds \n who posits that this phenomenon occurs when a country has a population larger than its carrying capacity no possibility of migration and exports too little to be able to import food This will cause starvation He claims that for example many sub-Saharan nations are or will become stuck in demographic entrapment instead of having a demographic transition \n For the world as a whole the number of \n children born per woman \n decreased from to between and A

North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa would then have numbers greater than \n Carrying capacity \n Carrying capacity \n A \n family planning \n placard in \n Ethiopia \n It shows some negative effects of having too many children \n Some groups for example the \n World Wide Fund for Nature \n and \n Global Footprint Network \n have stated that the carrying capacity for the human population has been exceeded as measured using the \n Ecological Footprint \n In \n WWF \n 's \" \n Living Planet Report \n \" stated that in order for all humans to live with the current consumption patterns of Europeans we would be spending three times more than what the planet can renew \n Humanity as a whole was using by percent more than what Earth can regenerate \n However \n Roger Martin \n of \n Population Matters \n states the view \"the poor want to get rich and I want them to get rich \" with a later addition \"of course we have to change consumption habits but we've also got to stabilise our numbers\" \n Another study by the World Wildlife Fund in found that it would take the equivalent of Earths of biocapacity to meet humanity's current levels of consumption \n But critics question the simplifications and statistical methods used in calculating Ecological Footprints Therefore Global Footprint Network and its partner organizations have engaged with national governments and international agencies to test the results reviews have been produced by France Germany the European Commission Switzerland Luxembourg Japan and the United Arab Emirates \n Some point out that a more refined method of assessing Ecological Footprint is to designate sustainable versus non-sustainable categories of consumption \n However if yield estimates were adjusted for sustainable levels of production the yield figures would be lower and hence the \n overshoot \n estimated by the Ecological Footprint method even higher \n Other studies give particular attention to \n resource depletion \n and increased world affluence \n further explanation needed \n In a study titled \n Food Land Population and the U S Economy \n David Pimentel \n and \n Mario Giampietro \n estimated the maximum \n U S population \n for a \n sustainable economy \n at million \n And in order to achieve a sustainable economy and avert disaster the United States would have to reduce its population by at least one-third and \n world population \n would have to be reduced by two-thirds \n Many quantitative studies have estimated the world's carrying capacity for humans that is a limit to the world population \n A meta-analysis of such studies suggests a point estimate of the limit to be billion people while lower and upper meta-bounds for current technology are estimated as and billion people respectively They conclude \"recent predictions of stabilized world population levels for exceed several of our meta-estimates of a world population limit\" \n Effects of human overpopulation \n Human impact on the environment \n Humanity's overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors besides raw population The lifestyle including overall affluence and resource utilization and the pollution including \n carbon footprint \n are equally important In \n The New York Times \n stated that the inhabitants of the developed nations of the world consume resources like oil and metals at a rate almost times greater than those of the developing world who make up the majority of the human population \n Some problems associated with or exacerbated by human overpopulation and over-consumption are \n Inadequate fresh water \n for \n drinking \n as well as \n sewage treatment \n and \n effluent \n discharge Some countries like \n Saudi Arabia \n use energy-expensive \n desalination \n to solve the problem of water shortages \n Depletion of natural resources especially \n fossil fuels \n World energy consumption & predictions \n Increased levels of air pollution \n water pollution \n soil contamination \n and \n noise pollution \n Once a country has industrialized and become wealthy a combination of government regulation and technological innovation causes pollution to decline substantially even as the population continues to grow \n Deforestation and loss of ecosystems \n that valuably contribute to the global atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide balance about eight million hectares of forest are lost each year \n Changes in atmospheric composition and consequent \n global warming \n Loss of \n arable land \n and increase in \n desertification \n Deforestation and desertification can be reversed by adopting property rights and this policy is successful even while the human population continues to grow \n Mass species extinctions \n and contracting \n biodiversity \n from reduced habitat in \n tropical forests \n due to \n slash-and-burn \n techniques that sometimes are practiced by \n shifting cultivators \n especially in countries with rapidly expanding rural populations present \n extinction \n rates may be as high as \n species \n lost per year \n As of February the \n IUCN Red List \n lists a total of animal species having gone extinct during recorded human history \n although the vast majority of extinctions are thought to be undocumented \n Biodiversity would continue to grow at an exponential rate if not for human influence \n Sir \n David King \n former chief scientific adviser to the UK government told a parliamentary inquiry \"It is self-evident that the massive growth in the \n human population \n through the 20th century has had more impact on biodiversity than any other single factor \" \n Ehrlich from Stanford said population growth is one of the main drivers of the Earth's extinction crisis \n The \n Yangtze River dolphin \n Atlantic gray whale \n West African black rhino \n Merriam's elk \n California grizzly bear \n silver trout \n blue pike \n and \n dusky seaside sparrow \n are all victims of human overpopulation \n Chris Hedges \n High infant and child mortality \n High rates of infant mortality are associated with poverty Rich countries with high population densities have low rates of infant mortality \n Intensive \n factory farming \n to support large populations It results in human threats including the evolution and spread of \n antibiotic resistant bacteria \n diseases excessive air and water pollution and new viruses that infect humans \n citation needed \n Increased chance of the emergence of new \n epidemics \n and \n pandemics \n For many environmental and social reasons including overcrowded living conditions \n malnutrition \n and inadequate inaccessible or non-existent health care the poor are more likely to be exposed to \n infectious diseases \n Starvation \n malnutrition \n or poor diet with ill health and diet-deficiency diseases e g \n rickets \n However rich countries with high population densities do not have famine \n Poverty coupled with inflation in some regions and a resulting low level of capital formation Poverty and inflation are aggravated by bad government and bad economic policies Many countries with high population densities have eliminated absolute poverty and keep their inflation rates very low \n Low \n life expectancy \n in countries with fastest growing populations \n Unhygienic living conditions for many based upon water resource depletion discharge of raw sewage \n and solid waste disposal However this problem can be reduced with the adoption of sewers For example after \n Karachi Pakistan \n installed sewers its infant mortality rate fell substantially \n Elevated crime rate due to drug cartels and increased theft by people stealing resources to survive \n Conflict over scarce resources and crowding leading to increased levels of warfare \n Less personal freedom and more restrictive laws Laws regulate interactions between humans Law \"serves as a primary social mediator of relations between people\" \n citation needed \n The higher the population density the more frequent such interactions become and thus there develops a need for more laws and/or more restrictive laws to regulate these interactions It was even speculated by \n Aldous Huxley \n in that democracy is threatened due to overpopulation and could give rise to \n totalitarian \n style governments \n David Attenborough \n described the level of human population on the planet as a multiplier of all other environmental problems \n In he described humanity as \"a plague on the Earth\" that needs to be controlled by limiting population growth \n Rich western countries are now siphoning up the planets resources and destroying its ecosystems at an unprecedented rate We want to build highways across the Serengeti to get more rare earth minerals for our cellphones We grab all the fish from the sea wreck the coral reefs and put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere We have triggered a major extinction event A world population of around a billion would have an overall pro-life effect This could be supported for many millennia and sustain many more human lives in the long term compared with our current uncontrolled growth and prospect of sudden collapse If everyone consumed resources at the US level which is what the world aspires to you will need another four or five Earths We are wrecking our planets \n life support systems \n Paul R Ehrlich \n Many of these problems are explored in the dystopic science fiction film \n Soylent Green \n where an overpopulated Earth suffers from food shortages depleted resources and poverty and in the documentary \" \n Aftermath Population Overload \n \" \n Some economists such as \n Thomas Sowell \n and \n Walter E Williams \n argue that third world poverty and \n famine \n are caused in part by bad government and bad economic policies Most biologists and sociologists see overpopulation as a serious threat to the quality of human life \n Some \n deep ecologists \n such as the radical thinker and polemicist \n Pentti Linkola \n see human overpopulation as a threat to the entire \n biosphere \n Resources \n Overpopulation does not depend only on the size or density of the population but on the ratio of population to available sustainable resources It also depends on how resources are managed and distributed throughout the population \n The resources to be considered when evaluating whether an ecological niche is overpopulated include \n clean water \n clean air food shelter warmth and other resources necessary to sustain life If the quality of human life is addressed there may be additional resources considered such as medical care education proper \n sewage treatment \n waste disposal \n and energy supplies Overpopulation places competitive stress on the basic life sustaining resources \n leading to a diminished quality of life \n Directly related to maintaining the health of the human population is water supply and it is one of the resources that experience the biggest strain With the global population at about billion and each human theoretically needing liters of drinking water there is a demand for billion liters of water each day to meet the minimum requirement for healthy living United Weather patterns elevation and climate all contribute to uneven distribution of fresh drinking water Without clean water good health is not a viable option Besides drinking water is used to create sanitary living conditions and is the basis of creating a healthy environment fit to hold human life In addition to drinking water water is also used for bathing washing clothes and dishes flushing toilets a variety of cleaning methods recreation watering lawns and farm irrigation Irrigation poses one of the largest problems because without sufficient water to irrigate crops the crops die and then there is the problem of food rations and starvation In addition to water needed for crops and food there is limited land area dedicated to food production and not much more that is suitable to be added Arable land needed to sustain the growing population is also a factor because land being under or over cultivated easily upsets the delicate balance of nutrition supply There are also problems with location of arable land with regard to proximity to countries and relative population Bashford Access to nutrition is an important limiting factor in population sustainability and growth No increase in arable land added to the still increasing human population will eventually pose a serious conflict Only 38% of the land area of the globe is dedicated to agriculture and there is not room for much more Although plants produce billion metric tons of carbohydrates per year when the population is expected to grow to billion by the plants may not be able to keep up Biello Food supply is a primary example of how a resource reacts when its carrying capacity is exceeded By trying to grow more and more crops off of the same amount of land the soil becomes exhausted Because the soil is exhausted it is then unable to produce the same amount of food as before and is overall less productive Therefore by using resources beyond a sustainable level the resource become nullified and ineffective which further increases the disparity between the demand for a resource and the availability of a resource There must be a shift to provide adequate recovery time to each one of the supplies in demand to support contemporary human lifestyles \n An industrial area with a power plant south of \n Yangzhou \n 's downtown \n China \n David Pimentel \n has stated that \"With the imbalance growing between population numbers and vital life sustaining resources humans must actively conserve cropland freshwater energy and biological resources There is a need to develop renewable energy resources Humans everywhere must understand that rapid population growth damages the Earth's resources and diminishes human well-being \" \n These reflect the comments also of the \n United States Geological Survey \n in their paper \n The Future of Planet Earth Scientific Challenges in the Coming Century \n \"As the global population continues to grow people will place greater and greater demands on the resources of our planet including mineral and \n energy resources \n open space \n water \n and plant and animal resources \" \"Earth's natural wealth an audit\" by \n New Scientist \n magazine states that many of the minerals that we use for a variety of products are in danger of running out in the near future \n A handful of geologists around the world have calculated the costs of new technologies in terms of the materials they use and the implications of their spreading to the developing world All agree that the planet's booming population and rising standards of living are set to put unprecedented demands on the materials that only Earth itself can provide \n Limitations on how much of these materials is available could even mean that some technologies are not worth pursuing long term \"Virgin stocks of several metals appear inadequate to sustain the modern 'developed world' quality of life for all of Earth's people under contemporary technology\" \n On the other hand some \n cornucopian \n researchers such as \n Julian L Simon \n and \n Bjrn Lomborg \n believe that resources exist for further population growth In a study they concluded that \"there are not and will never be too many people for the planet to feed\" according to \n The Independent \n Some critics warn this will be at a high cost to the Earth \"the technological optimists are probably correct in claiming that overall world food production can be increased substantially over the next few decades however the environmental cost of what Paul R and Anne H Ehrlich describe as 'turning the Earth into a giant human feedlot' could be severe A large expansion of agriculture to provide growing populations with improved diets is likely to lead to further \n deforestation \n loss of \n species \n soil erosion \n and pollution from pesticides and fertilizer runoff as farming intensifies and new land is brought into production \" \n Since we are intimately dependent upon the living systems of the Earth \n some scientists have questioned the wisdom of further expansion \n According to the \n Millennium Ecosystem Assessment \n a four-year research effort by of the world's prominent scientists commissioned to measure the actual value of natural resources to humans and the world \"The structure of the world's ecosystems changed more rapidly in the second half of the twentieth century than at any time in recorded human history and virtually all of Earth's ecosystems have now been significantly transformed through human actions \" \n \"Ecosystem services particularly food production timber and fisheries are important for employment and economic activity Intensive use of ecosystems often produces the greatest short-term advantage but excessive and unsustainable use can lead to losses in the long term A country could cut its forests and deplete its fisheries and this would show only as a positive gain to GDP despite the loss of capital assets If the full economic value of ecosystems were taken into account in decision-making their degradation could be significantly slowed down or even reversed \" \n Another study by the \n United Nations Environment Programme \n UNEP called the \n Global Environment Outlook \n which involved scientists and took five years to prepare comes to similar conclusions It \"found that human consumption had far outstripped available resources Each person on Earth now requires a third more land to supply his or her needs than the planet can supply \" \n pageneeded \n It faults a failure to \"respond to or recognize the magnitude of the challenges facing the people and the environment of

affect the vested interests of powerful groups and that the environment must be moved to the core of decision-making ' \n pageneeded \n Although all resources whether mineral or other are limited on the planet there is a degree of self-correction whenever a scarcity or high-demand for a particular kind is experienced For example in known reserves of many natural resources were higher and their prices lower than in despite higher demand and higher consumption Whenever a price spike would occur the market tended to correct itself whether by substituting an equivalent resource or switching to a new technology \n Fresh water \n Further information \n Water crisis \n Fresh water \n supplies on which agriculture depends are running low worldwide \n This \n water crisis \n is only expected to worsen as the population increases \n Potential problems with dependence on desalination are reviewed below however the majority of the world's freshwater supply is contained in the polar icecaps and underground river systems accessible through springs and wells \n Fresh water can be obtained from salt water by \n desalination \n For example \n Malta \n derives two thirds of its freshwater by desalination A number of \n nuclear powered \n desalination plants exist \n However the high costs of desalination especially for poor countries make impractical the transport of large amounts of desalinated seawater to interiors of large countries \n The cost of desalination varies \n Israel \n is now desalinating water for a cost of cents per cubic meter \n Singapore \n at cents per cubic meter \n In the United States the cost is cents per cubic meter $3 for gallons \n According to a study by Zhou and Tol \"one needs to lift the water by m or transport it over more than 1600km to get transport costs equal to the desalination costs Desalinated water is expensive in places that are both somewhat far from the sea and somewhat high such as \n Riyadh \n and \n Harare \n In other places the dominant cost is desalination not transport This leads to somewhat lower costs in places like Beijing \n Bangkok \n Zaragoza \n Phoenix \n and of course coastal cities like \n Tripoli \n \" Thus while the study is generally positive about the technology for affluent areas that are proximate to oceans it concludes that \"Desalinated water may be a solution for some water-stress regions but not for places that are poor deep in the interior of a continent or at high elevation Unfortunately that includes some of the places with biggest water problems \" \n Another potential problem with desalination is the byproduction of saline \n brine \n which can be a major cause of marine pollution when dumped back into the oceans at high temperatures \" \n The world's largest desalination plant is the \n Jebel Ali \n Desalination Plant Phase in the \n United Arab Emirates \n which can produce million cubic metres of water per year \n or about gallons per second The largest desalination plant in the US is the one at \n Tampa Bay \n Florida which began desalinating million gallons m of water per day in December A January article in the \n Wall Street Journal \n states \"Worldwide desalination plants produce more than billion gallons of water a day according to the International Desalination Association \" \n After being desalinated at \n Jubail \n Saudi Arabia water is pumped miles 320km inland though a pipeline to the capital city of \n Riyadh \n However new data originating from the \n GRACE \n experiments and isotopic testing done by the \n IAEA \n show that the \n Nubian aquifer \n which is under the largest driest part of the earth's surface has enough water in it to provide for \"at least several centuries\" In addition to this new and highly detailed maps of the earth's underground reservoirs will be soon created from these technologies that will further allow proper budgeting of cheap water \n Food \n Some scientists argue that there is enough food to support the world population \n and some dispute this particularly if sustainability is taken into account \n Many countries rely heavily on imports \n Egypt \n and \n Iran \n rely on imports for 40% of their grain supply \n Yemen \n and \n Israel \n import more than 90% And just countries \n Argentina \n Australia Canada France \n Thailand \n and the USA supply 90% of grain exports In recent decades the US alone supplied almost half of world grain exports \n A United Nations report says population growth is \"the main force driving increases in agricultural demand\" but \"most recent expert assessments are cautiously optimistic about the ability of global food production to keep up with demand for the foreseeable future that is to say until approximately or \" assuming declining population growth rates \n However the observed figures for show an actual increase in absolute numbers of undernourished people in the world million in versus million in \n the more recent FAO estimates point to an even more dramatic increase to billion in \n Global perspective \n Further information \n world food price crisis \n Growth in food production has been greater than population growth \n The amounts of natural resources in this context are not necessarily fixed and their distribution is not necessarily a \n zero-sum game \n For example due to the \n Green Revolution \n and the fact that more and more land is appropriated each year from wild lands for agricultural purposes the worldwide production of food had steadily increased up until World food production per person was considerably higher in than \n As world population doubled from billion to billion daily \n calorie \n consumption in poor countries increased from to and the percentage of people in those countries who were malnourished fell from 45% to 18% This suggests that Third World poverty and famine are caused by underdevelopment not overpopulation \n However others question these statistics \n From to as the \n Green Revolution \n transformed agriculture around the world grain production increased by over 250% \n The world population has grown by about four billion since the beginning of the Green Revolution and most believe that without the Revolution there would be greater \n famine \n and \n malnutrition \n than the UN presently documents \n The number of \n people who are overweight \n has surpassed the number who are undernourished In a news story \n MSNBC \n reported \"There are an estimated million undernourished people and more than a billion considered overweight worldwide \" The U S has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world \n However studies show that wealthy and educated people are far likelier to eat healthy food \n indicating obesity is a disease related to poverty and lack of education and excessive advertising of unhealthy eatables at cheaper cost high in calories with little nutritive value are consumed \n Percentage of population suffering from malnutrition by country according to United Nations statistics \n The \n Food and Agriculture Organization \n of the United Nations states in its report \n The State of Food Insecurity in the World \n that while the number of undernourished people in the developing countries has declined by about three million a smaller proportion of the populations of developing countries is undernourished today than in 17% against 20% Furthermore FAO's projections suggest that the proportion of hungry people in developing countries could be halved from levels to 10% by The FAO also states \"We have emphasized first and foremost that reducing hunger is no longer a question of means in the hands of the global community The world is richer today than it was ten years ago There is more food available and still more could be produced without excessive upward pressure on prices The knowledge and resources to reduce hunger are there What is lacking is sufficient political will to

anthropologist \n Peter Farb \n journalist \n Richard Manning \n environmental biologist Alan D Thornhill \n cultural critic and writer \n Daniel Quinn \n and \n anarcho-primitivist \n John Zerzan \n propose that like all other animal populations human populations predictably grow and shrink according to their available food supply growing during an abundance of food and shrinking in times of scarcity \n Proponents of this theory argue that every time food production is increased the population grows Most human populations throughout history validate this theory as does the overall current global population Populations of \n hunter-gatherers \n fluctuate in accordance with the amount of available food The world human population began increasing after the \n Neolithic Revolution \n and its increased food supply This was subsequent to the \n Green Revolution \n followed by even more severely accelerated population growth which continues today Often wealthier countries send their surplus food resources to the aid of starving communities however proponents of this theory argue that this seemingly beneficial notion only results in further harm to those communities in the long run Peter Farb for example has commented on the paradox that \"intensification of production to feed an increased population leads to a still greater increase in population \" \n Daniel Quinn has also focused on this phenomenon which he calls the \" \n Food Race \n \" comparable in terms of both escalation and potential catastrophe to the \n nuclear arms race \n Critics of this theory point out that in the modern era birth rates are lowest in the \n developed nations \n which also have the highest access to food In fact some developed countries have both a diminishing population and an abundant food supply The United Nations projects that the population of countries or areas including Germany Italy Japan and most of the states of the former Soviet Union is expected to be lower in than in \n citation needed \n This shows that limited to the scope of the population living within a single given political boundary particular human populations do not always grow to match the available food supply However the global population as a whole still grows in accordance with the total food supply and many of these wealthier countries are major \n exporters \n of food to poorer populations so that \"it is through exports from food-rich to food-poor areas Allaby Pimentel et al that the population growth in these food-poor areas is further fueled \" \n Regardless of criticisms against the theory that population is a function of food availability the \n human population \n is on the global scale undeniably increasing \n as is the net quantity of human food produced a pattern that has been true for roughly years since the human development of agriculture The fact that some affluent countries demonstrate negative population growth fails to discredit the theory as whole since the world has become a \n globalized system \n with food moving across national borders from areas of abundance to areas of scarcity Hopfenberg and Pimentel's findings support both this \n and Quinn's direct accusation that \"First World farmers are fueling the Third World population explosion \" \n Additionally the hypothesis is not so simplistic as to be rejected by any single case study as in Germany's recent population trends clearly other factors are at work to limit the population in wealthier areas \n contraceptive \n access educational programs cultural norms and most influentially differing economic realities from nation to nation \n As a result of water deficits \n Water deficits \n which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries may soon do the same in larger countries such as China or India if technology is not used \n The water tables are falling in scores of countries including Northern China the US and India owing to widespread \n overdrafting \n beyond \n sustainable \n yields \n citation needed \n Other countries affected include Pakistan \n Iran \n and Mexico This overdrafting is already leading to \n water scarcity \n and cutbacks in grain harvest Even with the overpumping of its \n aquifers \n China has developed a grain deficit This effect has contributed in driving grain prices upward Most of the billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing \n water shortages \n Desalination \n is also considered a viable and effective solution to the problem of water shortages \n After China and India there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits \n Algeria \n Egypt \n Iran \n Mexico and Pakistan Four of these already import a large share of their grain Only Pakistan remains self-sufficient But with a population expanding by million a year it will also soon turn to the world market for grain \n Land \n Percentages of the Earth's surface covered by water dedicated to agriculture under conversion intact and used for human habitation While humans ourselves occupy only 05% of the Earth's total area our effects are felt on over one-quarter of the land \n The World Resources Institute states that \"Agricultural conversion to croplands and managed \n pastures \n has affected some billion hectares roughly percent of the land area All totaled agriculture has displaced one-third of \n temperate \n and \n tropical forests \n and one-quarter of natural grasslands \" \n Forty percent of the land area is under conversion and fragmented less than one quarter primarily in the Arctic and the deserts remains intact \n Usable land may become less useful through \n salinization \n deforestation \n desertification \n erosion \n and \n urban sprawl \n Global warming \n may cause flooding of many of the most productive agricultural areas \n The development of energy sources may also require large areas for example the building of \n hydroelectric dams \n Thus available useful land may become a limiting factor By most estimates at least half of cultivable land is already being farmed and there are concerns that the remaining reserves are greatly overestimated \n High \n crop yield \n vegetables like potatoes and lettuce \n citation needed \n use less space on inedible plant parts like stalks husks vines and inedible leaves New varieties of selectively bred and \n hybrid \n plants have larger edible parts fruit vegetable grain and smaller inedible parts however many of these gain of agricultural technology are now historic and new advances are more difficult to achieve With new technologies it is possible to grow crops on some marginal land under certain conditions \n Aquaculture \n could theoretically increase available area \n Hydroponics \n and food from bacteria and fungi like \n quorn \n may allow the growing of food without having to consider land quality climate or even available sunlight although such a process may be very energy-intensive Some argue that not all arable land will remain productive if used for agriculture because some \n marginal land \n can only be made to produce food by unsustainable practices like \n slash-and-burn \n agriculture Even with the modern techniques of agriculture the sustainability of production is in question \n Some countries such as the \n United Arab Emirates \n and particularly the Emirate of \n Dubai \n have constructed large artificial islands or have created large dam and dike systems like the Netherlands which \n reclaim land \n from the sea to increase their total land area \n Some scientists have said that in the future densely populated cities will use \n vertical farming \n to grow food inside skyscrapers \n The notion that space is limited has been decried by skeptics who point out that the Earth's population of roughly billion people could comfortably be housed an area comparable in size to the state of Texas in the United States about square miles or square kilometres \n However the impact of humanity extends over a far greater area than that required simply for housing \n Fossil fuels \n Peak oil \n M King Hubbert \n 's prediction of world petroleum production rates Modern agriculture is totally reliant on petroleum energy \n Population optimists have been criticized for failing to take into account the depletion of the petroleum required for the production of \n fertilizers \n and fuel for transportation as well as other \n fossil fuels \n In his book \n Earth in the Balance \n Al Gore \n wrote \" it ought to be possible to establish a coordinated global program to accomplish the strategic goal of completely eliminating the internal combustion engine over say a twenty-five-year period \" \n Approximately half of the oil produced in the United States is refined into gasoline for use in internal combustion engines \n The report \n Peaking of World Oil Production Impacts

Report \n of states \"During the last years more than developing countries and several Eastern European countries have suffered from disastrous growth failures The reductions in \n standard of living

below the level that was reached or years ago\" Similarly although the proportion of \"starving\" people in \n sub-Saharan Africa \n has decreased the absolute number of starving people has increased due to population growth The percentage dropped from 38% in to 33% in and was expected to be 30% by \n But the region's population roughly doubled between and To keep the numbers of starving constant the percentage would have dropped by more than half \n Graph of \n Total Fertility Rate \n vs \n GDP PPP per capita of the corresponding country \n As of there were countries in the world with more than five million people All of these in which women have on the average more than children in their lifetime have a per capita GDP of less than $5000 Only in two countries with per capita GDP above ~$15 do women have on the average more than children in their lifetime these are Israel and Saudi Arabia with average lifetime births per woman between and \n As their income increases women are \n liberated \n and tend to have fewer \"quantity kids\" as in two in place of six \n The correlation does not imply cause and effect and can be linked to the interplay of birth rates death rates and economic development \n Poor living conditions can also cause a very bad effect on the population diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS can also contribute to this Lack of nutrients poor sanitation and poor health institutions Death rate and birth rate can also have a negative effect on the population \n Environment \n You know when we first set up WWF our objective was to save endangered

Environmental author \n Jeremy Rifkin \n has said that \"our burgeoning population and urban way of life have been purchased at the expense of vast ecosystems and habitats It's no accident that as we celebrate the urbanization of the world we are quickly approaching another historic watershed the disappearance of the wild \" \n Says Peter Raven former President of the \n American Association for the Advancement of Science \n AAAS in their seminal work \n AAAS Atlas of Population & Environment \n \"Where do we stand in our efforts to achieve a sustainable world? Clearly the past half century has been a traumatic one as the collective impact of human numbers affluence consumption per individual and our choices of technology continue to exploit rapidly an increasing proportion of the world's resources at an unsustainable rate During a remarkably short period of time we have lost a quarter of the world's \n topsoil \n and a fifth of its agricultural land altered the composition of the \n atmosphere \n profoundly and destroyed a major proportion of our forests and other natural \n habitats \n without replacing them Worst of all we have driven the rate of biological \n extinction \n the permanent loss of species up several hundred times beyond its historical levels and are threatened with the loss of a majority of all species by the end of the 21st century \" \n Traffic congestion in \n Ho Chi Minh City \n Vietnam \n Further even in countries which have both large population growth and major ecological problems it is not necessarily true that curbing the population growth will make a major contribution towards resolving all environmental problems \n However as developing countries with high populations become more industrialized pollution and consumption will invariably increase \n The \n Worldwatch Institute \n said in that the booming economies of \n China \n and India are \"planetary powers that are shaping the global biosphere\" The report states \n The world's ecological capacity is simply insufficient to satisfy the ambitions of China India Japan Europe and the United States as well as the aspirations of the rest of the world in a sustainable way \n According to \n Worldwatch Institute \n if China and India were to consume as much resources per capita as the United States in they would each require a full planet Earth to meet their needs \n In the long term these effects can lead to increased conflict over dwindling resources \n and in the worst case a \n Malthusian catastrophe \n Many studies link population growth with \n emissions \n and the effect of \n climate change \n Warfare and conflict \n excessive growth may reduce output per worker repress levels of living for the masses and engender strife \n Confucius \n BC \n Overpopulation in various countries has become a serious threat to the health of people and a grave obstacle to any attempt to organize peace on this planet \n Albert Einstein \n physicist \n It has been suggested \n that overpopulation leads to increased levels of tensions both between and within countries Modern usage of the term \n \"lebensraum\" \n supports the idea that overpopulation may promote warfare through fear of resource scarcity and increasing numbers of youth lacking the opportunity to engage in peaceful employment the \n youth bulge theory \n Criticism of this hypothesis \n The \n hypothesis \n that population pressure causes increased \n warfare \n has been recently criticized on the empirical grounds Both studies focusing on specific historical societies and analyses of cross-cultural data have failed to find positive correlation between population density and incidence of warfare \n Andrey Korotayev \n in collaboration with \n Peter Turchin \n has shown that such negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis \n Population and warfare are dynamical variables and if their interaction causes sustained oscillations then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time that is unlagged Korotayev and Turchin have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare focusing on internal warfare might be in both stateless and state societies Next they have tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies early modern England \n Han \n and \n Tang \n China and the \n Roman Empire \n Their empirical results have supported the population-warfare theory that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in phase with warfare peaks following population peaks \n Furthermore they have demonstrated that in the agrarian societies the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density \n Proposed solutions and mitigation measures \n Given the current levels of violence by this culture against both humans and the natural world however it's not possible to speak of reductions in population and consumption that do not involve violence and privation not because the reductions themselves would necessarily involve violence but because violence and privation have become the default of our culture \n Derrick Jensen \n Endgame \n There are several solutions and mitigation measures that have the potential to reduce overpopulation Some solutions are to be applied on a global planetary level e g via \n UN \n resolutions some to be applied on a local government state city or other organization level and some are to be applied on a family or an individual level Some of the mitigations are ways to implement social norms Overpopulation is an issue that threatens the state of the environment and therefore societies must make a change in order to reverse some of the environmental effects brought on by current social norms \n For example in societies like China the government has put policies in place that regulate the number of children allowed to a couple Other societies have already begun to implement social marketing strategies in order to educate the public on overpopulation effects \"The intervention can be widespread and done at a low cost A variety of print materials flyers brochures fact sheets stickers needs to be produced and distributed throughout the communities such as at local places of worship sporting events local food markets schools and at car parks taxis / bus stands \" \n Such prompts work to introduce the problem so that social norms are easier to implement Certain government policies are making it easier and more socially acceptable to use contraception and abortion methods An example of a country whose laws and norms are hindering the global effort to slow population growth is Afghanistan \"The approval by Afghan President Hamid Karzai of the Shia Personal Status Law in March effectively destroyed Shia women's rights and freedoms in Afghanistan Under this law women have no right to deny their husbands sex unless they are ill and can be denied food if they do \" \n Education and empowerment \n One option is to focus on education about overpopulation \n family planning \n and \n birth control \n methods and to make birth-control devices like male and \n female \n condoms \n pills \n and \n intrauterine devices \n easily available Worldwide nearly 40% of \n pregnancies are unintended \n some million unintended pregnancies each year \n An estimated million women in the poorest countries of the world either did not want their last child do not want another child or want to space their pregnancies but they lack access to information affordable means and services to determine the size and spacing of their families In the United States in almost half of \n pregnancies were unintended \n In the \n developing world \n some women die annually of complications from pregnancy and abortion \n with 86% of these deaths occurring in the \n sub-Saharan Africa \n region and South Asia \n Additionally million infants die many because of \n malnutrition \n or preventable diseases especially from lack of access to clean drinking water \n Women's rights \n and their \n reproductive rights \n in particular are issues regarded to have vital importance in the debate \n \"The only ray of hope I can see and it's not much is that wherever women are put in control of their lives both politically and socially where medical facilities allow them to deal with birth control and where their husbands allow them to make those decisions birth rate falls Women don't want to have kids of whom nine will die \" \n DavidAttenborough \n Egypt \n announced a program to reduce its overpopulation by family planning education and putting \n women in the workforce \n It was announced in June by the Minister of Health and Population \n Hatem el-Gabali \n The government has set aside million Egyptian pounds about $90 million US for the program \n The business magnate \n Ted Turner \n proposed a \"voluntary non-imposed\" one-child family scenario A \" \n pledge two or fewer \n \" campaign is run by \n Population Matters \n a UK population concern organisation in which people are encouraged to limit themselves to small family size \n Birth regulations \n Overpopulation issue can be mitigated by \n birth control \n some nations like the People's Republic of China use strict measures to reduce birth rates Religious and ideological opposition to birth control has been cited as a factor contributing to overpopulation and poverty \n Sanjay Gandhi \n son of late Prime Minister of India \n Indira Gandhi \n implemented a forced \n sterilization \n programme between and Officially men with two children or more had to submit to sterilization but there was a greater focus on sterilizing women than sterilizing men Some unmarried young men political opponents and ignorant men were also believed to have been sterilized \n citation needed \n This program is still remembered and criticized in India and is blamed for creating a public aversion to \n family planning \n which hampered government programmes for decades \n Urban designer \n Michael E Arth \n has proposed a \"choice-based marketable birth license plan\" he calls \" \n birth credits \n \" \n Birth credits would allow any woman to have as many children as she wants as long as she buys a license for any children beyond an average allotment that would result in \n zero population growth \n If that allotment was determined to be one child for example then the first child would be free and the market would determine what the license fee for each additional child would cost Extra credits would expire after a certain time so these credits could not be hoarded by speculators The actual cost of the credits would only be a fraction of the actual \n cost of having and raising a child \n so the credits would serve more as a wake-up call to women who might otherwise produce children without seriously considering the long term consequences to themselves or society \n Another choice-based approach similar to Arth's birth credits is financial compensation or other benefits free goods and/or services by the state or state-owned companies offered to people who voluntarily undergo \n sterilization \n Such compensation has been offered in the past by the government of India \n In the United Nations estimated there is an 80% likelihood that the world's population will be between billion and billion by Most of the world's expected population increase will be in Africa and southern Asia Africa's population is expected to rise from the current one billion to three or four billion by and Asia could add another billion in the same period \n Because the median age of Africans is so low e g \n Uganda \n = years old birth credits would have to limit fertility to one child per two women to reach the levels of developed countries immediately For countries with a wide base in their population pyramid it will take a generation for the people who are of child bearing age to have their families \n An example of \n demographic momentum \n is China which added perhaps more people after its one-child policy was enacted Arth has suggested that the focus should be on the developed countries and that some combination of birth credits and additional compensation supplied by the developed countries could rapidly lead to zero population growth while also quickly raising the standard of living in developing countries \n Infectious agents \n There are also natural diseases such as \n chlamydia \n gonorrhea \n and even some diseases that produce no physical discomfort at all such as some specific \n adeno-associated viruses \n that may also cause sterilization of males and/or females in the population \n Whereas the natural occurrence of these diseases is not sufficient to significantly reduce the population problem large-scale production of these diseases and human-induced release of such diseases could quite well be used as a mitigation measure \n citation needed \n Extraterrestrial settlement \n Space colonization \n

\n the attending members reaffirmed their commitment to Agenda21 in their outcome document called \"The Future We Want\" leaders from nations participated \n Implementation \n The \n Commission on Sustainable Development \n acts as a high-level forum on sustainable development and has acted as preparatory committee for summits and sessions on the implementation of Agenda21 The UNDivision for Sustainable Development acts as the secretariat to the Commission and works \"within the context of\" Agenda21 \n Implementation by member states remains voluntary and its adoption has varied \n Local level \n International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives \n The implementation of Agenda21 was intended to involve action at international national regional and local levels Some national and state governments have legislated or advised that local authorities take steps to implement the plan locally as recommended in Chapter28 of the document These programs are often known as \"Local Agenda 21\" or \"LA21\" \n For example in the \n Philippines \n the plan is \"Philippines Agenda21\" PA21 The group ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability formed in today its members come from over 000cities towns and counties in 88countries and is widely regarded as a paragon of Agenda21 implementation \n In other countries \n which? \n opposition to Agenda 21's ideas has surfaced to varied extents In some cases opposition has been legislated into several States limiting or forbidding the participation and/or funding of local government activities that support Agenda \n Europe turned out to be the continent where LA21 was best accepted and most implemented \n In Sweden for example all local governments have implemented a Local Agenda initiative \n National level \n This section needs expansion \n You can help by \n adding to it \n June \n The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs' Division for Sustainable Development monitors and evaluates progress nation by nation towards the adoption of Agenda21 and makes these reports available to the public on its website \n Australia \n for example is a signatory to Agenda21 and of its municipalities subscribe to \n ICLEI \n an organization that promotes Agenda21 globally Australia's membership is second only to that of the United States \n European countries generally possess well documented Agenda21 statuses France whose national government along with 14cities is a signatory boasts nationwide programs supporting Agenda21 The French activist group Nouvelle Force announced in March that they viewed Agenda21 as a \"sham\" \n In Africa national support for Agenda21 is strong and most countries are signatories But support is often closely tied to environmental challenges specific to each country for example in \n Sam Nujoma \n who was then President of \n Namibia \n spoke about the importance of adhering to Agenda21 at the Earth Summit noting that as a \n semi-arid \n country Namibia sets a lot of store in the \n United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification \n UNCCD \n Furthermore there is little mention of Agenda21 at the local level in indigenous media Only major municipalities in \n sub-Saharan African \n countries are members of ICLEI Agenda21 participation in \n North African \n countries mirrors that of \n Middle Eastern \n countries with most countries being signatories but little to no adoption on the local-government level Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa generally have poorly documented Agenda21 status reports \n citation needed \n By contrast \n South Africa \n 's participation in Agenda21 mirrors that of modern Europe with 21city members of ICLEI and support of Agenda21 by national-level government \n citation needed \n Specific countries \n This section needs expansion \n You can help by \n adding to it \n May \n United States \n The national focal point in the United States is the Division Chief for Sustainable Development and Multilateral Affairs Office of Environmental Policy \n Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs \n U S Department of State \n A June poll of United States voters by the \n American Planning Association \n found that 9% supported Agenda 6% opposed it and 85% thought they didn't have enough information to form an opinion \n Support \n The United States is a signatory country to Agenda21 but because Agenda21 is a legally non-binding statement of intent and not a treaty the \n United States Senate \n did not hold a formal debate or vote on it It is therefore not considered to be law under \n Article Six of the United States Constitution \n President \n George H W Bush \n was one of the heads of government who signed the final text of the agreement at the Earth Summit in \n and in the same year Representatives \n Nancy Pelosi \n Eliot Engel \n and \n William Broomfield \n spoke in support of \n United States House of Representatives \n Concurrent Resolution supporting implementation of Agenda21 in the United States \n Created by a Executive Order the President's Council on Sustainable Development PCSD is explicitly charged with recommending a national action plan for sustainable development to the President The PCSD is composed of leaders from government and industry as well as from environmental labor and civil rights organizations The PCSD submitted its report \"Sustainable America A New Consensus\" to the President in early In the absence of a multi-sectoral consensus on how to achieve sustainable development in the United States the PCSD was conceived to formulate recommendations for the implementation of Agenda \n In the United States over 528cities are members of \n ICLEI \n an international sustainability organization that helps to implement the Agenda21 and Local Agenda21 concepts across the world The United States has nearly half of the ICLEI's global membership of 200cities promoting sustainable development at a local level \n The United States also has one of the most comprehensively documented Agenda21 status reports \n In response to the opposition Don Knapp U S spokesman for the ICLEI has said \"Sustainable development is not a top-down conspiracy from the U N but a bottom-up push from local governments\" \n The \n Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry \n successfully lobbied against an anti-sustainable development bill in arguing \"It would be bad for business\" as it could drive away corporations that have embraced sustainable development \n Opposition \n During the last decade opposition to Agenda21 has increased within the United States at the local state and federal levels \n The \n Republican National Committee \n has adopted a resolution opposing Agenda and the \n Republican Party \n platform stated that \"We strongly reject the U N Agenda as erosive of American sovereignty \" \n Several state and local governments have considered or passed motions and

which emerged in the 1970s that claim to interrogate and challenge the dominant use of \"film\" and \"cinema\" in association with a global big budget \"industry\" DeeDee Halleck noted in her book \n Hand-Held Visions \n that \"It's one thing to critique the mass media and rail against their abuses It's quite another to create viable alternatives \" \n Community film takes up that challenge at a local and global \"transnational\" \n level and further builds on the pioneering work of \n Many Voices One World \n Report undertaken by UNESCO's International Commission for the Study of Communication problems chaired by Sean MacBride and its subsequent deliberations \n Outside the global communications field community film operates within education and community work environments and in another direction as a contribution to the human rights movement and more overtly political campaigning or advocacy work on behalf of individuals and communities \n Debates about community film

Critical comparisons with related fields \n Drawing on other discourses and practices \n Training and development \n Future \n Social and educational roles \n Questions \n Global dimensions and an open world \n Debates about community film \"groups\" and individual self-expression \n Many of the debates which occur in the \"community film\" field as \"theory\" or as \"practice\" can also be observed in discussion of \n cultural studies \n and \n community media \n This article refers to twenty academic writers who have discussed the topic and the broader field of enquiry we \n who? \n aim to outline the common principles that describe the dominant practices that are observed in community film work For a more methodological approach to the process of participatory production that links with development studies the article on \n Participatory video \n and the \"Fogo process\" is recommended \n by whom? \n A useful starting point is to note that community film entails collaborative discourses \n and co-operative approaches \n rather than the primacy of individual self-expression which some critics have stated to be drivers for growth of entertainment-driven social media The kind of cyber-scepticism in Evgeny Morozov's \n The Net Delusion \n appears to be more around social networking and whether it has the genuine potential to change civil and political life The emphasis in some quarters on the value and impact of collaborative creativity or \"mass innovation\" \n is a more productive starting point for the discussion of the future impact of community projects in interactive digital contexts \n The emphasis on community does not entail that the individual does not have a valued role or lose his or her identity The positive dimension suggests that the individual grows by virtue of community interaction At best collaborative film work balances speaking and listening creating and criticizing \n Scoping the field \n Community film need not be understood as a minority interest recent work points to the \n mass-market \n evidence of community filmmaking available on websites such as YouTube and other platforms \n Critical opinion on the \"value\" of Community media such as film is likely to remain divided across the spectrum for political and professional reasons In the past research on community film has also been hampered by the local highly specific and ephemeral nature of the productions or by the sense that the participatory \n process \n was what mattered rather than a lasting \n product \n available for distribution A broader issue for researchers has been that the collective activities of small groups which are loosely organized falls \"under the radar\" in research studies of the third sector civil society \n In other examples such as \"underground\" film making the desire may be to avoid mainstream visibility Others make a virtue of lack of resources available for projects by celebrating film making as \"indie\" \"guerilla\" \"DIY\" \"low budget\" or even \"no-budget \" \n Against amateurs \n In some quarters there has been open hostility to the \n amateur \n aspects of social media In his book \n The Cult of the Amateur \n Andrew Keen asserts that \"Out of this anarchy it suddenly became clear that what was governing the infinite monkeys now inputting away on the Internet was the law of digital Darwinism the survival of the loudest and most opinionated Under these rules the only way to intellectually prevail is by infinite filibustering \" \n Perhaps by insisting on the value of working together \"Community film\" claims to contribute to working against \"undesirable\" tendencies of lone attention-seeking individuals See also the notes on industry skills and professionalization below \n Problems with collaborative approaches to film making \n In \n participatory video \n methodology it is common to work with all participants as equal producers The equal status of collaborators runs risks and has drawbacks that are symptomatic of all collaborative ventures It may be idealistic or impractical for instance to assume that everyone could have an equal contribution throughout the film making process Collective decision making can become intractable and lead to ineffective and temporary compromises There is a continuing problem of how to address a variety of dissenting or minority opinions Collective action may lead to unreconciled positions and a lack of direction or an inability to establish aesthetic coherence \n Mixed forms of collaboration \n In mixed collaboration a leadership role for a curator or director may be created in order to select and piece together a variety of contributions from a wider community An example of Director s assembling and arranging a variety of community-generated films into one cohesive production is Kevin Macdonald and Joseph Michael's \n Life in a Day \n - a documentary film project born out of a partnership between YouTube Ridley Scott Associates and LG electronics \n Community film popular culture and mass media \n Although there is the sense in \"community film\" and \" \n Community media \n \" debates of a critical attitude to \"entertainment\" as unthinking escapism and to \"star culture\" as celebrity some academics have proposed a more defensive or celebratory inclusiveness in critical responses \n Also in popular social media for instance more is being understood about the participatory nature of fan groups even where that interactivity is being shaped top-down by celebrities and their agents \n \"Community film\" draws on the democratic and participatory potential of new technology which has decreased the cost of entry for new film makers new distributors and wider more interactive audiences In the hands of a growing number of activists film has become a tool for community building diversity and resistance \n Taking the argument further the traditional power triangle of film maker-distributor-spectator can also be challenged and opened up On the other hand the public display of filmed protest movements may leave participants open to identification by those who seek to oppress them \n Discursive functions and the problem of representation \n As a global phenomenon \"community film\" claims to respect the integrity and identity of the local community and importantly dialogues between local groups against the perceived homogenization of the dominant transnational industries that seek to erase distinctive voices in order to create their international products and brands In that regard the discourses and practices associated with community film claim to be decolonizing and post-colonial Some academic critics on the other hand have disputed whether documentary and ethnographic film can or ought? to be neutral \n In its storytelling role \"Community film\" runs the risk of being partisan or serving the interests of one group against another Conferences festivals and online platforms provide useful opportunities to discuss issues of fair representation evidence and objectivity In that regard social media helps to critique what would otherwise or in former times have been rather isolated productions \n Organizational practice and methodology \n As an example of organizational practice and methodology \"Community film\" draws on and emphasizes the collaborative nature of film making The focus is on co-operation and teamwork rather than the self the ego the auteur and the hierarchy that dominates mainstream cinema Community film exponents believe that by employing more collectivist approaches than the \"industry\" their work may be liberating for communities and may also develop creativity rather than holding it back Working with young people Steve Goodman has noted that a video camera provides \"a critical lens through which they can explore the world around them It helps them to defamiliarize the familiar taken for granted conditions of life \" \n p \n Sustainability Advocacy and Activism \n Exponents of community film suggest that it encompasses a range of sustainable tools and emerging tool kits for the creative liberation of citizens and the planet Accordingly more political perspectives on \"Community Film\" engage directly with film as a form of advocacy and activism human rights and more broadly \"video for change \" \n Increasingly real or 'authentic' community faces and voices are used in film by organizations wishing to demonstrate evidence for their work or the relevance and significance of the issues presented by the participants \n Against the mainstream \n A survey \n by whom? \n of community films presented at festivals and conferences suggests major differences from traditional notions of \"film\" defined as fictional minutes' duration big budget commercial entertainment market-driven product Accordingly some community films as products of artist-collectives embrace avant-garde experimentation as well as process-driven approaches Like community media community film often sees itself at odds with the dominant modes of top-down celebrity-driven merchandising-dependent and consumption-driven models \n By working on a smaller scale than the global film industry it is claimed \n by whom? \n that \"community film\" combats the specialization and alienation that big-budget films incorporate as a business practice model In \"community film\" as in \n participatory video \n the individual will have the opportunity to undertake a variety of roles and to learn a range of skills Formal qualifications and traditional film industry experience are not required although participants will often be guided initially by those with acquired technical and film project skills \n Community film places a greater emphasis on a willingness to learn to experiment and to take creative risks Another set of approaches can be understood as a development of applied critical theory \n Critical comparisons with related fields \n Community film embraces and celebrates social documentary and political film approaches but does not confine itself to seeking participatory solutions to a specific social problem It differs from participatory video \n methodologies such as the \"Fogo Process\" where the approaches are better understood in terms of social science models of instrumental engagement which are outcome-focussed or more ethnographic visual methodologies Community film appears to be anti-methodological and suspicious of utopian goals or notions of aesthetic perfectibility Websites that promote community film embrace DIY or Do-It-Together approaches the cult of the amateur or the notion of punk Underground or 'Open' Screenings may happen alongside musical and other forms of performance A traditional cinema is not required festivals may also be virtual being presented as online with community volunteers acting as curators or judges \n Drawing on other discourses and practices \n Community film constitutes a broader field than a specific participatory video methodology by incorporating a wider range of community development practices and modes of facilitation Furthermore \"Community film\" learns from related fields such as applied drama \n process drama improvisation theatre for development and creative approaches to education such as preferred learning styles and multiple intelligence \n Training and development \n Any organized group or loose association of individuals coming together to make watch and discuss film constitutes \"community film\" in action Traditional notions of the trained professional crew the film set scripts and acting skills are not essential to the \"community film\" practice The critical attitude to an enshrined professional guild and educational class comes through from the work of \n Ivan Illich \n and more broadly \n Henry Giroux \n and \n Critical pedagogy \n Future \n Similarly examples of current work in the field shows that community film does not require traditional large scale cinema distribution Community film is a movement to occupy screens anywhere and everywhere that the traditional film industry does not have a monopoly But the weaknesses of \n community television \n in many parts of the world and the stranglehold of global commercial satellite providers suggests that community film is a weak force at present However additional channels have sometimes provided opportunities for screening of new video work emerging from the community and non profit sectors of civil society One example is the British \n Community Channel \n In the UK future licences are planned in the field of locally grown TV news current affairs and magazine style programmes \"The Government is committed to decentralising broadcasting to increase localisation \" \n Further advances in the community film field are likely to spring from advances in technology and software such as collaborative editing further exploration of interactivity better understanding and use of wiki-discourses and practices improved bandwidth and infrastructure \n Social and educational roles \n Community film operates on two interlocking levels \n visual/media literacy and \n digital media participation \n In line with the UNESCO McBride deliberations it asserts that these are basic human rights The first implies an ability to interrogate and discuss film and other media rather than to be shaped as a passive consumer of the entertainment industry The second

fuels can be converted into mechanical energy with high efficiency and is clean at the point of consumption \n In addition to that electrification with renewable energy is much more efficient and therefore leads to a significant reduction in primary energy requirements because most renewables don't have a steam cycle with high losses fossil power plants usually have losses of to 65% \n

growth \n and \n geothermal heat \n as the \n International Energy Agency \n explains \n Renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly In its various forms it derives directly from the sun or from heat generated deep within the earth Included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from solar wind ocean \n hydropower \n biomass geothermal resources and biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable resources \n Renewable energy resources and significant opportunities for \n energy efficiency \n exist over wide geographical areas in

public health reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that amount to several hundred billion dollars annually only in the United States \n Renewable energy sources that derive their energy from the sun either directly or indirectly such as hydro and wind are expected to be capable of supplying humanity energy for almost another billion years at which point the predicted increase in heat from the \n sun \n is expected to make the surface of the earth too hot for liquid water to exist \n Climate change \n and \n global warming \n concerns coupled with \n high oil prices \n peak oil \n and increasing government support are driving increasing renewable energy legislation incentives and \n commercialization \n New government spending regulation and policies helped the industry weather the \n global financial crisis \n better than many other sectors \n According to a projection by the \n International Energy Agency \n solar power generators may produce most of the world's electricity within years reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment \n As of small solar PV systems provide electricity to a few million households and micro-hydro configured into mini-grids serves many more Over million households use \n biogas \n made in household-scale digesters for \n lighting \n and/or \n cooking \n and more than million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves \n United Nations \n ' Secretary-General \n Ban Ki-moon \n has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity \n At the national level at least nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond and some countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy including a 20% target of all electricity generated for the European Union by Some countries have much higher long-term policy targets of up to 100% renewables Outside Europe a diverse group of or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the time frame that range from 10% to 50% \n Renewable energy often displaces conventional fuels in four areas \n electricity generation \n hot water \n / \n space heating \n transportation \n and rural off-grid energy services \n Power generation \n By renewable energy is projected to equal coal and natural gas electricity generation Several jurisdictions including Denmark Germany the state of South Australia and some US states have achieved high integration of variable renewables For example in wind power met 42% of electricity demand in Denmark 2% in Portugal and 5% in Uruguay Interconnectors enable countries to balance electricity systems by allowing the import and export of renewable energy Innovative hybrid systems have emerged between countries and regions \n Heating \n Solar water heating \n makes an important contribution to \n renewable heat \n in many countries most notably in China which now has 70% of the global total GWth Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated million households in China Worldwide total installed \n solar water heating \n systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over million households The use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well In Sweden national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil Direct geothermal for heating is also growing rapidly \n The newest addition to Heating is from \n Geothermal Heat Pumps \n which provide both heating and cooling and also flatten the electric demand curve and are thus an increasing national priority \n see also \n Renewable thermal energy \n Transportation \n A bus fueled by \n biodiesel \n Bioethanol \n is an \n alcohol \n made by \n fermentation \n mostly from \n carbohydrates \n produced in \n sugar \n or \n starch \n crops such as \n corn \n sugarcane \n or \n sweet sorghum \n Cellulosic biomass \n derived from non-food sources such as trees and grasses is also being developed as a \n feedstock \n for ethanol production Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form but it is usually used as a \n gasoline \n additive \n to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions Bioethanol is widely used in the \n USA \n and in \n Brazil \n Biodiesel \n can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form but it is usually used as a \n diesel \n additive to reduce levels of particulates \n carbon monoxide \n and \n hydrocarbons \n from diesel-powered vehicles Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using \n transesterification \n and is the most common \n biofuel \n in Europe \n A \n solar vehicle \n is an \n electric vehicle \n powered completely or significantly by direct \n solar energy \n Usually \n photovoltaic \n PV cells contained in \n solar panels \n convert the \n sun \n 's energy directly into \n electric energy \n The term \"solar vehicle\" usually implies that solar energy is used to power all or part of a vehicle's \n propulsion \n Solar power \n may be also used to provide power for communications or controls or other auxiliary functions Solar vehicles are not sold as practical day-to-day transportation devices at present but are primarily demonstration vehicles and engineering exercises often sponsored by government agencies However indirectly solar-charged vehicles are widespread and \n solar boats \n are available commercially \n Prior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century nearly all energy used was renewable Almost without a doubt the oldest known use of renewable energy in the form of traditional biomass to fuel fires dates from years ago Use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later sometime between and years ago \n Probably the second oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water This practice can be traced back some years to ships on the Nile \n Moving into the time of recorded history the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human \n labor \n animal power \n water power \n wind in grain crushing \n windmills \n and \n firewood \n a traditional biomass A graph of energy use in the United States up until shows oil and natural gas with about the same importance in as wind and solar played in \n In the 1860s and '70s there were already fears that civilization would run out of fossil fuels and the need was felt for a better source In Professor \n Augustine Mouchot \n wrote \n The time will arrive when the industry of Europe will cease to find those natural resources so necessary for it Petroleum springs and coal mines are not inexhaustible but are rapidly diminishing in many places Will man then return to the power of water and wind? Or will he emigrate where the most powerful source of heat sends its rays to all? History will show what will come \n In \n Werner von Siemens \n commenting on the discovery of the \n photovoltaic effect \n in the solid state wrote \n In conclusion I would say that however great the scientific importance of this discovery may be its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost and that it will continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten \n Max Weber \n mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs of his \n Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus \n published in \n Development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of World War I The importance of solar energy was recognized in a \n Scientific American \n article \"in the far distant future \n natural fuels \n having been exhausted solar power will remain as the only means of existence of the human race\" \n The theory of \n peak oil \n was published in \n In the 1970s environmentalists promoted the development of renewable energy both as a replacement for the eventual \n depletion of oil \n as well as for an escape from dependence on oil and the first electricity generating \n wind turbines \n appeared Solar had long been used for heating and cooling but solar panels were too costly to build solar farms until \n The IEA World Energy Outlook projects a growth of renewable energy supply from gigawatts in to gigawatts in Fossil fuels received about $550 billion in subsidies in compared to $120 billion for all renewable energies \n Mainstream technologies \n Wind power \n Wind power \n The \n MW \n Shepherds Flat Wind Farm \n near \n Arlington Oregon \n USA \n Airflows can be used to run \n wind turbines \n Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600kW to MW of rated power although turbines with rated output of MW have become the most common for commercial use The largest generator capacity of a single installed onshore wind turbine reached MW in The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed so as wind speed increases power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine \n Areas where winds are stronger and more constant such as offshore and high \n altitude \n sites are preferred locations for wind farms Typically \n full load hours \n of wind turbines vary between and percent annually but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites \n Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in with nearly GW of new wind power capacity installed Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe the US and Canada and the second largest in China In Denmark wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20% \n Globally the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production or times current electricity demand assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas particularly in areas of higher wind resources such as offshore As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land so offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land stationed turbines \n In global wind generation was terawatt-hours or 3% of the worlds total electricity \n Hydropower \n Main articles \n Hydroelectricity \n and \n Hydropower \n The \n Three Gorges Dam \n on the \n Yangtze River \n in China \n In hydropower generated 6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity \n Since water is about times \n denser than air \n even a slow flowing stream of water or moderate sea \n swell \n can yield considerable amounts of energy There are many forms of water energy \n Historically hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and reservoirs which are still popular in third world countries The largest of which is the \n Three Gorges Dam \n in \n China \n and the \n Itaipu Dam \n built by Brazil and Paraguay \n Small hydro \n systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to \n MW \n of power They are often used on small rivers or as a low impact development on larger rivers China is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than small hydro installations \n Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity \n plants derive \n kinetic energy \n from rivers without the creation of a large \n reservoir \n This style of generation may still produce a large amount of electricity such as the \n Chief Joseph Dam \n on the Columbia river in the United States \n Hydropower is produced in countries with the Asia-Pacific region generating percent of global hydropower in For countries having the \n largest percentage \n of electricity from renewables the top are primarily hydroelectric China is the largest hydroelectricity producer with terawatt-hours of production in representing around percent of domestic electricity use There are now three hydroelectricity stations larger than GW the \n Three Gorges Dam \n in China \n Itaipu Dam \n across the Brazil/Paraguay border and \n Guri Dam \n in Venezuela \n Wave power \n which captures the energy of ocean surface waves and \n tidal power \n converting the energy of tides are two forms of hydropower with future potential however they are not yet widely employed commercially A demonstration project operated by the \n Ocean Renewable Power Company \n on the coast of \n Maine \n and connected to the grid harnesses tidal power from the \n Bay of Fundy \n location of world's highest tidal flow \n Ocean thermal energy conversion \n which uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters has currently no economic feasibility \n Solar energy \n Solar energy \n Satellite image of the 550-megawatt \n Topaz Solar Farm \n in California USA \n Solar energy \n radiant \n light \n and \n heat \n from the \n sun \n is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as \n solar heating \n photovoltaics \n concentrated solar power \n CSP \n concentrator photovoltaics \n CPV \n solar architecture \n and \n artificial photosynthesis \n Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either \n passive solar \n or \n active solar \n depending on the way they capture convert and distribute solar energy Passive solar techniques

Solar PV has turned into a multi-billion \n fast-growing \n industry continues to improve its cost-effectiveness and has the most potential of any renewable technologies together with CSP \n Concentrated solar power CSP systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s \n CSP-Stirling \n has by far the highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies \n In the \n International Energy Agency \n said that \"the development of affordable inexhaustible

resource enhance \n sustainability \n reduce pollution lower the costs of mitigating \n climate change \n and keep \n fossil fuel \n prices lower than otherwise These advantages are global Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared\" \n In global solar generation was terawatt-hours slightly less than 1% of the worlds total grid electricity \n Italy has the largest proportion of solar electricity in the world in solar supplied 8% of electricity demand in Italy \n Geothermal energy \n Main articles \n Geothermal energy \n Geothermal electricity \n and \n Renewable thermal energy \n Steam rising from the \n Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station \n in Iceland \n High Temperature Geothermal energy is from \n thermal energy \n generated and stored in the Earth Thermal energy is the energy that determines the \n temperature \n of matter Earth's geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet and from \n radioactive decay \n of minerals in currently uncertain \n but possibly roughly equal \n proportions The \n geothermal gradient \n which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of \n heat \n from the core to the surface The adjective \n geothermal \n originates from the Greek roots \n geo \n meaning earth and \n thermos \n meaning heat \n The heat that is used for geothermal energy can be from deep within the Earth all the way down to Earth's core miles 400km down At the core temperatures may reach over 000F 000C Heat conducts from the core to surrounding rock Extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt which is commonly known as magma Magma convects upward since it is lighter than the solid rock This magma then heats rock and water in the crust sometimes up to 700F 371C \n From \n hot springs \n geothermal energy has been used for bathing since \n Paleolithic \n times and for space heating since ancient Roman times but it is now better known for \n electricity generation \n Low Temperature Geothermal \n refers to the use of the outer crust of the earth as a \n Thermal Battery \n to facilitate \n Renewable thermal energy \n for heating and cooling buildings and other refrigeration and industrial uses In this form of Geothermal a \n Geothermal Heat Pump \n and \n Ground-coupled heat exchanger \n are used together to move heat energy into the earth for cooling and out of the earth for heating on a varying seasonal basis Low temperature Geothermal generally referred to as \"GHP\" is an increasingly important renewable technology because it both reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling and it also flattens the electric demand curve eliminating the extreme summer and winter peak electric supply requirements Thus Low Temperature Geothermal/GHP is becoming an increasing national priority with multiple tax credit support \n and focus as part of the ongoing movement toward Net Zero Energy \n New York City has even just passed a law \n to require GHP anytime is shown to be economical with year financing including the Socialized Cost of Carbon \n Bio energy \n Main articles \n Bioenergy \n Biomass \n Biogas \n and \n Biofuel \n Sugarcane plantation \n to produce \n ethanol \n in Brazil \n A \n CHP power station \n using wood to supply households in France \n Biomass is \n biological material \n derived from living or recently living organisms It most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called \n lignocellulosic biomass \n As an energy source biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat or indirectly after converting it to various forms of \n biofuel \n Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into \n thermal \n chemical \n and \n biochemical \n methods Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today \n examples include forest residues such as dead trees branches and \n tree stumps \n yard clippings wood chips and even \n municipal solid waste \n In the second sense biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial \n chemicals \n including \n biofuels \n Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants including \n miscanthus \n switchgrass \n hemp \n corn \n poplar \n willow \n sorghum \n sugarcane \n bamboo \n and a variety of tree species ranging from \n eucalyptus \n to \n oil palm \n palm oil \n Plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy Some examples of these plants are wheat which typically yield tonnes of grain per hectare and straw which typically yield tonnes per hectare in the UK \n The grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity Plant biomass can also be degraded from \n cellulose \n to \n glucose \n through a series of chemical treatments and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first generation biofuel \n Biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like \n methane \n gas or transportation fuels like \n ethanol \n and \n biodiesel \n Rotting garbage and agricultural and human waste all release methane gas also called \n landfill gas \n or \n biogas \n Crops such as corn and sugarcane can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel ethanol Biodiesel another transportation fuel can be produced from left-over food products like vegetable oils and animal fats \n Also biomass to liquids BTLs and cellulosic ethanol are still under research \n There is a great deal of research involving \n algal fuel \n or algae-derived biomass due to the fact that it's a non-food resource and can be produced at rates to times those of other types of land-based agriculture such as corn and soy Once harvested it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol \n butanol \n and methane as well as biodiesel and \n hydrogen \n The biomass used for electricity generation varies by region Forest by-products such as wood residues are common in the United States Agricultural waste is common in \n Mauritius \n sugar cane residue and \n Southeast Asia \n rice husks Animal husbandry residues such as poultry litter are common in the United Kingdom \n Biofuels \n include a wide range of fuels which are derived from \n biomass \n The term covers \n solid \n liquid \n and \n gaseous \n fuels \n Liquid biofuels include bioalcohols such as bioethanol and oils such as biodiesel Gaseous biofuels include \n biogas \n landfill gas \n and \n synthetic gas \n Bioethanol \n is an alcohol made by \n fermenting \n the sugar components of plant materials and it is made mostly from sugar and starch crops These include maize sugarcane and more recently \n sweet sorghum \n The latter crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions and is being investigated by \n International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics \n for its potential to provide fuel along with food and animal feed in arid parts of Asia and Africa \n With advanced technology being developed cellulosic biomass such as trees and grasses are also used as feedstocks for ethanol production Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form but it is usually used as a \n gasoline \n additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions Bioethanol is widely used in the \n United States \n and in \n Brazil \n The energy costs for producing bio-ethanol are almost equal to the energy yields from bio-ethanol However according to the \n European Environment Agency \n biofuels do not address global warming concerns \n Biodiesel is made from \n vegetable oils \n animal fats \n or recycled greases It can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form or more commonly as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using \n transesterification \n and is the most common biofuel in Europe Biofuels provided 7% of the world's transport fuel in \n Biomass biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat/power and in doing so harm the environment Pollutants such as sulphurous oxides SO \n x \n nitrous oxides NO \n x \n and particulate matter PM are produced from the combustion of biomass the World Health Organisation estimates that million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution \n Biomass combustion is a major contributor \n The life cycle of the plants is sustainable the lives of people less so \n Energy storage \n Main articles \n Energy storage \n and \n Grid energy storage \n Energy storage is a collection of methods used to \n store electrical energy \n on an \n electrical power grid \n or off it Electrical energy is stored during times when production especially from intermittent power plants such as renewable electricity sources such as \n wind power \n tidal power \n solar power \n exceeds consumption and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption \n Pumped-storage hydroelectricity \n is used for more than 90% of all grid power storage \n Market and industry trends \n Renewable energy commercialization \n Renewable power has been more effective in creating jobs than coal or oil in the United States \n Growth of renewables \n Global growth of renewables through to \n Comparing worldwide energy use the growth of renewable energy is shown by the green line \n From the end of worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 1060% annually for many technologies In global investment in renewables rose 5% to $285 billion breaking the previous record of $278 billion in was also the first year that saw renewables excluding large hydro account for the majority of all new power capacity 134GW making up 6% of the total Of the renewables total wind accounted for 72GW and solar photovoltaics 56GW both record-breaking numbers and sharply up from figures 49GW and 45GW respectively In financial terms solar made up 56% of total new investment and wind accounted for 38% \n Projections vary The EIA has predicted that almost two thirds of net additions to power capacity will come from renewables by due to the combined policy benefits of local pollution decarbonisation and energy diversification Some studies have set out roadmaps to power 100% of the worlds energy with wind hydroelectric and solar by the year \n According to a projection by the International Energy Agency solar power generators may produce most of the world's electricity within years reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment Cedric Philibert senior analyst in the renewable energy division at the IEA said \"Photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world's demand for electricity by and half of all energy needs with wind hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation\" \"Photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity\" Philibert said \n In global \n wind power \n capacity expanded 16% to MW \n Yearly wind energy production is also growing rapidly and has reached around 4% of worldwide electricity usage \n 4% in the EU \n and it is widely used in \n Asia \n and the \n United States \n In worldwide installed photovoltaics capacity increased to \n gigawatts \n GW sufficient to supply percent of global \n electricity demands \n Solar thermal energy \n stations

cheaper through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition A IEA report said \"A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support \" and added that \"cost reductions in critical technologies such as wind and solar are set to continue \" \n Hydro-electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity Renewable energy costs continue to drop and the levelised cost of electricity \n LCOE \n is declining for wind power solar photovoltaic \n PV \n concentrated solar power \n CSP \n and some biomass technologies \n Renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources As the cost of renewable power falls the scope of economically viable applications increases Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity Where \"oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source e g on islands off-grid and in some countries a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today\" \n A series of studies by the US \n National Renewable Energy Laboratory \n modeled the \"grid in the Western US under a number of different scenarios where intermittent renewables accounted for percent of the total power \" In the models inefficiencies in cycling the fossil fuel plants to compensate for the variation in solar and wind energy resulted in an additional cost of \"between $0 and $1 to each MegaWatt hour generated\" however the savings in the cost of the fuels saved \"adds up to $7 billion meaning the added costs are at most two percent of the savings \" \n Hydroelectricity \n Only a quarter of the worlds estimated hydroelectric potential of TWh/year has been developed the regional potentials for the growth of hydropower around the world are 71% Europe 75% North America 79% South America 95% Africa 95% Middle East 82% Asia Pacific However the political realities of new reservoirs in western countries economic limitations in the third world and the lack of a transmission system in undeveloped areas result in the possibility of developing 25% of the remaining potential before with the bulk of that being in the Asia Pacific area \n There is slow growth taking place in Western counties but not in the conventional dam and reservoir style of the past New projects take the form of \n run-of-the-river \n and \n small hydro \n neither using large reservoirs It is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid \n Where circumstances permit existing dams like the \n Russell Dam built in \n may be updated with \"pump back\" facilities for \n pumped-storage \n which is useful for peak loads or to support intermittent wind and solar power Countries with large hydroelectric developments like Canada and \n Norway are spending \n billions to expand their grids to trade with neighboring countries having limited hydro \n Wind power development \n Wind power by country \n Worldwide growth of wind capacity \n Four offshore wind farms are in the \n Thames Estuary \n area \n

Although offshore capacity doubled within three years from 117MW in it accounted for only 3% of the total wind power capacity The \n United Kingdom \n is the undisputed leader of offshore power with

source of electricity by with solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power contributing 16% and 11% respectively This requires an increase of installed PV capacity to 600GW of which more than half is expected to be deployed in China and \n India \n Photovoltaic power stations \n List of photovoltaic power stations \n Solar panels \n at the MW \n Topaz Solar Farm \n Nellis Solar Power Plant \n photovoltaic power plant \n in \n Nevada \n USA \n Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s As the cost of solar electricity has fallen the number of grid-connected \n solar PV systems \n has \n grown into the millions \n and utility-scale \n solar power stations \n with hundreds of megawatts are being built Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun \n Many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built mainly in Europe China and the USA \n The 579MW \n Solar Star \n in the United States is the \n world's largest PV power station \n Many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than fixed-mounted systems There are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations \n However when it comes to renewable energy systems and PV it is not just large systems that matter \n Building-integrated photovoltaics \n or \"onsite\" PV systems use existing land and structures and generate power close to where it is consumed \n Biofuel development \n Ethanol fuel \n Sustainable biofuel \n and \n Issues relating to biofuels \n Brazil \n produces \n bioethanol \n made from sugarcane available throughout the country A typical gas station with dual fuel service is marked \"A\" for \n alcohol ethanol \n and \"G\" for gasoline \n Biofuels provided 3% of the world's transport \n fuel \n in \n Mandates for blending biofuels exist in countries at the national level and in states/provinces \n According to the International Energy Agency biofuels have the potential to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by \n Since the 1970s \n Brazil has had an ethanol fuel program \n which has allowed the country to become the world's second largest producer of \n ethanol \n after the United States and the world's largest exporter \n Brazil's ethanol fuel program uses modern equipment and cheap \n sugarcane \n as feedstock and the residual cane-waste \n bagasse \n is used to produce heat and power \n There are no longer light vehicles in Brazil running on pure gasoline By the end of there were filling stations throughout Brazil with at least one ethanol pump \n Unfortunately \n Operation Car Wash \n has seriously eroded public trust in oil companies and has implicated several high ranking Brazilian officials \n Nearly all the gasoline sold in the United States today is mixed with 10% ethanol \n and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends \n Ford \n Daimler AG \n and \n GM \n are among the automobile companies that sell \"flexible-fuel\" cars trucks and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol By mid-2006 there were approximately million ethanol compatible vehicles on U S roads \n Geothermal development \n Geothermal energy in the United States \n Geothermal plant at \n The Geysers \n California USA \n Geothermal power is cost effective reliable sustainable and environmentally friendly \n but has historically been limited to areas near \n tectonic plate \n boundaries Recent technological advances have expanded the range and size of viable resources especially for applications such as home heating opening a potential for widespread exploitation Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels As a result geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate \n global warming \n if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels \n The \n International Geothermal Association \n IGA has reported that MW of geothermal power in countries is online which is expected to generate GWh of electricity in \n This represents a 20% increase in geothermal power online capacity since IGA projects this will grow to MW by due to the large number of projects presently under consideration often in areas previously assumed to have little exploitable resource \n In the United States led the world in \n geothermal electricity \n production with MW of installed capacity from power plants \n the largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at \n The Geysers \n a geothermal field in California \n The Philippines follows the US as the second highest producer of geothermal power in the world with MW of capacity online geothermal power makes up approximately 18% of the country's electricity generation \n Developing countries \n Renewable energy in developing countries \n Solar cookers \n use sunlight as energy source for outdoor cooking \n Renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics and affordable only in the affluent developed world This erroneous view has persisted for many years but was the first year when investment in non-hydro renewables was higher in developing countries with $156 billion invested mainly in China India and Brazil \n Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries In rural and remote areas transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative \n Technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power the approximately billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity Even though they are typically very poor these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene \n As of an estimated million households get power from small solar PV systems \n Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita More than very small solar panels each producing to watts are sold in Kenya annually Some \n Small Island Developing States \n SIDS are also turning to solar power to reduce their costs and increase their sustainability \n Micro-hydro configured into mini-grids also provide power Over million households use \n biogas \n made in household-scale digesters for \n lighting \n and/or \n cooking \n and more than million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves \n Clean liquid fuel sourced from renewable feedstocks are used for cooking and lighting in energy-poor areas of the developing world Alcohol fuels ethanol and methanol can be produced sustainably from non-food sugary starchy and cellulostic feedstocks Project Gaia Inc and CleanStar Mozambique are implementing clean cooking programs with liquid ethanol stoves in Ethiopia Kenya Nigeria and Mozambique \n Renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to \n poverty reduction \n by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking space heating and lighting Renewable energy can also contribute to education by providing electricity to schools \n Industry and policy trends \n Renewable energy commercialization \n Global New Investments in Renewable Energy \n U S President \n Barack Obama \n 's \n American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of \n includes more than $70 billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs Leading renewable energy companies include \n First Solar \n Gamesa \n GE Energy \n Hanwha Q Cells \n Sharp Solar \n Siemens \n SunOpta \n Suntech Power \n and \n Vestas \n Many national state and local governments have also created \n green banks \n A green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies \n Green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy \n The military has also focused on the use of \n renewable fuels \n for military vehicles Unlike fossil fuels renewable fuels can be produced in any country creating a strategic advantage The US military has already committed itself to have 50% of its energy consumption come from alternative sources \n The \n International Renewable Energy Agency \n IRENA is an \n intergovernmental organization \n for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate \n capacity building \n and technology transfer IRENA was formed on January by 75countries signing the charter of IRENA \n As of March IRENA has 143member states who all are considered as founding members of which have also ratified the statute \n As of countries have some form of national renewable energy policy target or renewable support policy National targets now exist in at least countries There is also a wide range of policies at state/provincial and local levels \n United Nations' Secretary-General \n Ban Ki-moon \n has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity \n In October he \"announced the creation of a high-level group to drum up support for energy access energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy The group is to be co-chaired by Kandeh Yumkella the chair of UN Energy and director general of the UN Industrial Development Organisation and Charles Holliday chairman of Bank of America\" \n 100% renewable energy \n 100% renewable energy \n The incentive to use 100% renewable energy for electricity transport or even total primary energy supply globally has been motivated by \n global warming \n and other ecological as well as economic concerns The \n Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand \n Renewable energy use \n has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated \n At the national level at least nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply Also Professors S Pacala and \n Robert H Socolow \n have developed a series of \" \n stabilization wedges \n \" that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change and \"renewable energy sources \" in aggregate constitute the largest number of their \"wedges\" \n Using 100% renewable energy was first suggested in a \n Science \n paper published in by Danish physicist \n Bent Srensen \n It was followed by several other proposals until in the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published These were followed by the first detailed 100% scenarios In a PhD thesis was published by Czisch in which it was shown that in a 100% renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in Europa and North Africa In the same year Danish Energy professor \n Henrik Lund \n published a first paper \n in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables which was followed by several other papers on the \n transition \n to 100% renewable energy in Denmark Since then Lund has been publishing several papers on 100% renewable energy After publications began to rise steeply covering 100% scenarios for countries in Europa America Australia and other parts of the world \n In \n Mark Z Jacobson \n professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and Mark Delucchi published a study on 100% renewable global energy supply in the journal \n Energy Policy \n They found producing all new energy with \n wind power \n solar power \n and \n hydropower \n by is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be \"primarily social and political not technological or economic\" They also found that energy costs with a wind solar water system should be similar to today's energy costs \n Similarly in the United States the independent National Research Council has noted that \"sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change energy security and the escalation of energy costs Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States taken collectively can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand \" \n The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological According to the \n Post Carbon Pathways \n report which reviewed many international studies the key roadblocks are \n climate change denial \n the \n fossil fuels lobby \n political inaction unsustainable energy consumption outdated energy infrastructure and financial constraints \n Emerging technologies \n Other renewable energy technologies are still under development and include \n cellulosic ethanol \n hot-dry-rock \n geothermal power and \n marine energy \n These technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research development and demonstration RD&D funding \n There are numerous organizations within the academic federal and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy This research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum Most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields \n Multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years Two of the most prominent of these labs are \n Sandia National Laboratories \n and the \n National Renewable Energy Laboratory \n NREL both of which are funded by the \n United States Department of Energy \n and supported by various corporate partners \n Sandia has a total budget of $2 billion \n while NREL has a budget of $375 million \n Enhanced geothermal system \n Enhanced geothermal system \n see \n file description \n for details \n Enhanced geothermal systems EGS are a new type of geothermal power technologies that do not require natural convective hydrothermal resources The vast majority of geothermal energy within drilling reach is in dry and non-porous rock \n EGS technologies \"enhance\" and/or create geothermal resources in this \"hot dry rock HDR \" through \n hydraulic stimulation \n EGS and HDR technologies like hydrothermal geothermal are expected to be baseload resources which produce power hours a day like a fossil plant Distinct from hydrothermal HDR and EGS may be feasible anywhere in the world depending on the economic limits of drill depth Good locations are over deep \n granite \n covered by a thick 35km layer of insulating sediments which slow heat loss \n There are HDR and EGS systems currently being developed and tested in France Australia Japan Germany the U S and Switzerland The largest EGS project in the world is a megawatt demonstration plant currently being developed in the Cooper Basin Australia The Cooper Basin has the potential to generate 000MW \n Cellulosic ethanol \n Several refineries that can process biomass and turn it into ethanol are built by companies such as \n Iogen \n POET \n and \n Abengoa \n while other companies such as the \n Verenium Corporation \n Novozymes \n and Dyadic International \n are producing enzymes which could enable future \n commercialization \n The shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players from farmers to biotechnology firms and from project developers to investors \n Marine energy \n Rance Tidal Power Station \n France \n Marine energy also sometimes referred to as ocean energy refers to the energy carried by \n ocean waves \n tides \n salinity \n and \n ocean temperature differences \n The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of \n kinetic energy \n or energy in motion This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes transport and industries The term marine energy encompasses both \n wave power \n power from surface waves and \n tidal power \n obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water \n Reverse electrodialysis \n RED is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose as of it is being tested at a small scale kW \n Offshore wind power \n is not a form of marine energy as wind power is derived from the \n wind \n even if the \n wind turbines \n are placed over water The \n oceans \n have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations Ocean energy

convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current \n Floating solar arrays \n Floating solar arrays \n are PV systems that float on the surface of drinking water reservoirs quarry lakes irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds A small number of such systems exist in France India Japan South Korea the United Kingdom Singapore and the United States \n The systems are said to have advantages over photovoltaics on land The cost of land is more expensive and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation Unlike most land-based solar plants floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view They achieve higher efficiencies than PV panels on land because water cools the panels The panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion \n In May the Far Niente Winery in Oakville California pioneered the world's first floatovoltaic system by installing solar PV modules with a total capacity of 477kW onto pontoons and floating them on the winery's irrigation pond \n Utility-scale floating PV farms are starting to be built \n Kyocera \n will develop the world's largest a 4MW farm on the reservoir above Yamakura Dam in \n Chiba Prefecture \n using solar panels \n Salt-water resistant floating farms are also being constructed for ocean use \n The largest so far announced floatovoltaic project is a 350MW power station in the Amazon region of Brazil \n Solar-assisted heat pump \n A \n heat pump \n is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a \"heat sink\" Heat pumps are designed to move \n thermal energy \n opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one A solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a \n heat pump \n and \n thermal solar panels \n in a single integrated system Typically these two technologies are used separately or only placing them in parallel to produce \n hot water \n In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump's evaporator \n The goal of this system is to get high \n COP \n and then produce energy in a more \n efficient \n and less expensive way \n It is possible to use any type of solar thermal panel sheet and tubes roll-bond heat pipe thermal plates or \n hybrid \n mono \n / \n polycrystalline \n thin film \n in combination with the heat pump The use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows to cover a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduce the power consumption and consequently the \n variable costs \n of the system \n Artificial photosynthesis \n Artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including \n nanotechnology \n to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol \n Researchers in this field are striving to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis that utilize a wider region of the solar spectrum employ catalytic systems made from abundant inexpensive materials that are robust readily repaired non-toxic stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds i e carbohydrates rather than building and sustaining living cells \n However prominent research faces hurdles Sun Catalytix a MIT spin-off stopped scaling up their prototype fuel-cell in because it offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight \n Algae fuels \n Producing liquid fuels from oil-rich varieties of algae is an ongoing research topic Various microalgae grown in open or closed systems are being tried including some system that can be set up in brownfield and desert lands \n Solar aircraft \n In \n Solar Impulse \n was the first \n solar-powered aircraft \n to complete \n circumnavigation \n of the world \n An \n electric aircraft \n is an aircraft that runs on \n electric motors \n rather than \n internal combustion engines \n with electricity coming from \n fuel cells \n solar cells \n ultracapacitors \n power beaming \n or \n batteries \n Currently flying manned electric aircraft are mostly experimental demonstrators though many small \n unmanned aerial vehicles \n are powered by batteries \n Electrically powered model aircraft \n have been flown since the 1970s with one report in \n The first man-carrying electrically powered flights were made in \n Between 2015-2016 a manned solar-powered plane \n Solar Impulse \n completed a circumnavigation of the Earth \n Solar updraft tower \n The Solar updraft tower is a renewable-energy \n power plant \n for generating electricity from low temperature solar heat Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall \n chimney \n tower The resulting \n convection \n causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the \n chimney effect \n This airflow drives \n wind turbines \n placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce \n electricity \n Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation and may allow development of other applications such as water extraction or distillation and agriculture or horticulture A more advanced version of a similarly themed technology is the \n Vortex engine \n which aims to replace large physical chimneys with a \n vortex \n of air created by a shorter less-expensive structure \n Space-based solar power \n For either photovoltaic or thermal systems one option is to loft them into space particularly Geosynchronous orbit To be competitive with Earth-based solar power systems the specific mass kg/kW times the cost to loft mass plus the cost of the parts needs to be $2400 or less I e for a parts cost plus rectenna of $1100/kW the product of the $/kg and kg/kW must be $1300/kW or less \n Thus for 5kg/kW the transport cost cannot exceed $200/kg While that will require a to one reduction SpaceX is targeting a ten to one reduction Reaction Engines may make a to one reduction possible \n Debate \n Main articles \n Renewable energy debate \n Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy \n and \n Green job \n Renewable electricity production from sources such as wind power and solar power is sometimes criticized for being variable or \n intermittent \n but is not true for concentrated solar geothermal and biofuels that have continuity In any case the \n International Energy Agency \n has stated that deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and through local generation contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks \n There have been \"not in my back yard\" \n NIMBY \n concerns relating to the visual and other impacts of some \n wind farms \n with local residents sometimes fighting or blocking construction \n In the USA the Massachusetts \n Cape Wind \n project was delayed for years partly because of aesthetic concerns However residents in other areas have been more positive According to a town councilor the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the \n Ardrossan Wind Farm \n in Scotland has enhanced the area \n A recent UK Government document states that \"projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities This means giving communities both a say and a stake\" \n In countries such as Germany and Denmark many renewable projects are owned by communities particularly through \n cooperative \n structures and contribute significantly to overall levels of renewable energy deployment \n The market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow \n Climate change \n concerns and increasing in \n green jobs \n coupled with \n high oil prices \n peak oil \n oil wars \n oil spills \n promotion of \n electric vehicles \n and renewable electricity nuclear disasters and increasing government support are driving increasing renewable energy legislation incentives and \n commercialization \n New government spending regulation and policies helped the industry weather the economic crisis better than many other sectors \n While renewables have been very successful in their ever growing contribution to electrical power there are no countries dominated by fossil fuels who have a \n plan to stop \n and get that power from renwables Only Scotland and Ontario have stopped burning coal largely due to good natural gas supplies In the area of transportation fossil fuels are even more entrenched and solutions harder to find \n It's unclear if there are failures with policy or renewable energy but twenty years after the Kyoto Protocol fossil fuels are still our primary energy source and consumption continues to grow \n Environmental impact \n Main articles \n Renewable Heat Incentive scandal \n Operation Car Wash \n and \n Biomass Environmental damage \n The ability of \n biomass \n and \n biofuels \n to contribute to a reduction in CO \n emissions is limited because both biomass and biofuels emit large amounts of air

{"theme.id": 5, "title": "Collaborative innovation network", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_innovation_network", "depth": 1, "text": "Collaborative innovation network \n Collaborative innovation \n is a process in which multiple players within and outside an organization contribute towards creating and developing new products services processes and business solutions It might include the involvement of customers suppliers and multiple stakeholders such as agencies and consultants \n Usually firms that promote open forms of collaboration benefit from having access to different capabilities and knowledge enhancing their competitiveness and accelerating their innovation process On one hand it enables small companies such as start-ups to partner with other players complementing each other and taking advantage of different perspectives and resources On the other hand it helps large companies to speed-up their innovation process and time-to-market overcoming bureaucracy and inflexible procedures \n Collaboration can occur in all aspects of the business cycle depending on the context \n Procurement and supplier collaboration \n Research and development of new products services and technologies \n Marketing distribution and commercialization \n Collaborative innovation network \n CoIN \n is a type of collaborative innovation practice that makes use of the internet platforms such as email chat social networks blogs and Wikis to promote communication and innovation within self-organizing virtual teams The difference is that people that collaborate in CoIN are so intrinsically motivated that might not be paid nor get any advantage \n Thus a CoIN is a \n social construct \n with a huge potential for innovation It has been defined by the originator of the term Peter Gloor from \n MIT \n Sloan's Center for \n Collective Intelligence \n as \"a cyberteam of self- \n motivated \n people with a collective vision enabled by the \n Web \n to \n collaborate \n in achieving a common goal by sharing ideas \n information \n and work\" \n Indeed CoIN is a type of open collaboration that helps organizations to become more creative productive and efficient By adopting CoIN as part of their culture these companies accelerate innovation uncover hidden business opportunities reduce costs and enhance synergies They not only can engage employees from every level of hierarchy towards a common project discovering new talents and promoting direct relation between employees but also partner with external parties \n Similar is the concept of the \"Self-Organizing Innovation Network\" it has been described by author Robert Rycroftof the \n Elliott School of International Affairs \n of \n George Washington University \n Overview \n Examples of CoIN \n Current Challenges \n Future \n Further reading \n Overview \n CoINs feature internal transparency and direct communication Members of a COIN collaborate and share knowledge directly with each other rather than through hierarchies They come together with a shared vision because they are intrinsically motivated to do so and seek to collaborate in some way to advance an idea \n CoINs work across hierarchies and boundaries in which members can directly and openly exchange ideas and information This collaborative and transparent environment fosters innovation Gloor describes phenomenon as swarm creativity According to him COINs are the best engines to drive innovation \n CoINs existed well before the advent of modern communication technology However internet and instant communication improved productivity and enabled the reach of a global scale Today they rely on \n Internet \n e-mail \n and other communications vehicles for information sharing \n According to Peter Gloor \n CoINs have main characteristics \n Dispersed Membership \n technology allows members to be spread over the world Regardless of the location members share a common goal and are convinced of their common cause \n Interdependent Membership \n cooperation between members is key to achieve common goal The work of one member is affected and interdependent on the others work \n No simple chain of command \n there is no superior command It is a decentralized and self-organized system Conflicts are solved without the need of a hierarchy or authority \n Work towards a common goal \n members are willing to contribute work and share freely They are intrinsically motivated to donate their work create and share knowledge in favor of a common goal \n Dependence on trust \n cooperative behavior and mutual trust is needed to work efficiently within the network Members act accordingly to an ethical code that states the rules and principles to be followed by all members Usually ethical codes include principles related to respect consistency reciprocity and rationality \n There also are five essential elements of collaborative innovation networks what Gloor calls as \" \n genetic code \n \" \n They are learning networks \n they set an informal and flexible environment which facilitates and stimulates collaboration and the exchange of ideas information and knowledge \n They need an ethical code \n they agree on an ethical code that guides the conduct and behavior of the members \n They are based on trust and \n self-organization \n members trust each other without the need of a centralized management They are brought together by mutual respect and strong sense of shared beliefs \n They make knowledge accessible to everyone \n CoINs nurture communication to an extent that information shared with everyone Nowadays with internet and social medias their ideas and concepts achieve a global level \n They operate in internal honesty and transparency \n they create a system based on reciprocal trust and mutually established principles \n Examples of CoIN \n CoINs have been developing many disruptive innovations such as the Internet Linux the Web and Wikipedia These inventions were created in universities or labs by a group of enthusiastic students with little or no budget They were not focused on the money but on the sense of accomplishment \n The \n Web \n is the early version of Internet It was driven by a CoIN of intrinsically motivated people that wanted to improve technical development and launch a disruptive solution Their goal was to link mainframes and allow multiple users simultaneously \n Another important contribution of CoIN was \n Linux \n an operating system for personal computing that directly competes with Microsoft It was initially developed by a student called Linus Torvalds and later became an open source software Today the code is publicly available and anyone can contribute or enhance it The success of Linus is the constant and continuous updated which is done at much lower cost than closed source software \n Last but not least \n Wikipedia \n gathers thousands of volunteers that constantly write and update content Although it does not have a hierarchy nor a central authority the entries are mostly accurate and complete Volunteers share a have a strong feeling of community and willingness to contribute towards knowledge without being paid for it \n Faced with these creations large companies such as IBM and Intel have learnt to use the principles of open innovation to enhance their research learning curve They increased or established collaborations with universities agencies and small companies to accelerate their processes and launch new services faster \n Current Challenges \n Although it exists for long time Collaborative Innovation still needs to be empowered A more collaborative approach involving stakeholders such as governments corporations entrepreneurs and scholars is key to tackle the main challenges facing today \n First of all it is still important to raise the awareness of CoIN and its benefits among companies and major economic fields Policy makers and corporate leaders could support the development of programs strategies and educational plans to stimulate CoINs in specific sectors benefiting the whole economy \n Second the overall legal and regulatory framework still needs to evolve to foster cross-firm collaboration Fiscal and intellectual property regimes should be reviewed to provide the necessary infrastructure to nourish CoINs A further stimulus is important to encourage the creation of start-ups and the development of a network of partners across companies \n Finally financial aid should be granted to support collaborative projects related to technology research and innovation CoINs have an enormous potential to deliver innovation and drive significant gains in competitiveness However they need resources in order to fully operate and reach their maximum potential \n Future \n As COINs become increasingly popular among governments and corporations the ethical financial economic and cognitive issues which drive incentives will inevitably face challenges Over time potential innovators may be unwilling to participate in projects merely on the basis of implied financial gain As globalization begins to impact traditional models of planned social progress the broader political context in which participants cooperate has become more relevant lately This suggests an increased need for independent parties to collaborate on the basis of agreed upon principles and objectives ultimately this could encompass the interests of humanity and the emergence of a global culture \n General theory of collaboration \n

on the history of the term see \n The notion of design as a \"way of thinking\" in \n the sciences \n can be traced to \n Herbert A Simon \n 's book \n The Sciences of the Artificial \n and in \n design engineering \n to Robert McKim's book \n Experiences in Visual Thinking \n Bryan Lawson's book \n How Designers Think \n primarily addressing design in architecture began a process of generalising the concept of design thinking \n A article by Nigel Cross established some of the intrinsic qualities and abilities of design thinking that made it relevant in general education and thus for wider audiences \n Peter Rowe's book \n Design Thinking \n which described methods and approaches used by architects and urban planners was a significant early usage of the term in the design research literature \n Rolf Faste \n expanded on McKim's work at \n Stanford University \n in the 1980s and 1990s \n teaching \"design thinking as a method of creative action \" \n Design thinking was adapted for business purposes by Faste's Stanford colleague \n David M Kelley \n who founded the design consultancy \n IDEO \n in \n Richard Buchanan \n 's article \"Wicked Problems in Design Thinking\" expressed a broader view of design thinking as addressing intractable human concerns through design \n Play media \n Design thinking example video \n Solution-based thinking \n Design thinking is a method for practical \n creative \n resolution of problems It is a form of solution-based thinking with the intent of producing a constructive future result \n Design thinking differs from the \n scientific method \n which begins by stating a hypothesis and then via a feedback mechanism continues iteratively to form a model or theory by including consideration of the emotional content of the situation While feedback in the scientific method is mostly obtained by collecting observational evidence with respect to observable/measurable facts design thinking feedback also considers the consumer's emotional state regarding the problem as well as their stated and latent needs in discovering and developing solutions In scientific methods with a heavy emphasis on math or physics emotional elements are typically ignored Design thinking identifies and investigates both known and ambiguous aspects of the current situation in an effort to discover parameters and alternative solution sets which may lead to one or more satisfactory goals Because design thinking is \n iterative \n intermediate \"solutions\" are potential starting points of alternative paths allowing for redefinition of the initial problem in a process of co-evolution of problem and solution \n Designers vs Scientists \n In Bryan Lawson published results from an empirical study to investigate the different problem-solving approaches of designers and scientists He took two groups of students final year students in architecture and post-graduate science students and asked them to create one-layer structures from a set of coloured blocks The perimeter of the structure had to optimize either the red or the blue colour however there were unspecified rules governing the placement and relationship of some of the blocks Lawson found that \n The scientists adopted a technique of trying out a series of designs which used as many different blocks and combinations of blocks as possible as quickly as possible Thus they tried to maximise the information available to them about the allowed combinations If they could discover the rule governing which combinations of blocks were allowed they could then search for an arrangement which would optimise the required colour around the layout \n problem-focused \n By contrast the architects selected their blocks in order to achieve the appropriately coloured perimeter If this proved not to be an acceptable combination then the next most favourably coloured block combination would be substituted and so on until an acceptable solution was discovered \n solution-focused \n Bryan Lawson How Designers Think \n Nigel Cross \n concluded that Lawson's studies suggested that scientists problem solve by analysis while designers problem solve by synthesis \n Kelley and Brown argue that design thinking uses both analysis and synthesis \n citation needed \n Analysis and synthesis \n The terms analysis and synthesis come from classical Greek and mean literally \"to loosen up\" and \"to put together\" respectively In general analysis is defined as the procedure by which we break down an intellectual or substantial whole into parts or components Synthesis is defined as the opposite procedure to combine separate elements or components in order to form a coherent whole However analysis and synthesis as scientific methods always go hand in hand they complement one another Every synthesis is built upon the results of a preceding analysis and every analysis requires a subsequent synthesis in order to verify and correct its results \n Divergent thinking versus convergent thinking \n Design thinking employs \n divergent thinking \n as a way to ensure that many possible solutions are explored in the first instance and then \n convergent thinking \n as a way to narrow these down to a final solution Divergent thinking is the ability to offer different unique or variant ideas adherent to one theme while convergent thinking is the ability to find the \"correct\" solution to the given problem Design thinking encourages divergent thinking to ideate many solutions possible or impossible and then uses convergent thinking to prefer and realize the best resolution \n Design thinking as a process for problem-solving \n Unlike \n analytical \n thinking design thinking includes \"building up\" ideas with few or no limits on breadth during a \"brainstorming\" phase \n This helps reduce fear of failure in the participant s and encourages input and participation from a wide variety of sources in the ideation phases The phrase \" \n thinking outside the box \n \" has been coined to describe one goal of the brainstorming phase and is encouraged since this can aid in the discovery of hidden elements and ambiguities in the situation and discovering potentially faulty assumptions \n One version of the design thinking process has seven stages \n define research ideate prototype choose implement \n and \n learn \n Within these seven steps problems can be framed the right questions can be asked more ideas can be created and the best answers can be chosen The steps aren't linear can occur simultaneously and be repeated A simpler expression of the process is Robert McKim's phrase \"ExpressTestCycle\" \n An alternative five-phase description of the process is described by \n Christoph Meinel \n and Larry Leifer \n re defining the problem needfinding and benchmarking ideating building testing \n Yet another way to look at it is \n Shewhart \n 's \"Plan-Do-Study-Act\" \n PDSA \n cycle \n Although design is always influenced by individual preferences the design thinking method shares a common set of traits mainly creativity \n ambidextrous \n thinking \n teamwork \n user-centeredness \n empathy \n curiosity \n and \n optimism \n These traits are exemplified by design thinking methods in \" \n serious play \n \" \n The path through these process steps is not strictly circular Meinel and Leifer state \"While the stages are simple enough the adaptive expertise required to choose the right inflection points and appropriate next stage is a high order intellectual activity that requires practice and is learnable \" \n Attributes of design thinking \n Principles \n Christoph Meinel and Larry Leifer of the HPI-Stanford Design Thinking Program laid out four principles for the successful implementation of design thinking \n The human rule \n which states that all design activity is ultimately social in nature and any social innovation will bring us back to the 'human-centric point of view' \n The ambiguity rule \n in which design thinkers must preserve ambiguity by experimenting at the limits of their knowledge and ability enabling the freedom to see things differently \n The re-design rule \n where all design is re-design this comes as a result of changing technology and social circumstances but previously solved unchanged human needs \n The tangibility rule \n the concept that making ideas tangible always facilitates communication and allows designers to treat prototypes as 'communication media' \n Wicked problems \n Design thinking is especially useful when addressing what \n Horst Rittel \n referred to as \n wicked problems \n which are ill-defined or tricky as opposed to wicked in the sense of \n malicious \n With ill-defined problems both the problem and the solution are unknown at the outset of the problem-solving exercise This is as opposed to \"tame\" or \"well-defined\" problems where the problem is clear and the solution is available through some technical knowledge \n For wicked problems the general thrust of the problem may be clear however considerable time and effort is spent in order to clarify the requirements A large part of the problem solving activity then consists of problem definition and \n problem shaping \n The \"a-ha moment\" \n The \"a-ha moment\" is the moment where there is suddenly a clear forward path \n It is the point in the cycle where synthesis and divergent thinking analysis and convergent thinking and the nature of the problem all come together and an appropriate resolution has been captured Prior to this point the process may seem nebulous hazy and inexact At this point the path forward is so obvious that in retrospect it seems odd that it took so long to recognize it After this point the focus becomes more and more clear as the final product is constructed \n Methods and process \n Design methods \n and \n design process \n are often used interchangeably but there are significant differences between the two \n Design methods \n are techniques rules or ways of doing things that someone uses within a design discipline Methods for design thinking include \n interviewing \n creating \n user profiles \n looking at other existing solutions creating \n prototypes \n mind mapping \n asking questions like the \n five whys \n and situational analysis \n Because of design thinking's parallel nature there are many different paths through the phases This is part of the reason design thinking may seem to be \"fuzzy\" or \"ambiguous\" when compared to more \n analytical \n Cartesian \n methods of science and engineering \n Some early design processes stemmed from \n soft systems methodology \n in the 1960s Koberg and Bagnall wrote \n The All New Universal Traveller \n in and presented a circular seven-step process to problem-solving These seven steps could be done lineally or in feed-back loops \n Stanford's d school developed an updated seven step process in \n Other expressions of design processes have been proposed including a three-step simplified triangular process or the six-part less simplified pyramid by Bryan Lawson \n Hugh Dubberly's free e-book \n How Do You Design A Compendium of Models \n summarizes a large number of design process models \n Design thinking calls for considering the given user case from various perspectives empathizing with users and addressing various stakeholders \n citation needed \n The use of visual analogy in design thinking and learning \n Ill-defined problems often contain higher-order and obscure relationships Design thinking can address these through the use of \n analogies \n An understanding of the expected results or lack of domain-related knowledge for the task may be developed by correlating different internal representations such as images to develop an understanding of the obscure or ill-defined elements of the situation The process involves several complex cognitive mechanisms as the design task often has elements in multiple cognitive domainsvisual mathematical auditory or tactilerequiring the usage of multiple \"languages\" like \n visual thinking \n Design thinking for social innovation \n Social challenges require systemic solutions that are grounded in the client's or customer's needs Nonprofits are beginning to use design thinking as well to develop better solutions to social problems because it crosses the traditional boundaries between public for-profit and nonprofit sectors By working closely with the clients and consumers design thinking allows high-impact solutions to bubble up from below rather than being imposed from the top \n The process of design thinking \n Inspiration ideation and implementation \n As an approach design thinking taps into innate human capacities but that are overlooked by more conventional problem-solving practices It does not only focus on creating products and services that are human centered but the process itself is also deeply human \n The process is best thought of as a system of overlapping spaces rather than a sequence of orderly steps inspiration ideation and implementation \n Inspiration is the initial problem or opportunity that leads you to the finding of the solution ideation is the core of the development process where the idea is better defined and implementation is the final step where the solution comes in contact with the outer world Projects may loop back through inspiration ideation and implementation more than once as the team refines its ideas and explores new directions Therefore design thinking can feel chaotic but over the life of a project participants come to see that the process makes sense and achieves results even though its form differs from the linear milestone-based processes that organizations typically undertake \n Design thinking activities are carried on in different steps which are empathize define ideate prototype and test \n Within these steps problems can be framed the right questions can be asked more ideas can be created and the best answers can be chosen \n Inspiration space and empathy stage \n Generally the design process starts with the inspiration phase in which the previous step is the definition of the brief The brief is a set of mental constraints that gives the project team a framework from which to begin benchmarks by which they can measure progress and a set of objectives to be realizedsuch as price point available technology and market segment \n Designers approach users with empathy understanding what humans need or might need what makes life easier and more enjoyable what is technologically useful and more usable It is not only about making things more ergonomic but about understanding people - the way they do things and why their physical and emotional needs how they think about the world and what is meaningful to them \n Conventional research methods like focus groups and survey can be useful in pointing towards incremental improvements but those don't usually lead to breakthroughs because these techniques simply ask people what they want Henry Ford understood this when he said \"If I'd asked my customers what they wanted they'd have said 'a faster horse \" and no one would have said a car \n Ideation Divergent thinking versus convergent thinking \n Ideate is the mode of the design process in which you concentrate on idea generation Mentally it represents a process of \"going wide\" in terms of concepts and outcomes \n The process is characterized by the alternation of divergent and convergent thinking typical of design thinking process To achieve divergent thinking it is important to have a diverse group of people involved in the process Multidisciplinary peoplearchitects who have studied psychology artists with MBAs or engineers with marketing experienceoften demonstrate this quality They're people with the capacity and the disposition for collaboration across disciplines \n Interdisciplinary teams typically move into a structured brainstorming process by \"thinking outside the box\" During this process own ideas and the other's one have not to be judged and participants shouldn't take a non-generative role \n Instead participants are encouraged to come up with as many ideas as possible and to explore new alternatives Good ideas naturally rise to the top whereas the bad ones drop off early on Every member of the team needs to possess a depth of skill that allows him or her to make tangible contributions to the outcome and to be empathic for people and for disciplines beyond one's own It tends to be expressed as openness curiosity optimism a tendency toward learning through doing and experimentation \n Convergent thinking on the other hand allow to zooming and focusing on the different proposals and to select the best choice which permits to continue the design thinking process to achieve the final goals After collecting lot of ideas a team goes through a process of synthesis in which it has to translate what is been seen and is been headed into insights that can lead to solutions or opportunities for change This approach helps multiply options to create choices and different insights about human behavior and define in which direction the process should go on These might be either visions of new product offerings or choices among various ways of creating interactive experience \n Once there are lot of ideas the following step is to select the most extreme one in order to find solutions that solve unmet needs \n Complexity and mindset conditions \n More choices mean more complexity which can affect organization's decisions to restrict choices in favour of the obvious and the incremental Although this tendency may be more efficient in the short run it tends to make an organization conservative and inflexible in the long run \n Divergent thinking is the route not the obstacle to innovation and a way to diverge is to define a mindset of condition in which people are encouraged to produce lots of ideas The most notable themes fall into three general traits open-minded collaboration courage and conviction \n Open minded refers to the concept of being opened and accept new ideas and contributions Courage is also fundamental because innovative ideas are characterized by a high risk of failure It permits to face failure element of high importance in order to improve in the right way In addition conviction is the mindset which permits to carry on a process or an idea even if there are constrains or obstacles \n Implementation and prototyping \n The third space of the design thinking process is implementation when the best ideas generated during ideation are turned into a concrete fully conceived action plan \n At the core of the implementation process is prototyping turning ideas into actual products and services that are then tested iterated and refined A prototype helps to gather feedbacks and improve the idea Prototypes speed up the process of innovation because allow to understand strengths and weaknesses of new solutions Prototyping is particularly important for products and services destined for the developing world where the lack of infrastructure retail chains communication networks literacy and other essential pieces of the system often make it difficult to design new products and services \n Prototyping testing \"failing many times but quickly and cheaply in order to succeed\" \n are different existing methods to test solutions but the earlier users can give feedbacks the lower are the costs for the organizations and higher is the level of adaptation of the solution to customer needs \n Differences from science and humanities \n Although many design fields have been categorized as lying between science and the arts and humanities design may be seen as its own distinct way of understanding the world based on solution-based problem solving problem shaping synthesis and appropriateness in the built environment \n One of the first \n design science \n theorists \n John Chris Jones \n postulated that design was different than the arts sciences and mathematics in the 1970s In response to the question \"Is designing an art a science or a form of mathematics?\" Jones responded \n The main point of difference is that of \n timing \n Both artists and scientists operate on the physical world as it exists in the \n present \n whether it is real or symbolic while mathematicians operate on abstract relationships that are independent of historical \n time \n Designers on the other hand are forever bound to treat as real that which exists only in an imagined \n future \n and have to specify ways in which the \n foreseen \n thing can be made to exist \n John Chris Jones \n Design Method \n Nigel Cross \n built upon the early work of \n Bruce Archer \n to show the differences between the humanities the sciences and design in his paper \"Designerly Ways of Knowing\" \n He observed that in the sciences the phenomenon of study centres around the natural world the appropriate methods being controlled experiment classification and analysis In this culture objectivity rationality neutrality and a concern for \"truth\" are most valued In the humanities analogy metaphor and evaluation serve as methods of study of the human experience The values of this culture include subjectivity imagination commitment and a concern for \"justice\" Design however concerns itself with the artificial world and uses modeling pattern-forming and synthesis to study it In design practicality ingenuitry empathy and a concern for \"appropriateness\" are the core values \n The languages of design \n Conventionally designers communicate mostly in \n visual or object languages \n Symbols signs and metaphors are used through the medium of sketching diagrams and technical drawings to translate abstract requirements into concrete objects The way designers communicate then is through understanding this way of coding design requirements in order to produce built products \n Design thinking in business \n Design thinking has two common interpretations in the business world \n citation needed \n Designers bringing their methods into business by either taking part themselves in business process or training business people to use design methods \n Designers achieving innovative outputs or products for example the \n iPod \n The first interpretation has been described by Tim Brown CEO of \n IDEO \n at a \n TED \n lecture \n though his blog \n also considers the second interpretation \n The limits of the first kind of design thinking in business are also being explored Not all problems yield to design thinking alone where it may be a \"temporary fix\" \n Design thinking companies including \n IDEO \n and \n Sense Worldwide \n are responding to this by building business thinking capabilities \n Tim Brown has argued that design thinking is now widely but sporadically used in business He argues that competitive advantage comes from sustained use of design thinking from becoming \"masters of the art \" \n In organization and management theory design thinking forms part of the Architecture/Design/Anthropology A/D/A paradigm which characterizes innovative human-centered enterprises This paradigm also focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an \n abductive \n mode of thinking compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics/Economics/Psychology M/E/P management paradigm \n A study by the \n London Business School \n found that for every percent of sales invested in product design profits rose by an average of to percent \n Historically designers were only introduced in the last steps of product development process focusing their attention on improving the look and functionality of products instead looking for a high impact on the world and the society Design was a tool of consumerism able to make products more attractive easier to use and more marketable \n In recent years designers developed specific methods and tools to deliver products and services and businesses are beginning to realize the necessity of design as a competitive asset Therefore designers bring their methods into business by either taking part themselves in the earliest stages of business processes or training business people to use design methods and to build business thinking capabilities Design thinking as the perfect balance between desirability technical feasibility and economic viability helps organizations to be more innovative better differentiate their brands and bring their products and services to market faster \n Design thinking in education \n Design thinking has been suggested for use in schools in a variety of curricular ways \n as well as for redesigning student spaces and school systems \n Design thinking in education typically takes three forms helping school administrators solve institution-based problems aiding educators to develop more creative lesson plans and engendering design thinking skills in students \n There are currently many researchers exploring the intersection of design thinking and education \n The REDLab group from \n Stanford University \n 's Graduate School of Education conducts research into design thinking in K-12 secondary and post-secondary settings \n The Hasso Plattner Design Thinking Research Program is a collaborative program between \n Stanford University \n and the \n Hasso Plattner Institute \n from \n Potsdam \n Germany \n The Hasso Plattner Design Thinking Research Program's mission is to \"apply rigorous academic methods to understand how and why design thinking innovation works and fails \" \n SPJIMR \n a top B-school in India offers a road map to build design thinking culture in the organisation and has implemented the approach across its different management programs \n In addition to enriching curriculum and expanding student perspectives design thinking can also benefit educators Researchers have proposed that design thinking can enable educators to integrate technology into the classroom \n Design thinking as a viable curricular and systemic reform program is increasingly being recognized by educators \"Much of today's education system guides students toward finding the correct answers to fill-in-the blanks on standardized tests as this kind of instruction facilitates streamlined assessments to measure success or failure It is critical that particularly in under-served schools this model of learning does not continue to prevail Students need both the skills and the tools to participate in a society where problems are increasingly complex and nuanced understandings are vital \" \n Uses in K-12 education \n In the K-12 arena design thinking is used to promote creative thinking teamwork and student responsibility for learning The nonprofit Tools at Schools aims to expose students educators and schools to design thinking The organization does this by facilitating a relationship between a school and a manufacturing company Over a minimum of six months representatives from the manufacturing company teach students the principles of design and establish the kind of product to be designed \n The students collaborate to design a prototype that the manufacturer produces \n Once the prototype arrives the students must promote the product and support the ideas that lead to its design \n An example of the Tools at Schools partnership is the redesign of school equipment by 8th grade students at \n The School at Columbia University \n The students were divided into groups and asked to redesign a locker chair or a desk to better suit the needs of 21st century pupils \n The students' final products were displayed at the \n International Contemporary Furniture Fair \n where they demonstrated their product to fair attendees and industry professionals \n Overall Tools at Schools not only introduces students to the design process it exposes them to the design profession through their interactions with designers and manufacturers \n Since the students work together in groups design thinking in education also encourages collaborative learning \n Another organization that works with integrating design thinking for students is the corporation NoTosh NoTosh has a design thinking school to teach instructors how to implement design thinking into their curriculum One of the design thinking techniques NoTosh adopted from the corporate world and applied to education is hexagonal thinking Hexagonal thinking consists of gathering cut-outs in hexagon shapes and writing a concept or fact on each one Students then connect the hexagons by laying related ideas or facts together The visual representation of relationships helps students better conceptualize \n wicked problems \n Another concrete example of design thinking in action is NoTosh's \"Googleable vs NonGoogleable Questions\" exercise \n Given a specific topic students brainstorm questions on that issue and divide their questions into \"Googleable and NonGoogleable \" \n Students research the Googleable questions and present their findings to the class while the NonGoogleable questions are used to create a project \n Stanford University's Taking Design Thinking to Schools Initiative \n Apart from non profit entities and corporations research universities are also involved in deploying design thinking curriculum to K-12 schools Part of \n Stanford University \n 's efforts to incorporate design thinking in education into a hands-on setting is the Taking Design Thinking to Schools initiative The Stanford School of Education and d school partner with K-12 teachers in the \n Palo Alto \n area to discover ways to apply design thinking in an educational setting \n \"Teachers and students engage in hands-on design challenges that focus on developing empathy promoting a bias towards action encouraging ideation developing metacognitive awareness and fostering active problem solving \" \n Taking Design Thinking to Schools identifies the following design thinking process \n Understand \n students explore the topic through research and develop familiarity with the subject matter \n Observe \n this phase consists of students taking note of their environment which includes physical surroundings and human interactions students gather more information about peoples' actions and possible motivation through discussion \n Point of view \n students consider alternate points of views to better understand the problem and to inform their ideas in the next phase \n Ideate \n this phase consists of students brainstorming ideas without criticism or inhibition In this phase the focus is on generating lots of ideas with an emphasis on creativity and enjoying the process \n Prototype \n in this phase students create quick prototypes to investigate ideas generated during the ideation phase \n Test \n students test their ideas in a repetitive fashion and determine which aspects of the design are effective and which could be improved \n By employing this process the Stanford team and Taking Design Thinking to Schools participants collaborate to develop coursework that students will find engrossing and \"hands-on \" \n Thus the program at Stanford combines both design thinking for teachers who must create alternative curriculum and students who must complete the design thinking-based projects \n The K12 Lab at Stanford \n The K12 Lab network is a part of the \n Stanford University \n d school and according to its website its mission is to \"inspire and develop the creative confidence of educators and support edu innovators catalyzing new models for teaching and learning \" \n The K12 Lab Network publishes a wiki with information on creating design challenges for K-12 schools The wiki provides tools for thinking about design challenges as well as criteria for implementing design challenges \n The Design Thinking for Educators toolkit \n The Design Thinking for Educators toolkit was developed in by the design firm IDEO in partnership with the PreK-12 independent school \n Riverdale Country School \n The Design Thinking for Educators toolkit that is currently offered to the public for free download is the second version \n The Design Thinking for Educators toolkit is a comprehensive resource for educators to use which includes a \"walk-through of the design thinking process complete with examples and a downloadable workbook\" \n The toolkit has been used in academic research to aid in the creation of an \" \n iPad \n learning Ecosystem\" \n to help design a program to aid at-risk youth in the transition from elementary to secondary school \n as well as to redesign libraries \n AIGA \n AIGA \n has implemented a movement DesignEd K12 to take designing thinking to schools This movement is guided by volunteers and there is not a specific program to follow instead volunteer designers introduce students to the design field and consequently design thinking DesignEd K12 intends to motivate students to use design thinking to solve problems to create a network where designers students and educational professionals share best practices to shape a recommended approach to teaching design and to cultivate a passion for design among young people \n Across the nation many of AIGA's chapters are working with school districts The programs range in scope some mentor students who have shown an interest in design while other programs offer students the opportunity to explore design and participate in design thinking projects within scheduled classed or through an after-school activity \n Uses in higher education \n Design thinking is currently being taught in \"workshops supplemental training courses or degree programs\" in over universities and colleges \n Design thinking is used by colleges as a way to instruct students on the phases of design and to help develop innovative solutions to existing problems \n The d school at \n Stanford University \n is a well-known design thinking program in higher education with students from Stanford's departments of engineering medicine business law and education utilizing the d school to develop innovative solutions to problems \n The \n University of Kentucky \n also has formalized instruction on design thinking through its dLab The dLab serves a multitude of functions from helping schools resolve their issues with design thinking to conducting empirical experiments on design thinking to collaborating with outside organizations to provide issues that plague their organization \n Radford University \n located in Radford Virginia currently offers a \n Master of Fine Arts \n MFA degree in design thinking \n The MFA degree offered is a completely online degree that emphasizes design thinking design history design research design management and design doing \n The \n Johns Hopkins University \n Carey Business School and the \n Maryland Institute College of Art \n began offering an MBA/MA in design leadership in \n Students simultaneously earn a master of arts degree in design leadership from an art school as well as an MBA from a research institution \n Obstacles to implementing design thinking in schools \n The accountability to succeed on high-stakes standardized tests in K-12 environments prevents the implementation of design thinking curriculum Educators feel that focusing on classic curriculum will better prepare their students to perform well on these exams \n Resistance to design thinking also springs from concerns about the appropriateness of applying design thinking to an educational setting It has been argued that design thinking is best applied by professionals who know a field well \n Therefore K-12 students who are limited by their reduced understanding of both the field and their still developing intellectual capacities may not be best suited to design thinking activities \n Another more subtle obstacle to design thinking in schools may come from members of the academic community who believe design thinking should remain in the milieu of avant-garde companies \n Other issues that may prevent the implementation of design thinking in scholastic settings may be a lack of awareness of the field educators' uncertainty in implementing new approaches to teaching and lack of institutional support \n Even for institutions that see the value of design thinking there is the issue of implementing these new approaches to education successfully Admittedly \"creating an effective thinking and successful team learning experience is a sticky wicked problem \" \n Design thinking in teaching and learning through ICT \n The integration of ICT into teaching and learning presents many challenges that go beyond issues dealing with technical implementation Some researchers have already claimed the limited effects of ICT adoption in learning \n Considering the emphasis and the investment that has been placed on the use of ICT in formal learning settings schools and higher education institutions it is important to identify where the problems are In this regard some voices of the educational community focus on the methods used for integrating ICT in teaching and learning \n In this sense the adoption of a design thinking mindset is regarded as a promising strategy to develop holistic solutions \n Design thinking in teaching and learning through ICT can be considered as similar activities First it's important to acknowledge that the type of problems faced by the educational community when adopting learning technology are unique ill-defined and do not have clear solutions \n This definition corresponds very well to the term \n wicked problems \n used by the design community \n Secondly similarly to what happens in design the diversity of actors brings another layer of complexity that should be recognized In this regard collaboration between different stakeholders during the design process is another key issue that could contribute to develop more meaningful technologies for learning \n Design thinking has been outlined as a meaningful approach for facing \n wicked problems \n The adoption of a design mindset helps understand that there can be many solutions for a given situation and that any design requires testing From this perspective bringing design thinking to learning design and design expertise to the development process of technological learning solutions can contribute to the creation of more holistic solutions in learning through ICT \n pre-1960 \n The origins of new design methods in the 1960s lay further back in the application of novel \"scientific\" methods to the pressing problems of \n World War II \n from which came operational research methods and management decision-making techniques and in the development of creativity techniques in the 1950s Harold van Doren published \n Industrial Design A Practical Guide to Product Design and Development \n which includes discussions of design methods and practices in \n 1960s \n The beginnings of computer programs for problem solving the so-called \n soft-systems approach \n The 1960s marked a desire to \"scientize\" design through use of the computer science soft-systems approach \n The First Conference on Design Methods London UK \n Books on methods and theories of design in different fields are published by \n Morris Asimow \n engineering \n Christopher Alexander \n design patterns \n L Bruce Archer \n industrial design \n and \n John Chris Jones \n architecture \n The first notable books on methods of creativity are published by \n William J J Gordon \n and \n Alex Faickney Osborn \n L Bruce Archer \n professor of Design Research at the Royal College of Art argues that design was \"not merely a craft-based skill but should be considered a knowledge-based discipline in its own right with rigorous methodology and research principles incorporated into the design process\" and states \"The most fundamental challenge to conventional ideas on design has been the growing advocacy of systematic methods of problem solving borrowed from computer techniques and management theory for the assessment of design problems and the development of design solutions \" \n Bruce Archer is arguably the first author to use the term design thinking in his book \"Systematic Method for Designers\" London Council of Industrial Design H M S O \n Herbert A Simon \n notable for his research in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences establishes a \"science of design\" that would be \"a body of intellectually tough analytic partly formalizable partly empirical teachable doctrine about the design process \" \n Visual psychologist \n Rudolf Arnheim \n publishes his book \n Visual Thinking \n which inspires the teaching of ME101 Visual Thinking by Robert McKim in the School of Engineering at \n Stanford University \n 1970s \n Notable for the rejection of design methodology by many including some of the early pioneers \n Christopher Alexander \n architect and theorist wrote \"I've disassociated myself from the field There is so little in what is called 'design methods' that has anything useful to say about how to design buildings that I never even read the literature anymore I would say forget it forget the whole thing \" \n John Chris Jones \n designer and design thinking theorist stated \"In the 1970s I reacted against design methods I dislike the machine language the behaviourism the continual attempt to fix the whole of life into a logical framework \" \n Robert McKim publishes \n Experiences in Visual Thinking \n which includes \"Express Test Cycle\" ETC as an iterative backbone for design processes \n Horst Rittel \n and \n Melvin Webber \n write \"Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning\" showing that design and planning problems are \n wicked problems \n as opposed to \"tame\" single disciplinary problems of science \n Horst Rittel \n also proposes that the developments of the 1960s had been only \"first generation\" methods which naturally with hindsight seemed a bit simplistic but nonetheless had been a necessary beginning and that a new second generation was beginning to emerge \n This suggestion was clever because it let the methodologists escape from their commitment to inadequate \"first generation\" methods and it opened a vista of an endless future of generation upon generation of new methods \n L Bruce Archer \n starts off the next decade's inquiry into designerly ways of knowing stating \"There exists a designerly way of thinking and communicating that is both different from scientific and scholarly ways of thinking and communicating and as powerful as scientific and scholarly methods of inquiry when applied to its own kinds of problems \" \n Bruce Archer is arguably the first one to use the term design thinking \n 1980s \n Systemic engineering design methods are developed particularly in Germany and Japan The International Conferences on Engineering Design ICED is formed \n A series of books on engineering design are published

launched its series of conferences on design theory and methodology \n The 1980s also sees the rise of \n human-centered design \n and the rise of design-centered business management \n Bryan Lawson professor of architecture at \n University of Sheffield \n publishes \n How Designers Think \n about design cognition in the context of architecture and urban planning \n Nigel Cross \n professor of design studies and editor of \n Design Studies \n journal writes \n Designerly Ways of Knowing \n showing design as its own culture to be taught in schools by contrasting it with science culture and arts and humanities culture This is based on the idea that \"There are things to know ways of knowing them and ways of finding out about them that are specific to the design area \" \n Donald Schn \n professor and theorist in \n organizational learning \n published \n The Reflective Practitioner \n in which he sought to establish \"an epistemology of practice implicit in the artistic intuitive processes that design and other practitioners bring to situations of uncertainty instability uniqueness and value conflict \" \n The business management strategy \n Six Sigma \n emerges as a way to

intranet portal \n is the gateway that unifies access to enterprise information and applications \n on an \n intranet \n It is a tool that helps a company manage its data applications and information more easily and through personalized views Some portal solutions today are able to integrate \n legacy applications \n objects from other portals & handle thousands of user requests In a corporate enterprise environment it is also known as an \n enterprise portal \n Main features \n Advantages \n Disadvantages \n Activities \n Notable software tools \n Corporate intranets began gaining popularity during the 1990's As intranets quickly grew more complex the concept of intranet portal was born Today intranet portals provide value-added capabilities such as managing workflows increasing collaboration between work groups and allowing content creators to self-publish their information \n One typical example of a web platform used to build and host an intranet is \n Microsoft Sharepoint \n which is used by 46% of organizations \n It provides a lot of features necessary for collaboration integration and customization \n Main features \n Integration \n Ability to integrate with your current tools or the possibility of adding new tools You have your outlook calendar and email integrated within intranet \n Security \n Enable user or group based security to secure documents and sites throughout the intranet portal \n Customization \n Software that is flexible to allow for organization Web Parts can be used to create custom modules which can make interaction easier with the site Ability for users to customize tools and resources they use most often \n Collaboration \n People are now able to collaborate their work with each other Example would be multiple people working on one document \n Communication Channels \n Allows corporations to promote corporate culture and present information in a more interactive way than before \n Automation \n Things like workflows and templates can automate specific document creation Alerts can be created to help learn of changes and new additions to the intranet \n Applications \n Links to applications for associates to perform duties \n User Friendly \n Application must be easy to use and understand due to a wide range of technical abilities \n Remote Access \n Ability for users to access content away from the office \n Document Repository \n Ability to store and retrieve document information while maintaining regular backups to prevent data loss \n Blog \n Used as a method to provide more timely information to employees customers and business partners \n People Search \n Search enterprise wide for employee information such as contact information specialty areas group membership personal interest etc \n Enterprise Search \n search enterprise content using enterprise search \n Targeted Content \n Business portal administrators can target content by business group area e g HR Marketing Legal Corporate Executives etc \n Advantages \n Intranet portal helps employees make better and more informed decisions which result from increased knowledge It also helps reduce costs saves time increases collaboration increases productivity and effectiveness \n Intranet portal can help employees find information more easily and perform their jobs better though few portal designs are optimal just out-of-the-box In fact especially in smaller companies designers can realize some features found in off-the-shelf portal software through simpler do-it-yourself means Most intranets have become completely unwieldy and present a highly fragmented and confusing user experience with no consistency and little navigational support Portals aim to correct this problem by presenting a single gateway to all corporate information and services One benefit of creating this consistent look and feel is users need less time to learn how to use the environment They also more easily recognize where they are in the portal and where they can gono small feat when navigating a large information space By integrating services and presenting personalized snippets on the initial screen intranet portals also reduce the need for users to browse far and wide to obtain needed information thus making it easier for them to perform their jobs \n Intranet portal is a Web-based tool that allows users to create a customized site that dynamically pulls in Internet activities and desired content into a single page By providing a contextual framework for information portals can bring S&T Science and Technology and organizational \"knowledge\" to the desktop \n Disadvantages \n Intranet Portals can be a large business cost The maintenance and management can be time consuming and expensive Not only is it a cost to keep the portal running but a cost when the system goes offline Most intranets are established to put all an organization's resources into one place and having that offline can force operations to be put on hold \n Security issues can become an ongoing problem Unauthorized access is a concern and can result in users gaining access to sensitive information Denial of access can cause issues for users needing access for their work \n Having everything in one place is only good if it's organized Information overload can make finding information very difficult - lowering productivity \n Activities \n Tools & Resources \n Area for employees to link to or download necessary applications to perform work functions Information also provided to find internal and external resources \n Associate Services \n Business Operations \n To give users access to important business policies and manuals \n Company Calendar \n To give user access to important company event dates

those who \n define \n it According to Barry K Beyer critical thinking means making clear reasoned judgments During the process of critical thinking ideas should be reasoned well thought out and

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed \n November \n Learn how and when to remove this template message \n The ability to reason logically is a fundamental skill of rational agents hence the study of the form of correct argumentation is relevant to the study of critical thinking \n \"First wave\" logical \n thinking \n consisted of understanding the connections between two concepts or points in thought It followed a philosophy where the \n thinker \n was removed from the train of thought and the connections and the analysis of the connect was devoid of any bias of the thinker Kerry Walters describes this ideology in her essay Beyond Logicism in Critical Thinking \"A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal and to a lesser extent formal logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical abstract universal and objective This model of \n thinking \n has become so entrenched in conventional academic wisdom that many educators accept it as canon\" Walters p The adoption of these principals parallel themselves with the increasing reliance on quantitative understanding of the world \n In the second wave of critical thinking as defined by Kerry S Walters Re-thinking Reason p many authors moved away from the logocentric mode of critical thinking that the first wave privileged especially in institutions of higher \n learning \n Walters summarizes logicism as \"the unwarranted assumption that good thinking is reducible to logical thinking\" p \n \"A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal and to a lesser extent formal logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical abstract universal and objective \" Walters p As the second wave took hold scholars began to take a more inclusive view of what constituted as critical thinking Rationality and logic are still widely accepted in many circles as the primary examples of critical thinking \n Inductive versus deductive thinking \n Inductive thinking involves drawing on many different facts concepts or opinions to come to a larger conclusion Examples of inductive reasoning include differential diagnosis inquiry-based education and trial and error Deductive Reasoning involves addressing the known first and attempt to discover more \n information \n about why the known is what it is Examples of deductive reasoning include root cause analysis and top down \n learning \n Critical thinking and rationality \n Kerry S Walters Re-thinking Reason argues that rationality demands more than just logical or traditional methods of problem solving and analysis or what he calls the \"calculus of justification\" but also considers \" \n cognitive \n acts such as \n imagination \n conceptual creativity \n intuition \n and insight\" p These \"functions\" are focused on discovery on more abstract processes instead of linear rules-based approaches to problem solving The linear and non-sequential mind must both be engaged in the \n rational \n mind \n The ability to critically analyze an argument to dissect structure and components thesis and reasons is important But so is the ability to be flexible and consider non-traditional alternatives and perspectives These complementary functions are what allow for critical thinking a practice encompassing imagination and intuition in cooperation with traditional modes of deductive inquiry \n Functions \n The list of core critical thinking skills includes observation interpretation analysis inference evaluation explanation and \n metacognition \n According to Reynolds an individual or group engaged in a strong way of critical thinking gives due consideration to establish for instance \n Evidence through reality \n Context skills to isolate the problem from context \n clarification needed \n Relevant criteria for making the judgment well \n Applicable methods or techniques for forming the judgment \n Applicable theoretical constructs for understanding the problem and the question at hand \n In addition to possessing strong critical-thinking skills one must be disposed to engage problems and decisions using those skills Critical thinking employs not only \n logic \n but broad \n intellectual \n criteria such as clarity \n credibility \n accuracy \n precision \n relevance \n depth \n breadth \n significance and fairness \n Procedure \n Critical thinking calls for the ability to \n Recognize problems to find workable means for meeting those problems \n Understand the importance of prioritization and order of precedence in problem solving \n Gather and marshal pertinent relevant information \n Recognize \n unstated assumptions \n and values \n Comprehend and use \n language \n with accuracy clarity and \n discernment \n Interpret data to appraise evidence and evaluate arguments \n Recognize the existence or non-existence of logical relationships between propositions \n Draw warranted conclusions and generalizations \n Put to test the conclusions and generalizations at which one arrives \n Reconstruct one's patterns of beliefs on the basis of wider experience \n Render accurate judgments about specific things and qualities in everyday life \n In sum \n \"A persistent effort to examine any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the evidence that supports or refutes it and the further conclusions to which it tends \" \n Habits or traits of mind \n The habits of \n mind \n that characterize a person strongly disposed toward critical thinking include a desire to follow reason and evidence wherever they may lead a systematic approach to problem solving \n inquisitiveness \n even-handedness and confidence in \n reasoning \n According to a definition analysis by Kompf & Bond critical thinking involves problem solving decision making \n metacognition \n rationality rational thinking \n reasoning \n knowledge \n intelligence \n and also a moral component such as reflective thinking Critical thinkers therefore need to have reached a level of maturity in their development possess a certain attitude as well as a set of taught skills \n Research \n Edward M Glaser proposed that the ability to think critically involves three elements \n An attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one's experiences \n Knowledge of the methods of logical \n inquiry \n and reasoning \n Some skill in applying those methods \n Educational programs aimed at developing critical thinking in children and adult learners individually or in group problem solving and decision making contexts continue to address these same three central elements \n The Critical Thinking project at Human Science Lab \n London \n is involved in scientific study of all major \n educational system \n in prevalence today to assess how the systems are working to promote or impede critical thinking \n Contemporary cognitive psychology regards human reasoning as a complex process that is both reactive and reflective \n The relationship between critical thinking skills and critical thinking dispositions is an empirical question Some people have both in abundance some have skills but not the disposition to use them some are disposed but lack strong skills and some have neither A measure of critical thinking dispositions is the California Measure of Mental Motivation \n Education \n John Dewey \n is one of many educational leaders who recognized that a curriculum aimed at building thinking skills would benefit the individual learner the community and the entire democracy \n Critical thinking is significant in academics due to being significant in learning Critical thinking is significant in the learning process of \n internalization \n in the construction of basic ideas principles and theories inherent in content And critical thinking is significant in the learning process of application whereby those ideas principles and theories are implemented effectively as they become relevant in learners' lives \n Each discipline adapts its use of critical thinking concepts and principles The core concepts are always there but they are embedded in subject-specific content For students to learn content intellectual engagement is crucial All students must do their own thinking their own construction of knowledge Good teachers recognize this and therefore focus on the questions readings activities that stimulate the mind to take ownership of key concepts and principles underlying the subject \n Historically teaching of critical thinking focused only on logical procedures such as formal and informal logic This emphasized to students that good thinking is equivalent to logical thinking However a second wave of critical thinking urges educators to value conventional techniques meanwhile expanding what it means to be a critical thinker In Kerry Walters \n compiled a conglomeration of sources surpassing this logical restriction to include many different authors research regarding connected knowing empathy gender-sensitive ideals collaboration world views intellectual autonomy morality and enlightenment These concepts invite students to incorporate their own perspectives and experiences into their thinking \n In the English and Welsh school systems \n Critical Thinking \n is offered as a subject that 16- to 18-year-olds can take as an \n A-Level \n Under the \n OCR \n exam board \n students can sit two exam papers for the AS \"Credibility of Evidence\" and \"Assessing and Developing Argument\" The full Advanced \n GCE \n is now available in addition to the two AS units candidates sit the two papers \"Resolution of Dilemmas\" and \"Critical Reasoning\" The A-level tests candidates on their ability to think critically about and analyze arguments on their deductive or inductive validity as well as producing their own arguments It also tests their ability to analyze certain related topics such as credibility and ethical decision-making However due to its comparative lack of subject content many universities do not accept it as a main A-level for admissions \n Nevertheless the AS is often useful in developing reasoning skills and the full Advanced \n GCE \n is useful for degree courses in politics philosophy history or \n theology \n providing the skills required for critical analysis that are useful for example in biblical study \n There used to also be an \n Advanced Extension Award \n offered in Critical Thinking in the UK open to any A-level student regardless of whether they have the Critical Thinking A-level \n Cambridge International Examinations \n have an A-level in Thinking Skills \n From \n Assessment and Qualifications Alliance \n has also been offering an A-level Critical Thinking specification \n OCR \n exam board \n have also modified theirs for Many examinations for university entrance set by universities on top of A-level examinations also include a critical thinking component such as the \n LNAT \n the \n UKCAT \n the \n BioMedical Admissions Test \n and the \n Thinking Skills Assessment \n In \n Qatar \n critical thinking was offered by \n AL-Bairaq \n which is an outreach non-traditional educational program that targets high school students and focuses on a curriculum based on \n STEM fields \n The idea behind \n AL-Bairaq \n is to offer high school students the opportunity to connect with the research environment in the Center for Advanced Materials CAM at Qatar University Faculty members train and mentor the students and help develop and enhance their critical thinking problem-solving and teamwork skills \n not in citation given \n Efficacy \n In a meta-analysis of the literature on teaching effectiveness in higher \n education \n was undertaken \n The study noted concerns from higher \n education \n politicians \n and \n business \n that higher education was failing to meet society's requirements for well-educated citizens It concluded that although faculty may aspire to develop students' \n thinking \n skills in practice they have tended to aim at facts and concepts utilizing lowest levels of \n cognition \n rather than developing intellect or \n values \n In a more recent meta-analysis researchers reviewed quasi- or true-experimental studies all of which used some form of standardized critical thinking measure to assess the outcome variable \n The authors describe the various methodological approaches and attempt to categorize the differing assessment tools which include standardized tests and second-source measures tests developed by teachers tests developed by researchers and tests developed by teachers who also serve the role as the \n researcher \n The results emphasized the need for exposing students to real-world problems and the importance in encouraging open dialogue within a supportive environment Effective strategies for teaching critical thinking are thought to be possible in a wide variety of \n educational \n settings \n Importance in academia \n Critical thinking is an important element of all professional fields and academic disciplines by referencing their respective sets of permissible questions evidence sources criteria etc Within the framework of \n scientific skepticism \n the process of critical thinking involves the careful acquisition and interpretation of information and use of it to reach a \n well-justified \n conclusion The concepts and principles of critical thinking can be applied to any context or case but only by reflecting upon the nature of that application Critical thinking forms therefore a system of related and overlapping modes of thought such as anthropological thinking sociological thinking historical thinking political thinking \n psychological \n thinking philosophical thinking mathematical thinking chemical thinking biological thinking ecological thinking legal thinking ethical thinking musical thinking thinking like a painter sculptor engineer business person etc In other words though critical thinking principles are universal their application to disciplines requires a process of reflective \n contextualization \n Critical thinking is considered important in the academic fields because it enables one to analyze evaluate explain and restructure their thinking thereby decreasing the risk of adopting acting on or thinking with a false belief However even with knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning mistakes can happen due to a thinker's inability to apply the methods or because of character traits such as \n egocentrism \n Critical thinking includes identification of \n prejudice \n bias \n propaganda self-deception distortion \n misinformation \n etc \n Given research in \n cognitive psychology \n some \n educators \n believe that schools should focus on teaching their students critical thinking \n skills \n and cultivation of intellectual traits \n Critical thinking skills can be used to help nurses during the assessment process Through the use of critical thinking nurses can question evaluate and reconstruct the nursing care process by challenging the established theory and practice Critical thinking skills can help nurses problem solve reflect and make a conclusive decision about the current situation they face Critical thinking creates \"new possibilities for the development of the nursing knowledge \" \n Due to the sociocultural environmental and political issues that are affecting healthcare delivery it would be helpful to embody new techniques in nursing Nurses can also engage their critical thinking skills through the Socratic method of dialogue and reflection This practice standard is even part of some regulatory organizations such as the College of Nurses of Ontario - Professional Standards for Continuing Competencies \n It requires nurses to engage in \n Reflective Practice \n and keep records of this continued professional development for possible review by the College \n Critical thinking is also considered important for \n human rights education \n for \n toleration \n The \n Declaration of Principles on Tolerance \n adopted by \n UNESCO \n in affirms that \"education for tolerance could aim at countering factors that lead to fear and exclusion of others and could help young people to develop capacities for independent judgement \n critical thinking \n and ethical \n reasoning \n \" \n Critical thinking is used as a way of deciding whether a claim is true partially true or false It is a tool by which one can come about reasoned conclusions based on a reasoned process \n Critical thinking in computer-mediated communication \n The advent and rising popularity of online courses has prompted some to ask if computer-mediated communication CMC promotes hinders or has no effect on the amount and quality of critical thinking in a course relative to face-to-face communication There is some evidence to suggest a fourth more nuanced possibility that CMC may promote some aspects of critical thinking but hinder others For example Guiller et al \n found that relative to face-to-face discourse online discourse featured more justifications while face-to-face discourse featured more instances of students expanding on what others had said The increase in justifications may be due to the asynchronous nature of online discussions while the increase in expanding comments may be due to the spontaneity of real time discussion Newman et al \n showed similar differential effects They found that while CMC boasted more important statements and linking of ideas it lacked novelty The authors suggest that this may be due to difficulties participating in a brainstorming-style activity in an asynchronous environment Rather the asynchrony may promote users to put forth considered thought out contributions \n Researchers assessing critical thinking in online discussion forums often employ a technique called Content Analysis \n where the text of online discourse or the transcription of face-to-face discourse is systematically coded for different kinds of statements relating to critical thinking For example a statement might be coded as Discuss ambiguities to clear them up or Welcoming outside knowledge as positive indicators of critical thinking Conversely statements reflecting poor critical thinking may be labeled as Sticking to prejudice or assumptions or Squashing attempts to bring in outside knowledge The frequency of these codes in CMC and face-to-face discourse can be compared to draw conclusions about the quality of critical thinking \n Searching for evidence of critical thinking in discourse has roots in a definition of critical thinking put forth by Kuhn \n which places more emphasis on the social nature of discussion and knowledge construction There is limited research on the role of social experience in critical thinking development but there is some evidence to suggest it is an important factor For example research has shown that 3- to 4-year-old children can discern to some extent the differential creditability \n and expertise \n of individuals Further evidence for the impact of social experience on the development of critical thinking skills comes from work that found that 6- to 7-year-olds from China have similar levels of skepticism to 10- and 11-year-olds in the United States \n If the development of critical thinking skills was solely due to maturation it is unlikely we would see such dramatic differences across cultures \n Logic portal \n Global Critical Thinking Project \n Cognitive bias mitigation \n Critical theory \n Demarcation problem \n Dialectic \n Discourse

organizational development \n OD and in \n consensus decision-making \n refers to the process of designing and running a successful \n meeting \n Facilitation concerns itself with all the tasks needed to run a \n productive \n and impartial meeting Facilitation serves the needs of any group who are meeting with a common purpose whether it be making a decision solving a problem or simply exchanging ideas and information It does not \n lead \n the group nor does it try to distract or to entertain A slightly different interpretation focuses more specifically on a group that is engaged in \n experiential learning \n In particular this is associated with \n active learning \n and concepts of \n tutelary \n authority This is covered in-depth in the research work of \n John Heron \n at the \n University of Surrey \n and the International Centre for \n Co-operative Inquiry \n Aspects of facilitation \n The role of the facilitator \n The form of meeting \n Aspects of facilitation \n The role of the \n facilitator \n see below \n The role of facilitator only emerged as a separate set of skills in the 1980s It has similarities to the traditional \n Chair \n or \n secretary \n roles in a meeting but goes beyond them to actively participate and guide the group towards \n consensus \n Setting ground rules \n Often disregarded by those untrained in facilitation setting ground rules is a key component of the facilitation process especially in meetings convened to discuss difficult problems or for training These rules are usually reiterated in some form at the outset of a facilitated meeting or workshop to ensure participants understand the various roles being employed and the responsibilities accorded to each Certain aspects feature highly such as \n being open to suggestions \n building on what is there not knocking down ideas \n allowing others space to speak or express themselves \n mutual respect \n that the facilitator does not own the topic under discussion and the identity of that owner is clear \n rules of engagement such as time-outs and procedures that will be adopted \n how unresolved issues will be captured and dealt with \n Finally it is key that during the meeting it is clear that the owner of the topic is not expected to intervene to impose ideas beyond setting out parameters for consideration or to give insight The facilitator in this respect owns the process of the meeting \n These are all closely associated with the idea of facilitation as a tool of workplace \n empowerment \n Consulting with the client \n A facilitator will work with a client who is someone in an organisation or diverse group who is calling them and has invited the facilitator to assist They will try to understand the purpose and outcome of the meeting by discussing it with the client \n Making arrangements for the \n meeting \n The practical arrangements will be arranged or managed by the facilitator They will also consider in detail the location and layout of the room They will research the meeting beforehand to understand why it is being held and that all \n stakeholders \n are invited and able to attend \n Setting the \n agenda \n They will understand in detail how each item on the agenda is to be tackled and how long it should take Using specialist techniques they will allow participants to understand all the issues at stake and all alternative courses of action The Facilitator designs the process agenda based on his or her discussions with the participants and the Facilitator's process expertise \n Understanding group \n norms \n They will not make assumptions about the way people interact and will try to adapt to the ways of different cultures and organisations \n Understanding \n group dynamics \n Whilst tackling the practical aspects of a meeting they remain aware of undercurrents both verbal and non-verbal which may indicate problems the group is having The facilitator may try to assist the group in becoming aware of these \n The role of the facilitator \n See the \n facilitator \n article for details of exactly how a facilitator might run a meeting \n It is important to note that the tasks and responsibilities listed below do not need to be covered by a single facilitator The role of the facilitator is often shared by multiple people for instance one person may arrange the logistics before the meeting another person may keep time and monitor the agenda during the meeting and a third person may be responsible for recording agreements \n Prior to a meeting facilitators \n research the meeting \n find out the purpose and goal if any of the meeting \n establish who needs to attend \n draw up a draft agenda and design the group processes to attain the necessary results \n share the agenda with potential attendees changing it as necessary \n ensure everyone gets fully briefed for the meeting and that everyone knows the purpose and potential consequences of the meeting \n During the meeting facilitators \n monitor the agenda \n keep time \n manage the group process \n encourage participation from all attendees \n help participants understand different points of view \n foster solutions that incorporate diverse points of view \n manage participant behaviour \n create a safe environment \n teach new thinking skills and facilitate structured thinking activities \n record with an agreed phraseology agreements They may also note unresolved issues for later debate \n The facilitator may write up and publish the results of the meeting to everyone concerned including those who could not attend \n The form of meeting \n A meeting usually means everyone is together in the same room at the same time and this is the major situation in which facilitation is practiced With the introduction of modern telecommunications the field has grown to embrace other forms of meetings \n Same time same place \n The traditional meeting in a room with all parties present at the same time \n Same time different place \n The teleconference with either all parties at separate locations or with some in geographically dispersed sub meetings all with audio / video connection \n Different time same place \n A meeting focussing on a particular physical location where people contribute as they pass by A wall mounted notice board and/or poster display which allows individuals to add comments as they pass is one example A survey using un-networked computers in a kiosk would also be a \"different time same place\" meeting \n Different time different place \n Meeting via a web link such as discussion groups

One of the earliest definitions of collaborative software is \"intentional group processes plus software to support them\" \n Collaborative software is a broad concept that overlaps considerably with \n computer-supported cooperative work \n CSCW According to Carstensen and Schmidt \n groupware is part of CSCW The authors claim that CSCW and thereby groupware addresses \"how collaborative

software relates to the notion of \n collaborative work systems \n which are conceived as any form of human organization that emerges any time that collaboration takes place whether it is formal or informal intentional or unintentional \n Whereas the groupware or collaborative software pertains to the technological elements of computer-supported cooperative work collaborative work systems become

vision in \n with \n working prototypes \n in full operational use by his research team by the mid-1960s \n and held the first public demonstration of his work in in what is now referred to as \" \n The Mother of All Demos \n \" \n The following year Engelbart's lab was hooked into the \n ARPANET \n the first computer network enabling them to extend services to a broader userbase See also \n Intelligence Amplification \n Section Douglas Engelbart \n ARPANET \n Section on \n ARPANET Deployed \n and the Doug Engelbart Archive Collection \n Online collaborative gaming software began between early networked computer users In \n Will Crowther \n created \n Colossal Cave Adventure \n on a \n DEC PDP-10 \n computer As internet connections grew so did the numbers of users and multi-user games In \n Roy Trubshaw \n a student at Essex University in the United Kingdom created the game MUD Multi-User Dungeon \n The US Government began using truly collaborative applications in the early 1990s \n One of the first robust applications was the Navy's Common Operational Modeling Planning and Simulation Strategy COMPASS \n The COMPASS system allowed up to users created point-to-point connections with one another the collaborative session only remained while at least one user stayed active and would have to be recreated if all six logged out MITRE improved on that model by hosting the collaborative session on a server that each user logged into Called the Collaborative Virtual Workstation CVW this allowed the session to be set up in a virtual file cabinet and virtual rooms and left as a persistent session that could be joined later \n In \n Pavel Curtis \n who had built MUDs at \n PARC \n created PlaceWare a server that simulated a one-to-many auditorium with side chat between \"seat-mates\" and the ability to invite a limited number of audience members to speak In engineers at \n GTE \n used the PlaceWare engine in a commercial version of MITRE's CVW calling it InfoWorkSpace IWS In IWS was chosen as the military standard for the standardized Air Operations Center \n The IWS product was sold to \n General Dynamics \n and then later to Ezenia \n Groupware \n Collaborative software was originally designated as \n groupware \n and this term can be traced as far back as the late 1980s when Richman and Slovak \n wrote \n \"Like an electronic sinew that binds teams together the new \n groupware \n aims to place the computer squarely in the middle of communications among managers technicians and anyone else who interacts in groups revolutionizing the way they work \" \n Even further back in Peter and Trudy Johnson-Lenz coined the term groupware their initial definition of groupware was intentional group processes plus software to support them Later in their article they went on to explain groupware as computer-mediated culture an embodiment of social organization in hyperspace \" Groupware integrates co-evolving human and tool systems yet is simply a single system \n In the early 1990s the first commercial groupware products were delivered and big companies such as \n Boeing \n and \n IBM \n started using electronic meeting systems for key internal projects \n Lotus Notes \n appeared as a major example of that product category allowing remote group collaboration when the internet was still in its infancy Kirkpatrick and Losee \n wrote then \n \"If GROUPWARE really makes a difference in productivity long term the very definition of an office may change You will be able to work efficiently as a member of a group wherever you have your computer As computers become smaller and more powerful that will mean anywhere \" \n Design and implementation issues \n The complexity of groupware development is still an issue One reason for this is the socio-technical dimension of groupware Groupware designers do not only have to address technical issues as in traditional software development but also consider the organizational aspects \n and the social group processes that should be supported with the groupware application Some examples for issues in groupware development are \n Persistence is needed in some sessions Chat and voice communications are routinely non-persistent and evaporate at the end of the session Virtual room and online file cabinets can persist for years The designer of the collaborative space needs to consider the information duration needs and implement accordingly \n Authentication has always been a problem with groupware When connections are made point-to-point or when log-in registration is enforced it's clear who is engaged in the session However audio and unmoderated sessions carry the risk of unannounced 'lurkers' who observe but do not announce themselves or contribute \n Until recently bandwidth issues at fixed location limited full use of the tools These are exacerbated with mobile devices \n Multiple input and output streams bring concurrency issues into the groupware applications \n Motivational issues are important especially in settings where no pre-defined group process was in place \n Closely related to the motivation aspect is the question of reciprocity \n Ellis \n and others \n have shown that the distribution of efforts and benefits has to be carefully balanced in order to ensure that all required group members really participate \n One approach for addressing these issues is the use of design patterns for groupware design \n The patterns identify recurring groupware design issues and discuss design choices in a way that all stakeholders can participate in the groupware development process \n Groupware and levels of collaboration \n Groupware can be divided into three categories depending on the level of \n collaboration \n Communication \n can be thought of as unstructured interchange of information A phone call or an \n IM \n Chat discussion are examples of this \n Conferencing \n or collaboration level as it is called in the academic papers that discuss these levels refers to interactive work toward a shared goal Brainstorming or voting are examples of this \n Co-ordination \n refers to complex interdependent work toward a shared goal A good metaphor for understanding this is to think about a sports team everyone has to contribute the right play at the right time as well as adjust their play to the unfolding situation - but everyone is doing something different - in order for the team to win That is complex interdependent work toward a shared goal collaborative management \n Collaborative management coordination tools \n Collaborative management tools facilitate and manage group activities Examples include \n Electronic calendars \n also called \n time management \n software schedule events and automatically notify and remind group members \n Project management \n systems schedule track and chart the steps in a project as it is being completed \n Online proofing \n share review approve and reject web proofs artwork photos or videos between designers customers and clients \n Workflow systems \n collaborative management of tasks and documents within a knowledge-based business process \n Knowledge management systems \n collect organize manage and share various forms of information \n Enterprise bookmarking \n collaborative bookmarking engine to tag organize share and search enterprise data \n Prediction markets \n let a group of people predict together the outcome of future events \n Extranet \n systems sometimes also known as 'project extranets' collect organize manage and share information associated with the delivery of a project e g the construction of a building \n Intranet \n systems quickly share company information to members within a company via Internet e g marketing and product info \n Social software \n systems organize social relations of groups \n Online spreadsheets \n collaborate and share structured data and information \n Client portals \n interact and share with your clients in a private online environment \n citation needed \n Collaborative software and human interaction \n The design intent of collaborative software groupware is to transform the way documents and \n rich media \n are shared in order to enable more effective team collaboration \n Collaboration with respect to information technology seems to have several definitions Some are defensible but others are so broad they lose any meaningful application Understanding the differences in human interactions is necessary to ensure the appropriate technologies are employed to meet interaction needs \n There are three primary ways in which humans interact conversations transactions and collaborations \n Conversational interaction \n is an exchange of information between two or more participants where the primary purpose of the interaction is discovery or relationship building There is no central entity around which the interaction revolves but is a free exchange of information with no defined constraints generally focused on personal experiences \n Communication technology such as telephones \n instant messaging \n and e-mail are generally sufficient for conversational interactions \n Transactional interaction \n involves the exchange of transaction entities where a major function of the transaction entity is to alter the relationship between participants \n In \n collaborative interactions \n the main function of the participants' relationship is to alter a collaboration entity i e the converse of transactional \n Collaboration

Search Assistant \n the CSE of Burghardt et al \n and the works of Longo et al \n all represent examples of implicit collaboration Systems that fall under this category identify similar users queries and links clicked automatically and recommend related queries and links to the searchers \n Explicit collaboration means that users share an agreed-upon information need and work together toward that goal For example in a chat-like application query terms and links clicked are automatically exchanged The most prominent example of this class is SearchTogether \n published in SearchTogether offers an interface that combines search results from standard search engines and a chat to exchange queries and links Reddy et al \n follow a similar approach and compares two implementations of their CSE called MUSE and MUST Reddy et al focuses on the role of communication required for efficient CSEs Representatives for the class of implicit collaboration are I-Spy \n the Community Search Assistant \n and the CSE of Burghardt et al \n Cerciamo \n supports explicit collaboration by allowing one person to concentrate on finding promising groups of documents while having the other person make in-depth

histories of users to a hybrid CSE \n Community of practice \n Recent work in collaborative filtering and information retrieval has shown that sharing of search experiences among users having similar interests typically called a \n community of practice \n or \n community of interest \n reduces the effort put in by a given user in retrieving the exact information of interest \n Collaborative search deployed within a community of practice deploys novel techniques for exploiting context during search by indexing and ranking search results based on the learned preferences of a community of users \n The users benefit by sharing information experiences and awareness to personalize result-lists to reflect the preferences of the community as a whole The community representing a group of

collaboration \n Privacy-aware collaborative search engines \n Search terms and links clicked that are shared among users reveal their interests habits social relations and intentions \n In other words CSEs put the privacy of the users at risk Studies have shown that CSEs increase efficiency \n Unfortunately by the lack of privacy enhancing technologies a privacy aware user who wants to benefit from a CSE has to disclose his entire search log Note even when explicitly sharing queries and links clicked the whole former log is disclosed to any user that joins a search session Thus sophisticated mechanisms that allow on a more fine grained level which information is disclosed to whom are desirable \n As CSEs are a new technology just entering the market identifying user privacy preferences and integrating \n Privacy enhancing technologies \n PETs into collaborative search are in conflict On one hand PETs have to meet user preferences on the other hand one cannot identify these preferences without using a CSE i e implementing PETs into CSEs Today the only work addressing this problem comes from Burghardt et al \n They implemented a CSE with experts from the information

\n discrete differential geometry \n The design of \n geometric models \n for object shapes in particular is occasionally called \n computer-aided geometric design \n CAGD \n Overview of CAD software \n Uses \n Types \n Technology \n Software \n Overview of CAD software \n Starting around the mid 1970s as computer aided design systems began to provide more capability than just an ability to reproduce manual drafting with electronic drafting the cost benefit for companies to switch to CAD became apparent The benefits of CAD systems over manual drafting are the capabilities one often takes for granted from computer systems today automated generation of \n Bill of Material \n auto layout in \n integrated circuits \n interference checking and many others Eventually CAD provided the designer with the ability to perform engineering calculations During this transition calculations were still performed either by hand or by those individuals who could run computer programs CAD was a revolutionary change in the engineering industry where draftsmen designers and engineering roles begin to merge It did not eliminate departments as much as it merged departments and empowered draftsman designers and engineers CAD is just another example of the pervasive effect computers were beginning to have on industry Current computer-aided design software packages range from 2D \n vector \n -based drafting systems to 3D \n solid \n and \n surface \n modelers Modern CAD packages can also frequently allow rotations in three dimensions allowing viewing of a designed object from any desired angle even from the inside looking out Some CAD software is capable of dynamic mathematical modeling in which case it may be marketed as CAD \n CAD technology is used in the design of tools and machinery and in the drafting and design of all types of buildings from small residential types houses to the largest commercial and industrial structures hospitals and factories \n CAD is mainly used for detailed engineering of 3D models and/or 2D drawings of physical components but it is also used throughout the engineering process from conceptual design and layout of products through strength and dynamic analysis of assemblies to definition of manufacturing methods of components It can also be used to design objects Furthermore many CAD applications now offer advanced rendering and animation capabilities so engineers can better visualize their product designs \n 4D BIM \n is a type of virtual construction engineering simulation incorporating time or schedule related information for project management \n CAD has become an especially important technology within the scope of \n computer-aided technologies \n with benefits such as lower product development costs and a greatly shortened design cycle CAD enables designers to layout and develop work on screen print it out and save it for future editing saving time on their drawings \n Uses \n Computer-aided design is one of the many tools used by engineers and designers and is used in many ways depending on the profession of the user and the type of software in question \n CAD is one part of the whole Digital Product Development DPD activity within the \n Product Lifecycle Management \n PLM processes and as such is used together with other tools which are either integrated modules or stand-alone products such as \n Computer-aided engineering \n CAE and \n Finite element analysis \n FEA \n Computer-aided manufacturing \n CAM including instructions to \n Computer Numerical Control \n CNC machines \n Photorealistic rendering \n and Motion Simulation \n Document management and \n revision control \n using \n Product Data Management \n PDM \n CAD is also used for the accurate creation of photo simulations that are often required in the preparation of Environmental Impact Reports in which computer-aided designs of intended buildings are superimposed into photographs of existing environments to represent what that locale will be like where the proposed facilities are allowed to be built Potential blockage of view corridors and shadow studies are also frequently analyzed through the use of CAD \n CAD has been proven to be useful to engineers as well Using four properties which are history features parameterization and high level constraints The construction history can be used to look back into the model's personal features and work on the single area rather than the whole model Parameters and constraints can be used to determine the size shape and other properties of the different modeling elements The features in the CAD system can be used for the variety of tools for measurement such as tensile strength yield strength electrical or electro-magnetic properties Also its stress strain \n timing \n or how the element gets affected in certain temperatures etc \n Types \n A simple procedure \n Comparison of computer-aided design editors \n There are several different types of CAD \n each requiring the operator to think differently about how to use them and design their virtual components in a different manner for each \n There are many producers of the lower-end 2D systems including a number of free and open source programs These provide an approach to the drawing process without all the fuss over scale and placement on the drawing sheet that accompanied hand drafting since these can be adjusted as required during the creation of the final draft \n 3D \n wireframe \n is basically an extension of 2D drafting not often used today Each line has to be manually inserted into the drawing The final product has no mass properties associated with it and cannot have features directly added to it such as holes The operator approaches these in a similar fashion to the 2D systems although many 3D systems allow using the wireframe model to make the final engineering drawing views \n 3D \"dumb\" solids \n are created in a way analogous to manipulations of real world objects not often used today Basic three-dimensional geometric forms prisms cylinders spheres and so on have solid volumes added or subtracted from them as if assembling or cutting real-world objects Two-dimensional projected views can easily be generated from the models Basic 3D solids don't usually include tools to easily allow motion of components set limits to their motion or identify interference between components \n There are two types of \n 3D Solid Modeling \n Parametric modeling \n allows the operator to use what is referred to as \"design intent\" The objects and features created are modifiable Any future modifications can be made by changing how the original part was created If a feature was intended to be located from the center of the part the operator should locate it from the center of the model The feature could be located using any geometric object already available in the part but this random placement would defeat the design intent If the operator designs the part as it functions the parametric modeler is able to make changes to the part while maintaining geometric and functional relationships \n Direct or Explicit modeling \n provide the ability to edit geometry without a history tree With direct modeling once a sketch is used to create geometry the sketch is incorporated into the new geometry and the designer just modifies the geometry without needing the original sketch As with parametric modeling \n direct modeling \n has the ability to include relationships between selected geometry e g tangency concentricity \n Top end systems offer the capabilities to incorporate more organic aesthetics and ergonomic features into designs \n Freeform surface modeling \n is often combined with solids to allow the designer to create products that fit the human form and visual requirements as well as they interface with the machine \n Technology \n A CAD model of a \n computer mouse \n Originally software for Computer-Aided Design systems was developed with computer languages such as \n Fortran \n ALGOL \n but with the advancement of \n object-oriented programming \n methods this has radically changed Typical modern \n parametric feature based modeler \n and \n freeform surface \n systems are built around a number of key \n C \n modules with their own \n APIs \n A CAD system can be seen as built up from the interaction of a \n graphical user interface \n GUI with \n NURBS \n geometry and/or \n boundary representation \n B-rep data via a \n geometric modeling kernel \n A geometry constraint engine may also be employed to manage the associative relationships between geometry such as wireframe geometry in a sketch or components in an assembly \n Unexpected capabilities of these associative relationships have led to a new form of \n prototyping \n called \n digital prototyping \n In contrast to physical prototypes which entail manufacturing time in the design That said CAD models can be generated by a computer after the physical prototype has been scanned using an \n industrial CT scanning \n machine Depending on the nature of the business digital or physical prototypes can be initially chosen according to specific needs \n Today CAD systems exist for all the major platforms \n Windows \n Linux \n UNIX \n and \n Mac OS X \n some packages even support multiple platforms \n Right now no special hardware is required for most CAD software However some CAD systems can do graphically and computationally intensive tasks so a modern \n graphics card \n high speed and possibly multiple \n CPUs \n and large amounts of \n RAM \n may be recommended \n The human-machine interface is generally via a \n computer mouse \n but can also be via a pen and digitizing \n graphics tablet \n Manipulation of the view of the model on the screen is also sometimes done with the use of a \n Spacemouse/SpaceBall \n Some systems also support stereoscopic glasses for \n viewing the 3D model \n Technologies which in the past were limited to larger installations or specialist applications have become available to a wide group of users These include the \n CAVE \n or \n HMD`s \n and interactive \n devices \n like motion-sensing \n technology \n Software \n CAD software enables engineers and architects to design inspect and manage engineering projects within an integrated \n graphical user interface \n GUI on a

Examples of problems being solved in the mid-1940s to 50s include Servo motors controlled by generated pulse The digital computer with built-in compute operations to automatically co-ordinate transforms to compute radar related vectors and the essentially graphic mathematical process of forming a shape with a digital machine tool \n These were accomplished with the use of computer software The man credited with coining the term CAD \n Douglas T Ross \n stated \"As soon as I saw the interactive display equipment \" being used by radar operators it would be just what his data reduction group needed With the Lincoln Lab people they were the only ones who used the big complex display systems put in for the pre-SAGE Cape Cod system But \"we used it for our own personal workstation \" \n The designers of these very early computers built utility programs so that programmers could debug programs using flow charts on a display scope with logical switches that could be opened and closed during the debugging session They found that they could create electronic symbols and geometric figures to be used to create simple circuit diagrams and flow charts \n They made the pleasant discovery that an object once drawn could be reproduced at will its orientation Linkage \n flux \n mechanical \n lexical scoping \n or scale changed This suggested numerous possibilities to them It took ten years of interdisciplinary development \n work before SKETCHPAD sitting on evolving math libraries emerged from MIT's labs Additional developments were carried out in the 1960s within the aircraft automotive industrial control and electronics industries in the area of 3D surface construction NC programming and design analysis most of it independent of one another and often not publicly published until much later Some of the mathematical description work on curves was developed in the early 1940s by Robert Issac Newton from Pawtucket Rhode Island \n Robert A Heinlein \n in his novel \n The Door into Summer \n suggested the possibility of a robotic \n Drafting Dan \n However probably the most important work on polynomial curves and sculptured surface was done by \n Pierre Bzier \n Paul de Casteljau \n Citroen \n Steven Anson Coons \n MIT \n Ford \n James Ferguson \n Boeing \n Carl de Boor \n GM \n Birkhoff GM and Garibedian GM in the 1960s and W Gordon GM and R Riesenfeld in the 1970s \n The invention of the 3D CAD/CAM is attributed to a French engineer \n Pierre Bezier \n Arts et Mtiers ParisTech \n Renault After his mathematical work concerning surfaces he developed \n UNISURF \n between and to ease the design of parts and tools for the automotive industry Then UNISURF became the working base for the following generations of CAD software \n It is argued that a turning point was the development of the \n SKETCHPAD \n system at \n MIT \n by \n Ivan Sutherland \n who later created a graphics technology company with Dr David Evans The distinctive feature of SKETCHPAD was that it allowed the designer to interact with his computer graphically the design can be fed into the computer by drawing on a \n CRT \n monitor \n with a \n light pen \n Effectively it was a prototype of \n graphical user interface \n an indispensable feature of modern CAD Sutherland presented his paper Sketchpad A Man-Machine Graphical Communication System in at a \n Joint Computer Conference \n having worked on it as his PhD thesis paper for a few years Quoting \"For drawings where motion of the drawing or analysis of a drawn problem is of value to the user Sketchpad excels For highly repetitive drawings or drawings where accuracy is required Sketchpad is sufficiently faster than conventional techniques to be worthwhile For drawings which merely communicate with shops it is probably better to use conventional paper and pencil \" Over time efforts would be directed toward the goal of having the \n designers drawings communicate \n not just with shops but with the \n shop tool \n itself This goal would be a long time arriving \n The first commercial applications of CAD were in large companies in the automotive and aerospace industries as well as in electronics Only large corporations could afford the computers capable of performing the calculations Notable company projects were a joint project of \n GM \n Dr Patrick J Hanratty and \n IBM \n Sam Matsa \n Doug Ross's \n MIT \n APT research assistant to develop a prototype system for design engineers \n DAC-1 \n Design Augmented by Computer \n Lockheed \n projects \n Bell \n GRAPHIC and \n Renault \n One of the most influential events in the development of CAD was the founding of MCS Manufacturing and Consulting Services Inc in by Dr P J Hanratty \n who wrote the system ADAM Automated Drafting And Machining but more importantly supplied code to companies such as \n McDonnell Douglas \n Unigraphics \n Computervision \n CADDS \n Calma \n Gerber \n Autotrol \n and \n Control Data \n As computers became more affordable the application areas have gradually expanded The development of CAD software for personal desktop computers was the impetus for almost universal application in all areas of construction \n Other key points in the 1960s and 1970s would be the foundation of CAD systems \n United Computing \n Intergraph \n IBM \n Intergraph IGDS in which led to \n Bentley Systems \n MicroStation \n in \n CAD implementations have evolved dramatically since then Initially with 3D in the 1970s it was typically limited to producing drawings similar to hand-drafted drawings Advances in programming and computer hardware \n notably solid modeling in the 1980s have allowed more versatile applications of computers in design activities \n Key products for were the solid modelling packages - \n Romulus \n ShapeData and Uni-Solid Unigraphics based on PADL-2 and the release of the surface modeler \n CATIA \n Dassault Systemes \n Autodesk was founded by John Walker which led to the 2D system \n AutoCAD \n The next milestone was the release of \n Pro/ENGINEER \n in which heralded greater usage of feature-based modeling methods and parametric linking of the parameters of features Also of importance to the development of CAD was the development of the B-rep solid modeling kernels engines for manipulating geometrically and topologically consistent 3D objects \n Parasolid \n ShapeData and \n ACIS \n Spatial Technology Inc at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s both inspired by the work of Ian Braid This led to the release of mid-range packages

Requesters \n Participation in crowdsourcing \n Limitations and controversies \n Impact of crowdsourcing on product quality \n Entrepreneurs contribute less capital themselves \n Increased number of funded ideas \n Concerns \n Irresponsible crowdsourcing \n Definitions \n The term \"crowdsourcing\" was coined in by Jeff Howe and Mark Robinson editors at \n Wired \n to describe how businesses were using the Internet to \"outsource work to the crowd\" \n which quickly led to the \n portmanteau \n \"crowdsourcing \" Howe first published a definition for the term crowdsourcing in a companion blog post to his June \n Wired \n article \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing\" which came out in print just days later \n \"Simply defined crowdsourcing represents the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined and generally large network of people in the form of an open call This can take the form of peer-production when the job is performed collaboratively but is also often undertaken by sole individuals The crucial prerequisite is the use of the open call format and the large network of potential laborers \" \n In a February article Daren C Brabham \"the first person to publish scholarly research using the word crowdsourcing\" and writer of the book \n Crowdsourcing \n defined it as an \"online distributed problem-solving and production model \" \n After studying more than definitions of crowdsourcing in the scientific and popular literature Enrique Estells-Arolas and Fernando Gonzlez Ladrn-de-Guevara researchers at the Technical University of Valencia developed a new integrating definition \n \"Crowdsourcing is a type of participative online activity in which an individual an institution a nonprofit organization or company proposes to a group of individuals of varying knowledge heterogeneity and number via a flexible open call the voluntary undertaking of a task The undertaking of the task of variable complexity and modularity and in which the crowd should participate bringing their work money knowledge ** and/or ** experience always entails mutual benefit The user will receive the satisfaction of a given type of need be it economic social recognition self-esteem or the development of individual skills while the crowdsourcer will obtain and use to their advantage that which the user has brought to the venture whose form will depend on the type of activity undertaken\" \n As mentioned by the definitions of Brabham and Estells-Arolas and Ladrn-de-Guevara above crowdsourcing in the modern conception is an IT-mediated phenomenon meaning that a form of IT is always used to create and access crowds of people \n In this respect crowdsourcing has been considered to encompass three separate but stable techniques competition crowdsourcing virtual labor market crowdsourcing and open collaboration crowdsourcing \n Henk van Ess a college lecturer in online communications emphasizes the need to \"give back\" the crowdsourced results to the public on ethical grounds His nonscientific noncommercial definition is widely cited in the popular press \n \"Crowdsourcing is channeling the experts desire to solve a problem and then freely sharing the answer with everyone \" \n Despite the multiplicity of definitions for crowdsourcing one constant has been the broadcasting of problems to the public and an open call for contributions to help solve the problem Members of the public submit solutions that are then owned by the entity which originally broadcast the problem In some cases the contributor of the solution is compensated monetarily with prizes or with recognition In other cases the only rewards may be a kudos or intellectual satisfaction Crowdsourcing may produce solutions from \n amateurs \n or \n volunteers \n working in their spare time or from experts or small businesses which were previously unknown to the initiating organization \n Another consequence of the multiple definitions is the \n controversy \n surrounding what kinds of activities that may be considered crowdsourcing \n Historical examples \n While the term \"crowdsourcing\" was popularized on the Internet to describe Internet-based activities \n some examples of projects in retrospect can be described as crowdsourcing \n Timeline of major events \n A brief timeline of events prior to \n The \n Longitude Prize \n When the British government was trying to find a way to measure a ships longitudinal position they offered the public a monetary prize to whomever came up with the best solution \n King Louis XVI \n offered an award to the person who could make the alkali by decomposing sea salt by the simplest and most economic method \n Matthew Fontaine Maury \n distributed copies of his \n Wind and Current Charts \n free of charge on the condition that sailors returned a standardized log of their voyage to the U S Naval Observatory By he had distributed copies free of charge on the same conditions \n Publication of the \n Oxford English Dictionary \n volunteers catalogued words to create the first fascicle of the OED \n Planters \n Peanuts contest The \n Mr Peanut \n logo was designed by a 14-year-old boy who won the Planter Peanuts logo contest \n Jrn Utzon \n winner of the design competition for the \n Sydney Opera House \n French amateur photo contest Ctait Paris en This Was Paris in sponsored by the city of \n Paris \n France-Inter \n radio and the \n Fnac \n photographers produced black-and-white prints and color slides of the French capital to document the architectural changes of Paris Photographs were donated to the \n Bibliothque historique de la ville de Paris \n 'Manthan' movie directed by Shyam Benegal about the story of Amul brand was funded by farmers who contributed Rs each \n The \n Hollywood Stock Exchange \n was founded Allowed for the buying and selling of shares \n British rock band \n Marillion \n raised $60 from their fans to help finance their U S tour \n JustGiving \n established This online platform allows the public to help raise money for charities \n UNV Online Volunteering service launched Connecting people who commit their time and skills over the Internet to help organizations address development challenges \n iStockPhoto \n was founded The free stock imagery website allows the public to contribute to and receive commission for their contributions \n Launch of \n Wikipedia \n Free-access free content Internet encyclopedia \n Toyota \n s first \"Dream car art\" contest Children were asked globally to draw their dream car of the future \n Kodak \n s \"Go for the Gold\" contest Kodak asked anyone to submit a picture of a personal victory \n Jeff Howe coined the term crowdsourcing in \n Wired \n Waze \n a community-oriented \n GPS \n app allows for users to submit road info and route data based on location such as reports of \n car accidents \n or \n traffic \n and integrates that data into its routing algorithms for all users of the app \n Early competitions \n Crowdsourcing has often been used in the past as a competition to discover a solution The French government proposed several of these competitions often rewarded with \n Montyon Prizes \n created for poor Frenchmen who had done virtuous acts \n These included the \n Leblanc process \n or the Alkali prize where a reward was provided for separating the salt from the alkali and the \n Fourneyron's turbine \n when the first hydraulic commercial turbine was developed \n In response to a challenge from the French government \n Nicolas Appert \n won a prize for inventing a new way of food preservation that involved sealing food in air-tight jars \n The British government provided a similar reward to find an easy way to determine a ship's \n longitude \n in \n the Longitude Prize \n During the Great Depression out-of-work clerks tabulated higher mathematical functions in the \n Mathematical Tables Project \n as an outreach project \n One of the biggest crowdsourcing campaigns was a public design contest in hosted by the Indian government's finance ministry to create a symbol for the \n Indian rupee \n Thousands of people sent in entries before the government zeroed in on the final symbol based on the \n Devanagari \n script using the letter Ra \n In astronomy \n Crowdsourcing in astronomy was used in the early 19th century by astronomer \n Denison Olmsted \n After being awakened in a late November night due to a \n meteor shower \n taking place Olmsted noticed a pattern in the shooting stars Olmsted wrote a brief report of this meteor shower in the local newspaper As the cause of Falling Stars is not understood by meteorologists it is desirable to collect all the facts attending this phenomenon stated with as much precision as possible Olmsted wrote to readers in a report subsequently picked up and pooled to newspapers nationwide Responses came pouring in from many states along with scientists observations sent to the \n American Journal of Science and Arts \n These responses helped him make a series of scientific breakthroughs the major discovery being that meteor showers are seen nationwide and fall from space under the influence of gravity Also they demonstrated that the showers appeared in yearly cycles a fact that often eluded scientists The responses allowed him to suggest a velocity for the meteors although his estimate turned out to be too conservative If he had just taken the responses as presented his conjecture on the meteors' velocity would have been closer to their actual speed \n A more recent version of crowdsourcing in astronomy is NASA's photo organizing project \n which asks internet users to browse photos taken from space and try to identify the location the picture is documenting \n In energy system research \n Energy system models \n require large and diverse \n datasets \n increasingly so given the trend towards greater temporal and spatial resolution \n In response there have been several initiatives to crowdsource this data Launched in December \n OpenEI \n is a \n collaborative \n website \n run by the US government providing \n open \n energy data \n While much of its information is from US government sources the platform also seeks crowdsourced input from around the world \n The \n semantic \n wiki \n and \n database \n Enipedia also publishes energy systems data using the concept of crowdsourced \n open \n information Enipedia went public in March \n In genealogy research \n Genealogical \n research was using crowdsourcing techniques long before personal computers were common Beginning in members of \n The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \n encouraged members to submit information about their ancestors The submitted information was gathered together into a single collection In to encourage more people to participate in gathering genealogical information about their ancestors the church started the three-generation program In this program church members were asked to prepare documented family group record forms for the first three generations The program was later expanded to encourage members to research at least four generations and became known as the four-generation program \n Institutes that have records of interest to genealogical research have used crowds of volunteers to create catalogs and indices to records \n In genetic genealogy research \n Genetic genealogy \n is a combination of traditional genealogy with \n genetics \n The rise of personal DNA testing after the turn of the century by companies such as \n Gene by Gene \n FTDNA \n GeneTree \n 23andMe \n and \n Ancestry com \n has led to public and semipublic databases of DNA testing which uses crowdsourcing techniques In recent years \n citizen science \n projects have become increasingly focused providing benefits to scientific research \n This includes support organization and dissemination of \n personal DNA genetic testing \n Similar to \n amateur astronomy \n citizen scientists encouraged by volunteer organizations like the \n International Society of Genetic Genealogy \n have provided valuable information and research to the professional scientific community \n Spencer Wells \n director of the \n Genographic Project \n blurb \n Since the Genographic Project has used the latest genetic technology to expand our knowledge of the human story and its pioneering use of \n DNA \n testing to engage and involve the public in the research effort has helped to create a new breed of \"citizen scientist \" Geno expands the scope for citizen science harnessing the power of the crowd to discover new details of human population history \n In journalism \n Collaborative journalism \n and \n Citizen journalism \n Crowdsourcing is increasingly used in professional journalism Journalists crowdsource information from the crowd typically fact check the information and then use it in their articles as they see fit The leading daily newspaper in Sweden has successfully used crowdsourcing in investigating the home loan interest rates in the country in 2013-2014 resulting to over submissions \n The leading daily newspaper in Finland crowdsourced investigation in stock short selling in 2011-2012 and the crowdsourced information lead to a revelation of a sketchy tax evasion system in a Finnish bank The bank executive was fired and policy changes followed \n TalkingPointsMemo in the United States asked its readers to examine emails concerning the firing of federal prosecutors in The British newspaper \n the Guardian \n crowdsourced the examination of hundreds of thousands of documents in \n In linguistics \n Crowdsourcing strategies have been applied to estimate word knowledge and vocabulary size \n In ornithology \n Another early example of crowdsourcing occurred in the field of \n ornithology \n On December Frank Chapman an early officer of the \n National Audubon Society \n initiated a tradition dubbed the \n \"Christmas Day Bird Census\" \n The project called birders from across North America to count and record the number of birds in each species they witnessed on Christmas Day The project was successful and the records from different contributors were compiled into one bird census which tallied around species of birds \n This large-scale collection of data constituted an early form of citizen science the premise upon which crowdsourcing is based In the census more than individuals participated across bird count circles \n Christmas marked the National Audubon Society's 115th annual \n Christmas Bird Count \n In public policy \n Crowdsourcing public policy and the production of public services is also referred to as \n citizen sourcing \n The first conference focusing on Crowdsourcing for Politics and Policy took place at Oxford University under the auspices of the Oxford Internet Institute in \n Research has emerged since \n that focuses on the use of crowdsourcing for policy purposes \n These include the experimental investigation of the use of Virtual Labor Markets for policy assessment \n and an assessment of the potential for citizen involvement in process innovation for public administration \n Governments across the world are increasingly using crowdsourcing for knowledge discovery and civic engagement Iceland crowdsourced their constitution reform process in and Finland has crowdsourced several law reform processes to address their off-road traffic laws The Finnish government allowed citizens to go on an online forum to discuss problems and possible resolutions regarding some off-road traffic laws The crowdsourced information and resolutions would then be passed on to legislators for them to refer to when making a decision letting citizens more directly contribute to public policy \n The City of Palo Alto is crowdsourcing people's feedback for its Comprehensive City Plan update in a process which started in \n The House of Representatives in Brazil has used crowdsourcing in policy-reforms and federal agencies in the United States have used crowdsourcing for several years \n In seismology \n The \n European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre EMSC \n has developed a seismic detection system by monitoring the traffic peaks on its website and by the analysis of keywords used on Twitter \n In libraries \n Crowdsourcing is used in libraries \n for OCR corrections on digitized texts for tagging and for funding \n Modern methods \n Currently crowdsourcing has transferred mainly to the Internet which provides a particularly beneficial venue for crowdsourcing since individuals tend to be more open in web-based projects where they are not being physically judged or scrutinized and thus can feel more comfortable sharing This approach ultimately allows for well-designed artistic projects because individuals are less conscious or maybe even less aware of scrutiny towards their work In an online atmosphere more attention can be given to the specific needs of a project rather than spending as much time in communication with other individuals \n According to a definition by Henk van Ess \n \"The crowdsourced problem can be huge epic tasks like finding alien life or mapping earthquake zones or very small 'where can I skate safely?' Some examples of successful crowdsourcing themes are problems that bug people things that make people feel good about themselves projects that tap into niche knowledge of proud experts subjects that people find sympathetic or any form of injustice \" \n Crowdsourcing can either take an explicit or an implicit route Explicit crowdsourcing lets users work together to evaluate share and build different specific tasks while implicit crowdsourcing means that users solve a problem as a side effect of something else they are doing \n With explicit crowdsourcing users can evaluate particular items like books or webpages or share by posting products or items Users can also build artifacts by providing information and editing other people's work \n Implicit crowdsourcing can take two forms standalone and piggyback Standalone allows people to solve problems as a side effect of the task they are actually doing whereas piggyback takes users' information from a third-party website to gather information \n In his book \n Crowdsourcing \n Daren C Brabham puts forth a problem-based typology of crowdsourcing approaches \n pageneeded \n Knowledge discovery and management is used for information management problems where an organization mobilizes a crowd to find and assemble information It is ideal for creating collective resources \n Distributed human intelligence tasking is used for information management problems where an organization has a set of information in hand and mobilizes a crowd to process or analyze the information It is ideal for processing large data sets that computers cannot easily do \n Broadcast search is used for ideation problems where an organization mobilizes a crowd to come up with a solution to a problem that has an objective provable right answer It is ideal for scientific problem solving \n Peer-vetted creative production is used for ideation problems where an organization mobilizes a crowd to come up with a solution to a problem which has an answer that is subjective or dependent on public support It is ideal for design aesthetic or policy problems \n Crowdsourcing often allows participants to rank each other's contributions e g in answer to the question \"What is one thing we can do to make Acme a great company?\" One common method for ranking is \"like\" counting where the contribution with the most likes ranks first This method is simple and easy to understand but it privileges early contributions which have more time to accumulate likes In recent years several crowdsourcing companies have begun to use \n pairwise comparisons \n backed by ranking algorithms Ranking algorithms do not penalize late contributions They also produce results faster Ranking algorithms have proven to be at least times faster than manual stack ranking \n \"Crowdvoting How Elo Limits Disruption\" \n thevisionlab com \n May \n One drawback however is that ranking algorithms are more difficult to understand than like counting \n Examples \n Some common categories of crowdsourcing can be used effectively in the commercial world including crowdvoting crowdsolving \n crowdfunding \n microwork \n creative crowdsourcing \n crowdsource workforce management \n and \n inducement prize contests \n Although this may not be an exhaustive list the items cover the current major ways in which people use crowds to perform tasks \n Crowdvoting \n Crowdvoting occurs when a website gathers a large group's opinions and judgments on a certain topic The \n Iowa Electronic Market \n is a prediction market that gathers crowds' views on politics and tries to ensure accuracy by having participants pay money to buy and sell contracts based on political outcomes \n Some of the most famous examples have made use of social media channels Domino's Pizza Coca-Cola Heineken and Sam Adams have thus crowdsourced a new pizza bottle design beer and song respectively \n Threadless com \n selects the T-shirts it sells by having users provide designs and vote on the ones they like which are then printed and available for purchase \n The \n California Report Card \n CRC a program jointly launched in January by the \n Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society \n and Lt Governor \n Gavin Newsom \n is an example of modern-day crowd voting Participants access the CRC online and vote on six timely issues Through \n principal component analysis \n the users are then placed into an online \"caf\" in which they can present their own political opinions and grade the suggestions of other participants This system aims to effectively involve the greater public in relevant political discussions and highlight the specific topics with which Californians are most concerned \n Crowdvoting's value in the movie industry was shown when in a crowd accurately predicting the success or failure of a movie based on its trailer \n a feat that was replicated in by Google \n On \n reddit \n users collectively rate web content discussions and comments as well as questions posed to persons of interest in \" \n AMA \n \" and \n /r/AskScience \n online interviews \n Crowdsourcing creative work \n Crowdsourcing creative work \n Creative crowdsourcing \n spans sourcing creative projects such as \n graphic design \n crowdsourcing architecture \n apparel design movies \n writing illustration etc \n While crowdsourcing competitions have been used for decades in some creative fields such as architecture creative crowdsourcing has proliferated with the recent development of web-based platforms where clients can solicit a wide variety of creative work at lower cost than by traditional means \n Crowdsourcing language-related data collection \n Crowdsourcing has also been used for gathering language-related data For dictionary work as was mentioned above it was applied over a hundred years ago by the \n Oxford English Dictionary \n editors using paper and postage Much later a call for collecting examples of proverbs on a specific topic religious pluralism was printed in a journal \n Today as \"crowdsourcing\" has the inherent connotation of being web-based such language-related data gathering is being conducted on the web by crowdsourcing in accelerating ways Currently a number of dictionary compilation projects are being conducted on the web particularly for languages that are not highly academically documented such as for the \n Oromo language \n Software programs have been developed for crowdsourced dictionaries such as \n WeSay \n A slightly different form of crowdsourcing for language data has been the online creation of scientific and mathematical terminology for \n American Sign Language \n Proverb collection \n is also being done via crowdsourcing on the Web most innovatively for the \n Pashto language \n of Afghanistan and Pakistan \n Crowdsourcing has been extensively used to collect high-quality gold standard for creating automatic systems in natural language processing e g \n named entity recognition \n entity linking \n Crowdsolving \n This section \n does not \n cite \n any \n sources \n Please help \n improve this section \n by \n adding citations to reliable sources \n Unsourced material may be challenged and \n removed \n February \n Learn how and when to remove this template message \n Crowdsolving \n Crowdsolving is a collaborative yet holistic way of solving a problem using many people communities groups or resources \n Crowdsearching \n Chicago-based startup \n Crowdfind \n formerly \"crowdfynd\" uses a version of crowdsourcing best termed as crowdsearching which differs from microwork in that no payment for taking part in the search is made \n Their platform through geographic location anchoring builds a virtual search party of smartphone and Internet users to find lost items pets or persons as well as returning them \n TrackR uses a system they call \"crowd GPS\" to load Bluetooth identities to a central server to track lost or stolen items \n Crowdfunding \n Crowdfunding \n Crowdfunding is the process of funding projects by a multitude of people contributing a small amount to attain a certain monetary goal typically via the Internet \n Crowdfunding has been used for both commercial and charitable purposes \n The crowdfuding model that has been around the longest is rewards-based crowdfunding This model is where people can prepurchase products buy experiences or simply donate While this funding may in some cases go towards helping a business funders are not allowed to invest and become shareholders via rewards-based crowdfunding \n Individuals businesses and entrepreneurs can showcase their businesses and projects to the entire world by creating a profile which typically includes a short video introducing their project a list of rewards per donation and illustrations through images The goal is to create a compelling message towards which readers will be drawn Funders make monetary contribution for numerous reasons \n They connect to the greater purpose of the campaign such as being a part of an entrepreneurial community and supporting an innovative idea or product \n They connect to a physical aspect of the campaign like rewards and gains from investment \n They connect to the creative display of the campaigns presentation \n They want to see new products before the public \n The dilemma for equity crowdfunding in the US as of was how the \n Securities and Exchange Commission \n SEC is going to regulate the entire process At the time rules and regulations were being refined by the SEC which had until January to tweak the fundraising methods The regulators were overwhelmed trying to regulate Dodd Frank and all the other rules and regulations involving public companies and the way they trade Advocates of regulation claimed that crowdfunding would open up the flood gates for fraud called it the \"wild west\" of fundraising and compared it to the 1980s days of penny stock \"cold-call cowboys\" The process allows for up to $1 million to be raised without some of the regulations being involved Companies under the then-current proposal would have exemptions available and be able to raise capital from a larger pool of persons which can include lower thresholds for investor criteria whereas the old rules required that the person be an \"accredited\" investor These people are often recruited from social networks where the funds can be acquired from an equity purchase loan donation or ordering The amounts collected have become quite high with requests that are over a million dollars for software such as Trampoline Systems which used it to finance the commercialization of their new software \n Mobile crowdsourcing \n Mobile crowdsourcing involves activities that take place on smartphones or mobile platforms frequently characterized by GPS technology \n This allows for real-time data gathering and gives projects greater reach and accessibility However mobile crowdsourcing can lead to an urban bias as well as safety and privacy concerns \n Macrowork \n Macrowork \n tasks typically have these characteristics they can be done independently they take a fixed amount of time and they require special skills Macrotasks could be part of specialized projects or could be part of a large visible project where workers pitch in wherever they have the required skills The key distinguishing factors are that macrowork requires specialized skills and typically takes longer while microwork requires no specialized skills \n Microwork \n Microwork \n is a crowdsourcing platform where users do small tasks for which computers lack aptitude for low amounts of money Amazons popular \n Mechanical Turk \n has created many different projects for users to participate in where each task requires very little time and offers a very small amount in payment \n The Chinese versions of this commonly called \n Witkey \n are similar and include such sites as Taskcn com and k68 cn When choosing tasks since only certain users win users learn to submit later and pick less popular tasks to increase the likelihood of getting their work chosen \n An example of a Mechanical Turk project is when users searched satellite images for a boat to find lost researcher Jim Gray \n Based on an elaborate survey of participants in a microtask crowdsourcing platform Gadiraju \n et al \n have proposed a taxonomy of different types of microtasks that are crowdsourced \n Simple projects \n Simple projects are those that require a large amount of time and skills compared to micro and macrowork While an example of macrowork would be writing survey feedback simple projects rather include activities like writing a basic line of code or programming a database which both require a larger time commitment and skill level These projects are usually not found on sites like \n Amazon Mechanical Turk \n and are rather posted on platforms like \n Upwork \n that call for a specific expertise \n Complex projects \n Complex projects generally take the most time have higher stakes and call for people with very specific skills These are generally one-off projects that are difficult to accomplish and can include projects like designing a new product that a company hopes to patent Tasks like that would be complex because design is a meticulous process that requires a large amount of time to perfect and also people doing these projects must have specialized training in design to effectively complete the project These projects usually pay the highest yet are rarely offered \n Inducement prize contests \n Web-based idea competitions or inducement prize contests often consist of generic ideas cash prizes and an Internet-based platform to facilitate easy idea generation and discussion An example of these competitions includes an event like IBM's \"Innovation Jam\" attended by over international participants and yielding around ideas \n Another example is the \n Netflix Prize \n in The idea was to ask the crowd to come up with a recommendation algorithm more accurate than Netflix's own algorithm It had a grand prize of US$1 and it was given to the BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos team which bested Netflix's own algorithm for predicting ratings by 06% \n Another example of competition-based crowdsourcing is the \n DARPA balloon \n experiment where DARPA placed balloon markers across the United States and challenged teams to compete to be the first to report the location of all the balloons A collaboration of efforts was required to complete the challenge quickly and in addition to the competitive motivation of the contest as a whole the winning team MIT in less than nine hours established its own \"collaborapetitive\" environment to generate participation in their team \n A similar challenge was the \n Tag Challenge \n funded by the US State Department which required locating and photographing individuals in five cities in the US and Europe within hours based only on a single photograph The winning team managed to locate three suspects by mobilizing volunteers worldwide using a similar incentive scheme to the one used in the balloon challenge \n Open innovation \n platforms are a very effective way of crowdsourcing people's thoughts and ideas to do research and development The company \n InnoCentive \n is a crowdsourcing platform for corporate research and development where difficult scientific problems are posted for crowds of solvers to discover the answer and win a cash prize which can range from $10 to $100 per challenge \n InnoCentive of Waltham MA and London England provides access to millions of scientific and technical experts from around the world The company claims a success rate of 50% in providing successful solutions to previously unsolved scientific and technical problems IdeaConnection com challenges people to come up with new inventions and innovations and Ninesigma com connects clients with experts in various fields The \n X Prize Foundation \n creates and runs incentive competitions offering between $1 million and $30 million for solving challenges \n Local Motors \n is another example of crowdsourcing A community of automotive engineers designers and enthusiasts competes to build off-road rally trucks \n Implicit crowdsourcing \n Implicit crowdsourcing is less obvious because users do not necessarily know they are contributing yet can still be very effective in completing certain tasks Rather than users actively participating in solving a problem or providing information implicit crowdsourcing involves users doing another task entirely where a third party gains information for another topic based on the user's actions \n A good example of implicit crowdsourcing is the \n ESP game \n where users guess what images are and then these labels are used to tag Google images Another popular use of implicit crowdsourcing is through \n reCAPTCHA \n which asks people to solve \n CAPTCHAs \n to prove they are human and then provides CAPTCHAs from old books that cannot be deciphered by computers to digitize them for the web Like many tasks solved using the Mechanical Turk CAPTCHAs are simple for humans but often very difficult for computers \n Piggyback crowdsourcing can be seen most frequently by websites such as Google that data-mine a user's search history and websites to discover keywords for ads spelling corrections and finding synonyms In this way users are unintentionally helping to modify existing systems such as Google's \n AdWords \n Health-care crowdsourcing \n Research has emerged that outlines the use of crowdsourcing techniques in the public health domain The collective intelligence outcomes from crowdsourcing are being generated in three broad categories of public health care health promotion health research \n and health maintenance \n Crowdsourcing also enables researchers to move from small homogeneous groups of participants to large heterogenous groups \n beyond convenience samples such as students or higher educated people \n Crowdsourcing in agriculture \n Crowdsource research also reaches to the field of agriculture This is mainly to give the farmers and experts a kind of help in identification of different types of weeds \n from the fields and also to give them the best way to remove the weeds from fields \n Crowdsourcing in cheating in bridge \n Main articles \n Cheating in bridge \n and \n Boye Brogeland \n Boye Brogeland \n initiated a crowdsourcing investigation of cheating by top-level \n bridge \n players that showed several players were guilty which led to their suspension \n Crowdsourcers \n A number of motivations exist for businesses to use crowdsourcing to accomplish their tasks find solutions for problems or to gather information These include the ability to offload peak demand access cheap labor and information generate better results access a wider array of talent than might be present in one organization and undertake problems that would have been too difficult to solve internally \n Crowdsourcing allows businesses to submit problems on which contributors can work on topics such as science manufacturing biotech and medicine with monetary rewards for successful solutions Although crowdsourcing complicated tasks can be difficult simple work tasks can be crowdsourced cheaply and effectively \n Crowdsourcing also has the potential to be a problem-solving mechanism for government and nonprofit use \n Urban and transit planning are prime areas for crowdsourcing One project to test crowdsourcing's public participation process for transit planning in Salt Lake City was carried out from to funded by a U S Federal Transit Administration grant \n Another notable application of crowdsourcing to government \n problem solving \n is the Peer to Patent Community Patent Review project for the U S Patent and Trademark Office \n Researchers have used crowdsourcing systems like the Mechanical Turk to aid their research projects by crowdsourcing some aspects of the research process such as data collection parsing and evaluation Notable examples include using the crowd to create speech and language databases \n and using the crowd to conduct user studies \n Crowdsourcing systems provide these researchers with the ability to gather large amount of data Additionally using crowdsourcing researchers can collect data from populations and demographics they may not have had access to locally but that improve the validity and value of their work \n Artists have also used crowdsourcing systems In his project called the Sheep Market \n Aaron Koblin \n used Mechanical Turk to collect drawings of sheep from contributors around the world \n Sam Brown artist \n leverages the crowd by asking visitors of his website \n explodingdog \n to send him sentences that he uses as inspirations for paintings \n Art curator Andrea Grover argues that individuals tend to be more open in crowdsourced projects because they are not being physically judged or scrutinized \n As with other crowdsourcers artists use crowdsourcing systems to generate and collect data The crowd also can be used to provide inspiration and to collect financial support for an artist's work \n Additionally crowdsourcing from million drivers is being used by \n INRIX \n to collect users' driving times to provide better GPS routing and real-time traffic updates \n Demographics \n The crowd is an umbrella term for the people who contribute to crowdsourcing efforts Though it is sometimes difficult to gather data about the \n demographics \n of the crowd a study by Ross \n et al \n surveyed the demographics of a sample of the more than registered crowdworkers using Amazon Mechanical Turk to complete tasks for pay A previous study in by \n Ipeirotis \n found that users at that time were primarily American young female and well-educated with 40% earning more than $40 per year In November Ross found a very different Mechanical Turk population 36% of which was Indian Two-thirds of Indian workers were male and 66% had at least a bachelor's degree Two-thirds had annual incomes less than $10 with 27% sometimes or always depending on income from Mechanical Turk to make ends meet \n The average US user of Mechanical Turk earned $2 per hour for tasks in versus $1 for the average Indian worker \n citation needed \n While the majority of users worked less than five hours per week 18% worked hours per week or more This is less than \n minimum wage \n in the United States but not in India which Ross suggests raises ethical questions for researchers who use crowdsourcing \n The demographics of Microworkers com differ from Mechanical Turk in that the US and India together account for only 25% of workers countries are represented among users with Indonesia 18% and Bangladesh 17% contributing the largest share However 28% of employers are from the US \n Another study of the demographics of the crowd at iStockphoto found a crowd that was largely white middle- to upper-class higher educated worked in a so-called \"white-collar job\" and had a high-speed Internet connection at home \n In a crowd-sourcing diary study of days in Europe the participants were predominantly higher educated women \n Studies have also found that crowds are not simply collections of amateurs or hobbyists Rather crowds are often professionally trained in a discipline relevant to a given crowdsourcing task and sometimes hold advanced degrees and many years of experience in the profession \n Claiming that crowds are amateurs rather than professionals is both factually untrue and may lead to marginalization of crowd labor rights \n G D Saxton \n et al \n studied the role of community users among other elements during his content analysis of crowdsourcing organizations Saxton \n et al \n developed a taxonomy of nine crowdsourcing models intermediary model citizen media production collaborative software development digital goods sales product design peer-to-peer social financing consumer report model knowledge base building model and collaborative science project model in which to categorize the roles of community users such as researcher engineer programmer journalist graphic designer etc and the products and services developed \n Motivations \n Further information \n Online participation Motivations \n Contributors \n Many scholars of crowdsourcing suggest that both \n intrinsic \n and \n extrinsic \n motivations cause people to contribute to crowdsourced tasks and these factors influence different types of contributors \n For example students and people employed full-time rate human capital advancement as less important than part-time workers do while women rate social contact as more important than men do \n Intrinsic motivations are broken down into two categories enjoyment-based and community-based motivations Enjoyment-based motivations refer to motivations related to the fun and enjoyment that contributors experience through their participation These motivations include skill variety task identity task autonomy direct feedback from the job and pastime Community-based motivations refer to motivations related to community participation and include community identification and social contact In crowdsourced journalism the motivation factors are intrinsic the crowd is driven by a possibility to make social impact contribute to social change and help their peers \n Extrinsic motivations are broken down into three categories immediate payoffs delayed payoffs and social motivations Immediate payoffs through monetary payment are the immediately received compensations given to those who complete tasks Delayed payoffs are benefits that can be used to generate future advantages such as training skills and being noticed by potential employers Social motivations are the rewards of behaving pro-socially \n such as the altruistic motivations of \n online volunteers \n Chandler and Kapelner found that US users of the Amazon Mechanical Turk were more likely to complete a task when told they were going to help researchers identify tumor cells than when they were not told the purpose of their task However of those who completed the task quality of output did not depend on the framing of the task \n Motivation factors in crowdsourcing are often a mix of intrinsic and extrinsic factors \n In a crowdsourced law-making project the crowd was motivated by a mix of intrinsic and extrinsic factors Intrinsic motivations included fulfilling civic duty affecting the law for sociotropic reasons to deliberate with and learn from peers Extrinsic motivations included changing the law for financial gain or other benefits Participation in crowdsourced policy-making was an act of grassroots advocacy whether to pursue ones own interest or more altruistic goals such as protecting nature \n Another form of social motivation is prestige or status The \n International Children's Digital Library \n recruits volunteers to translate and review books Because all translators receive public acknowledgment for their contributions Kaufman and Schulz cite this as a reputation-based strategy to motivate individuals who want to be associated with institutions that have prestige The Mechanical Turk uses reputation as a motivator in a different sense as a form of quality control Crowdworkers who frequently complete tasks in ways judged to be inadequate can be denied access to future tasks providing motivation to produce high-quality work \n Requesters \n Using crowdsourcing through means such as Amazon Mechanical Turk can help provide researchers and requesters with an already established infrastructure for their projects allowing them to easily use a crowd and access participants from a diverse culture background Using crowdsourcing can also help complete the work for projects that would normally have geographical and population size limitations \n Participation in crowdsourcing \n Despite the potential global reach of IT applications online recent research illustrates that differences in location \n which? \n affect participation outcomes in IT-mediated crowds \n Limitations and controversies \n At least five major topics cover the limitations and controversies about crowdsourcing \n Impact of crowdsourcing on product quality \n Entrepreneurs contribute less capital themselves \n Increased number of funded ideas \n The value and impact of the work received from the crowd \n The ethical implications of low wages paid to crowdworkers \n Impact of crowdsourcing on product quality \n Crowdsourcing allows anyone to participate allowing for many unqualified participants and resulting in large quantities of unusable contributions Companies or additional crowdworkers then have to sort through all of these low-quality contributions The task of sorting through crowdworkers contributions along with the necessary job of managing the crowd requires companies to hire actual employees thereby increasing management overhead \n For example susceptibility to faulty results is caused by targeted malicious work efforts Since crowdworkers completing microtasks are paid per task often a financial incentive causes workers to complete tasks quickly rather than well Verifying responses is time-consuming so requesters often depend on having multiple workers complete the same task to correct errors However having each task completed multiple times increases time and monetary costs \n Crowdsourcing quality is also impacted by task design Lukyanenko \n et al \n argue that the prevailing practice of modeling crowdsourcing data collection tasks in terms of fixed classes options unnecessarily restricts quality Results demonstrate that information accuracy depends on the classes used to model domains with participants providing more accurate information when classifying phenomena at a more general level which is typically less useful to sponsor organizations hence less common Further greater overall accuracy is expected when participants could provide free-form data compared to tasks in which they select from constrained choices \n Just as limiting oftentimes the scenario is that just not enough skills or expertise exist in the crowd to successfully accomplish the desired task While this scenario does not affect \"simple\" tasks such as image labeling it is particularly problematic for more complex tasks such as engineering design or product validation In these cases it may be difficult or even impossible to find the qualified people in the crowd as their voices may be drowned out by consistent but incorrect crowd members \n However if the difficulty of the task is even \"intermediate\" in its difficultly estimating crowdworkers' skills and intentions and leveraging them for inferring true responses works well \n albeit with an additional computation cost \n Crowdworkers are a nonrandom sample of the population Many researchers use crowdsourcing to quickly and cheaply conduct studies with larger sample sizes than would be otherwise achievable However due to limited access to the Internet participation in low developed countries is relatively low Participation in highly developed countries is similarly low largely because the low amount of pay is not a strong motivation for most users in these countries These factors lead to a bias in the population pool towards users in medium developed countries as deemed by the \n human development index \n The likelihood that a crowdsourced project will fail due to lack of monetary motivation or too few participants increases over the course of the project Crowdsourcing markets are not a first-in first-out queue Tasks that are not completed quickly may be forgotten buried by filters and search procedures so that workers do not see them This results in a long-tail power law distribution of completion times \n Additionally low-paying research studies online have higher rates of attrition with participants not completing the study once started \n Even when tasks are completed crowdsourcing does not always produce quality results When \n Facebook \n began its localization program in it encountered some criticism for the low quality of its crowdsourced translations \n One of the problems of crowdsourcing products is the lack of interaction between the crowd and the client Usually little information is known about the final desired product and often very limited interaction with the final client occurs This can decrease the quality of product because client interaction is a vital part of the design process \n An additional cause of the decrease in product quality that can result from crowdsourcing is the lack of collaboration tools In a typical workplace coworkers are organized in such a way that they can work together and build upon each others knowledge and ideas Furthermore the company often provides employees with the necessary information procedures and tools to fulfill their responsibilities However in crowdsourcing crowdworkers are left to depend on their own knowledge and means to complete tasks \n A crowdsourced project is usually expected to be unbiased by incorporating a large population of participants with a diverse background However most of the crowdsourcing works are done by people who are paid or directly benefit from the outcome e g most of \n open source \n projects working on \n Linux \n In many other cases the end product is the outcome of a single person's endeavour who creates the majority of the product while the crowd only participates in minor details \n Entrepreneurs contribute less capital themselves \n To make an idea turn into a reality the first component needed is capital Depending on the scope and complexity of the crowdsourced project the amount of necessary capital can range from a few thousand dollars to hundreds of thousands if not more The capital-raising process can take from days to months depending on different variables including the entrepreneurs network and the amount of initial self-generated capital \n The crowdsourcing process allows entrepreneurs to access to a wide range of investors who can take different stakes in the project \n In effect crowdsourcing simplifies the capital-raising process and allows entrepreneurs to spend more time on the project itself and reaching milestones rather than dedicating time to get it started Overall the simplified access to capital can save time to start projects and potentially increase efficiency of projects \n Opponents of this issue argue easier access to capital through a large number of smaller investors can hurt the project and its creators With a simplified capital-raising process involving more investors with smaller stakes investors are more risk-seeking because they can take on an investment size with which they are comfortable \n This leads to entrepreneurs losing possible experience convincing investors who are wary of potential risks in investing because they do not depend on one single investor for the survival of their project Instead of being forced to assess risks and convince large institutional investors why their project can be successful wary investors can be replaced by others who are willing to take on the risk \n There are translation companies and several users of translations who pretend to use crowdsourcing as a means for drastically cutting costs instead of hiring \n professional translators \n This situation has been systematically denounced by \n IAPTI \n and other translator organizations \n Increased number of funded ideas \n The raw number of ideas that get funded and the quality of the ideas is a large controversy over the issue of crowdsourcing \n Proponents argue that crowdsourcing is beneficial because it allows niche ideas that would not survive venture capitalist or angel funding many times the primary investors in startups to be started Many ideas are killed in their infancy due to insufficient support and lack of capital but crowdsourcing allows these ideas to be started if an entrepreneur can find a community to take interest in the project \n Crowdsourcing allows those who would benefit from the project to fund and become a part of it which is one way for small niche ideas get started \n However when the raw number of projects grows the number of possible failures can also increase Crowdsourcing assists niche and high-risk projects to start because of a perceived need from a select few who seek the product With high risk and small target markets the pool of crowdsourced projects faces a greater possible loss of capital lower return and lower levels of success \n Concerns \n Because crowdworkers are considered independent contractors rather than employees they are not guaranteed \n minimum wage \n In practice workers using the Amazon Mechanical Turk generally earn less than the minimum wage with US users earning an average of $2 per hour for tasks in and users in India earning an average of $1 per hour which is below minimum wage in the United States but not in India \n Some researchers who have considered using Mechanical Turk to get participants for research studies have argued that the wage conditions might be unethical \n However according to other research workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk do not feel that they are exploited and are ready to participate in crowdsourcing activities in the future \n When Facebook began its localization program in it received criticism for using free labor in crowdsourcing the translation of site guidelines \n Typically no written contracts nondisclosure agreements or employee agreements are made with crowdworkers For users of the Amazon Mechanical Turk this means that requestors decide whether users' work is acceptable and reserve the right to withhold pay if it does not meet their standards \n Critics say that crowdsourcing arrangements exploit individuals in the crowd and a call has been made for crowds to organize for their labor rights \n Collaboration between crowd members can also be difficult or even discouraged especially in the context of competitive crowd sourcing Crowdsourcing site InnoCentive allows organizations to solicit solutions to scientific and technological problems only 6% of respondents report working in a team on their submission \n Amazon Mechanical Turk workers collaborated with academics to create a platform WeAreDynamo org that allows them to organize and create campaigns to better their work situation \n Irresponsible crowdsourcing \n The popular forum website \n reddit \n came under the spotlight during the first few days after the events of the \n Boston Marathon bombing \n as it showed how powerful social media and crowdsourcing could be Reddit was able to help many victims of the bombing as they sent relief and some even opened up their homes all being communicated very efficiently on their site However Reddit soon came under fire after they started to crowdsource information on the possible perpetrators of the bombing While the FBI received thousands of photos from average citizens the website also started to focus on crowdsourcing their own investigation with the information that they were crowdsourcing Eventually Reddit members claimed to have found bombers but all were innocent including a college student who had committed suicide a few days before the bombing The problem was exacerbated when the media also started to rely on Reddit as their source for information \n citation needed \n allowing the misinformation to spread almost nationwide The FBI has since warned the media to be more careful of where they are getting their information but Reddits investigation and its false accusations opened up questions about what should be crowdsourced and the unintended consequences of irresponsible crowdsourcing \n Citizen science \n

term \n Relationship with the free software movement \n Board members \n As a campaign of sorts \"open source\" was launched in by \n Jon \"maddog\" Hall \n Larry Augustin \n Eric S Raymond \n Bruce Perens \n and others \n The group adopted the \n Open Source Definition \n for open-source software based on the \n Debian Free Software Guidelines \n They also established the Open Source Initiative OSI as a steward organization for the movement However they were unsuccessful in their attempt to secure a \n trademark \n for 'open source' to control the use of the term \n In in an apparent effort to reform governance of the organization the OSI Board invited individuals to join a \"Charter Members\" group by July of the original invitees had accepted the invitations The full membership of the

operation as a California corporation apparently in response to a complaint concerning tax paperwork from earlier years \n clarification needed \n Its current status is \"Active\" \n In under the leadership of OSI director and then-president \n Simon Phipps \n the OSI began transitioning towards a membership-based governance structure The OSI initiated an Affiliate Membership program for

confrontational attitude that had been associated with 'free software'\" and instead promote open source ideas on \"pragmatic business-case grounds \" \n As early as OSI co-founder Perens objected to the \"schism\" that was developing between supporters of Stallman's \n Free Software Foundation \n FSF and the OSI because of their disparate approaches Perens had hoped the OSI would merely serve as an \"introduction\" to FSF principles for \"non-hackers \" \n Stallman has sharply criticized the OSI for its pragmatic focus and for ignoring what he considers the central \"ethical imperative\" and emphasis on \"freedom\" underlying \n free software \n as he defines it \n Nevertheless Stallman has described his free software movement and the Open Source Initiative as separate camps within the

is an emerging paradigm that advocates new procedures in imagination and formation of virtual and real spaces within a universal \n infrastructure \n Drawing from references as diverse as \n open-source \n culture \n modular design \n avant-garde \n architectural theory \n science fiction \n language theory and \n neuro-surgery \n it adopts an inclusive approach as per \n spatial design \n towards a collaborative use of design and design tools by professionals and ordinary citizen users The umbrella term \n citizen-centered design \n harnesses the notion of \n open-source architecture \n which in itself involves the non-building architecture of computer networks and goes beyond it to the movement that encompass the building design professions as a whole \n Citizen-centered design was spearheaded in by academic research in leading universities such as the University of Texas SUPA \n and professional practice organizations such as the Earthnomad Foundation \n and ARK Tectonics \n to position the citizen-centered design movement at the intersection of design and public policy In the decades that followed the movement grew to encompass various efforts around the globe from organizations and collaborations to community design centers sponsored by academic institutions The principles of the citizen-centered design movement and by extension open-source architecture were built on the body of knowledge accumulated since the 1960s on citizen participation research and practices \n Around the turn of the century citizen engagement research and practices were reformulated through the lens of more effective approaches and paradigms in the social and applied sciences through the seminal work of Dr Schaban-Maurer architect urban planner and author of the deliberative design and phronetic engagement resource \"Rise of the Citizen Practitioner\" \n Dr Schaban-Maurer laid out the principles and precepts of his 'Life-Experience Narrative Exchange' methodology in the Mindful Policy Engagement field which he founded in with the ground-breaking work 'The Roles of the Citizen Practitioner in Citizen Engagement for Architecture Urban Design and Urban Planning Policy A Phronesis-Based Approach\" \n The work provides rigorous theoretical basis for a body of best case studies and best practices of citizen-centered architecture urban design and urban planning as well as urban and public policy According to Dr Schaban-Maurer the LENE methodology leads to meaningful and effective design practices by integrating their processes with the principles of Phronetic Engagement and Mindful Policy into a new field of inquiry 'Mindful Policy Engagement ' Schaban-Maurer \n Since then open-source architecture practitioners and academics have increased the reach and influence of the citizen-centered design movement to other fields through inter-disciplinary collaborations publications conferences and international exhibitions In the last decade open-source architecture the mindful policy engagement field and the citizen-centered design movement have spawned smaller derivative subsets of various names most prominent of which is 'social impact design' 'public interest design' and the 'open architecture network' whose adherents combine design practice with social service These early efforts decades ago are being propelled forward by new sensibilities through the continued commitment of architects urban designers planners policy-makers and other stakeholders to engage and harness the knowledge of ordinary citizens in the design development and implementation of urban policies for projects that impact the very communities where we all live and work \n Cooking \n is often hailed as an early form of open source \n

\n and \n crowd-funding \n strategies like \n Sponsume \n and \n Kickstarter \n offer new modes of project initiation and development destabilising the traditionally feudal hierarchy of client/architect/occupant Financing of private projects increasingly moves to the public domain offering mass rather than singular ownership whereas funding of public projects can be derived from more flexible responsive frameworks than simple levies or taxation Open-source architecture should have particular appeal for builders entirely outside the mainstream economy such as squatters refugees and the military \n Engagement \n Open-source architecture relies upon amateurs as much as experienced professionals the \"genius of the mass\" as much as that of the individual \n eroding the binary distinction between author and audience Like social software it recognises the core role of multiple users at every stage of the project whether as clients or communities designers or occupants at its best it harnesses powerful network effects to scale systems effectively It is typically democratic enshrining principles of open access and participation though political variations range from stealth authoritarianism to communitarian consensualism \n Traditional developments require engagement programmes in which the 'community' is 'consulted' with respect to incoming developments often with blunt tools such as focus groups which often result in lack of representation and input or at worst can result in \n NIMBYism \n With crowd-funded models forms of engagement are built into the process enabling a kind of emergent urbanism in which use of space is optimised on terms set by its users This reclamation of people's power can be seen as a soft spatial version of \n Hacktivism \n Open-source architecture is likely to suffer some of the organizational drawbacks of \n open-source software \n such as forking of projects abandoned projects the emergence of cliques and incompatibility with the installed base of buildings Organized campaigns of \n fear uncertainty and doubt \n are probable \n Standards \n An important aspect of open-source architecture is the emergence of \n open standards \n of collaboration The establishment of common open modular standards such as the grid proposed by the \n OpenStructures \n project \n addresses the problem of hardware compatibility and the interface between components allowing collaborative efforts across networks in which everyone designs for everyone The establishment of universal standards also encourages the growth of networks of non-monetary exchange knowledge parts components ideas and remote collaboration \n Design \n Mass customisation replaces standardisation as algorithms enable the generation of related but differentiated species of design objects \n Parametric design \n tools like \n Grasshopper \n GenerativeComponents \n Revit \n and \n Digital Project \n enable new user groups to interact with navigate and modify the virtual designs and to test and experience arrays of options at unprecedented low cost recognizing laypeople as design decision making agents rather than just consumers Open-source codes and scripts enable design communities to share and compare information and to collectively optimise production through modular components accelerating the historical accumulation of shared knowledge \n BIM \n Building Information Modelling and related collaboration tools and practices enable cross-disciplinary co-location of design information and integration of a range of platforms and timescales \n Rapid prototyping \n and other \n 3D printing \n technologies enable instant production of physical artefacts both representational and functional even at an architectural scale to an ever-wider audience \n There are severe criticisms of the use of currently popular design software however because of the impossibility of future residents and users to access them P2P Urbanism promotes low-tech design solutions that collect traditionally-derived design knowledge and makes it available on an open-source web platform This focus instead promotes traditional local materials and building techniques in \n vernacular architecture \n and is entirely distinct from that of the virtual design groups focusing upon the extremely expensive parametric design The proponents of P2P Urbanism also philosophically oppose what they see as \"fashionable\" design approaches because of a link to unsustainable products strong commercial interests and total control by only a few participantswhich is the opposite of opening up design to the whole population In their view the point of open-source design should be to facilitate users designing and building their own dwellings not to continue promoting a design elite that includes current \n starchitects \n Construction \n The burgeoning \n open-source hardware \n movement enables sharing of and collaboration on the hardware involved in designing kinetic or smart environments that tightly integrate software hardware and mechanisms Through these various tools informed by sensor data design becomes an ongoing evolutionary process as opposed to the one-off disjointed fire-and-forget method of traditional design This is an acknowledgement of the fact that design has always been an unending process as well as a collaboration between users and designers Operating systems for the design construction and occupancy phases become possible created as open platforms stimulating a rich ecosystem of 'apps' Various practices jostle to become the \n Linux \n of architectural software engaging in 'platform plays' at different scales rather than delivery of plans and sections Embedded sensing and computing increasingly mesh all materials within the larger \" \n Internet of things \n \" evolving ever closer towards \n Bruce Sterling \n 's vision of a world of \n Spimes \n Materials communicate their position and state during fabrication and construction aiding positioning fixing and verification and continue to communicate with distributed databases for the extent of their lifetime \n Occupancy

spaces constantly communicating their various properties states and attributes often through decentralised and devolved systems Crucial system feedback is supplied by a wide range of users and occupants often either by miniature electronic devices or mobile phones \n crowdsourcing \n like crowd-funding large volumes of small data feeds to provide accurate and expansive real-time information Personalisation replaces standardisation as spaces 'intelligently' recognise and respond to individual occupants Representations of spaces become as vital after construction as they are before \n real-time monitoring \n feedback and \n ambient display \n become integral elements to the ongoing life of spaces and objects Maintenance and operations become extended inseparable phases of the

Benkler significantly expands on his definition of commons-based peer production According to Benkler what distinguishes commons-based production is that it doesn't rely upon or propagate proprietary knowledge \"The inputs and outputs of the process are shared freely or conditionally in an institutional form that leaves them equally available for all to use as they choose at their individual discretion \" To ensure that the knowledge generated is available for free use commons-based projects are often shared under an \n open license \n Not all commons-based production necessarily qualifies as commons-based peer production According to Benkler peer production is defined not only by the openness of its outputs but also by a decentralized participant-driven working method of working \n Peer production enterprises have two primary advantages over traditional hierarchical approaches to production \n Information gain \n Peer production allows individuals to self-assign tasks that suit their own skills expertise and interests Contributors can generate \n dynamic content \n that reflects the individual skills and the \"variability of human creativity \" \n Great variability of human and \n information resources \n leads to substantial increasing returns to scale to the number of people and resources and projects that may be accomplished without need for a contract or other factor permitting the proper use of the resource for a project \n In \n Wikinomics \n Don Tapscott \n and \n Anthony D Williams \n suggest an \n incentive \n mechanism behind common-based peer production \"People participate in peer production communities \" they write \"for a wide range of intrinsic and self-interested reasons basically people who participate in peer production communities love it They feel passionate about their particular area of expertise and revel in creating something new or better \" \n Aaron Krowne \n offers another definition \n commons-based peer production refers to any coordinated chiefly internet-based effort whereby volunteers contribute project components and there exists some process to combine them to produce a unified intellectual work CBPP covers many different types of intellectual output from software to libraries of quantitative data to \n human-readable \n documents manuals books encyclopedias reviews blogs periodicals and more \n Principles \n First the potential goals of peer production must be \n modular \n In other words objectives must be divisible into components or modules each of which can be independently produced That allows participants to work asynchronously without having to wait for each other's contributions or coordinate with each other in person \n Second the \n granularity \n of the modules is essential Granularity refers to the degree to which objects are broken down into smaller pieces module size \n Different levels of granularity will allow people with different levels of motivation to work together by contributing small or large grained modules consistent with their level of interest in the project and their motivation \n Third a successful peer-production enterprise must have low-cost \n integration \n the mechanism by which the modules are integrated into a whole end product Thus integration must include both quality controls over the modules and a mechanism for integrating the contributions into the finished product at relatively low cost \n Examples \n Additional examples of commons-based peer production communities by the P2Pvalue project \n One day living with commons-based peer production communities by the P2Pvalue project \n Examples of projects using commons-based peer production include \n Linux \n a computer operating system kernel \n GNU \n a computer operating system generally used in conjunction with the kernel Linux \n Slashdot \n a news and announcements website \n Wikipedia \n an online encyclopedia \n Distributed Proofreaders \n which proof reads public domain etexts for publication on \n Project Gutenberg \n SETI@home \n a project which searches for extra terrestrial life \n Kuro5hin \n a discussion site for technology and

Manufacturing \n GROWL \n a \n degrowth \n education network producing open materials and curricula \n Community Garden \n where people work together to grow things and then share the fruits of their labor \n Outgrowths \n Several outgrowths have been \n Customization/Specialization With \n free and open source software \n small groups have the capability to customize a large project according to specific needs With the rise of low-cost \n 3-D printing \n and other digital manufacturing techniques this is now also becoming true of \n open source hardware \n Longevity Once code is released under a \n copyleft \n free software license \n it is almost impossible to remove it from the public domain \n Cross-fertilization Experts in a field can work on more than one project with no legal hassles \n Technology Revisions A core technology gives rise to new implementations of existing projects \n Technology Clustering Groups of products tend to cluster around a core set of technology and integrate with one another \n Related concepts \n Open-source model \n Interrelated concepts to Commons-based peer production are the processes of peer governance and peer property To begin with peer governance is a new mode of governance and \n bottom-up \n mode of \n participative decision-making \n that is being experimented in peer projects such as \n Wikipedia \n and \n FLOSS \n thus peer governance is the way that peer production the process in which common value is produced is managed \n Peer Property indicates the innovative nature of legal forms such as the General Public License the Creative Commons etc Whereas traditional forms of property are exclusionary \"if it is mine it is not yours\" peer property forms are inclusionary It is from all of us i e also for you provided you respect the basic rules laid out in the license such as the openness of the source code for example \n The ease of entering and leaving an organization is a feature of \n adhocracies \n The principle of commons-based peer production is similar to \n collective invention \n a model of \n open innovation \n in economics coined by Robert Allen \n Also related \n Open-source economics \n and \n Commercial use of copyleft works \n Criticism \n Some \n believe that the commons-based peer production CBPP vision while powerful and groundbreaking needs to be strengthened at its root because of some allegedly wrong assumptions concerning free and open source software FOSS \n The CBPP literature regularly and explicitly quotes FOSS products as examples of artifacts emerging by virtue of mere cooperation with no need for supervising leadership without market signals or managerial commands in Benklers words \n It can be argued however that in the development of any less than trivial piece of software irrespective of whether it be FOSS or proprietary a subset of the many participants always play -explicitly and deliberately- the role of leading system and subsystem designers determining architecture and functionality while most of the people work underneath them in a logical functional sense \n weaselwords \n Anti-rival good \n Carr-Benkler wager \n Co-creation \n Cognitive Surplus

may also have various properties of how it was designed e g open process There is no single definition and interpretations vary with usage \n The terms \n open \n and \n standard \n have a wide range of meanings associated with their usage There are a number of definitions of open standards which emphasize different aspects of openness including the openness of the resulting specification the openness of the drafting process and the ownership of rights in the standard The term \"standard\" is sometimes restricted to technologies approved by formalized committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate on a consensus basis \n The definitions of the term \n open standard \n used by academics the European Union and some of its member governments or parliaments such as Denmark France and Spain preclude open standards requiring fees for use as do the New Zealand South African and the Venezuelan governments On the standard organisation side the \n World Wide Web Consortium \n W3C ensures that its specifications can be implemented on a \n royalty-free \n basis \n Many definitions of the term \n standard \n permit patent holders to impose \"reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing\" royalty fees and other licensing terms on implementers or users of the standard For example the rules for standards published by the major internationally recognized standards bodies such as the \n Internet Engineering Task Force \n IETF \n International Organization for Standardization \n ISO \n International Electrotechnical Commission \n IEC and \n ITU-T \n permit their standards to contain specifications whose implementation will require payment of patent licensing fees Among these organizations only the IETF and ITU-T explicitly refer to their standards as \"open standards\" while the others refer only to producing \"standards\" The IETF and ITU-T use definitions of \"open standard\" that allow \n \"reasonable and non-discriminatory\" patent licensing \n fee requirements \n There are those in the open-source software community who hold that an \"open standard\" is only open if it can be freely adopted implemented and extended \n While open standards or architectures are considered non-proprietary in the sense that the standard is either unowned or owned by a collective body it can still be publicly shared and not tightly guarded \n The typical example of open source that has become a standard is the personal computer originated by IBM and now referred to as Wintel the combination of the Microsoft operating system and Intel microprocessor There are three others that are most widely accepted as open which include the GSM phones adopted as a government standard Open Group which promotes UNIX and the like and the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF which created the first standards of SMTP and TCP/IP Buyers tend to prefer open standards which they believe offer them cheaper products and more choice for access due to network effects and increased competition between vendors \n Open standards which specify formats are sometimes referred to as \n open formats \n Many specifications that are sometimes referred to as standards are proprietary and only available under restrictive contract terms if they can be obtained at all from the organization that owns the copyright on the specification As such these specifications are not considered to be fully \n open \n Joel West has argued that \"open\" standards are not black and white but have many different levels of \"openness\" Ultimately a standard needs \n according to whom? \n to be open enough that it will become adopted and accepted in the market but still closed enough that firms can get a return on their investment in developing the technology around the standard A more open standard tends to occur when the knowledge of the technology becomes dispersed enough that competition is increased and others are able to start copying the technology as they implement it This occurred with the Wintel architecture as others were able to start imitating the software Less open standards exist when a particular firm has much power not ownership over the standard which can occur when a firms platform wins in standard setting or the market makes one platform most popular \n Specific definitions of an open standard \n

Society ISOC World Wide Web Consortium W3C Internet Engineering Task Force IETF and Internet Architecture Board IAB \n jointly affirmed \n a set of principles which have contributed to the exponential growth of the Internet and related technologies The \n OpenStand Principles \n define open standards and establish the building blocks for innovation Standards developed using the OpenStand principles are developed through an open participatory process support interoperability foster global competition are voluntarily adopted on a global level and serve as building blocks for products and services targeted to meet the needs of markets and consumers This drives innovation which in turn contributes to the creation of new markets and the growth and expansion of existing markets \n There are five key OpenStand Principles as outlined below \n Cooperation \n Respectful cooperation between standards organizations whereby each respects the autonomy integrity processes and intellectual property rules of the others \n Adherence to Principles \n Adherence to the five fundamental principles of standards development \n Due process \n Decisions are made with equity and fairness among participants No one party dominates or guides standards development Standards processes are transparent and opportunities exist to appeal decisions Processes for periodic standards review and updating are well defined \n Broad consensus \n Processes allow for all views to be considered and addressed such that agreement can be found across a range of interests \n Transparency \n Standards organizations provide advance public notice of proposed standards development activities the scope of work to be undertaken and conditions for participation Easily accessible records of decisions and the materials used in reaching those decisions are provided Public comment periods are provided before final standards approval and adoption \n Balance \n Standards activities are not exclusively dominated by any particular person company or interest group \n Openness \n Standards processes are open to all interested and informed parties \n Collective Empowerment \n Commitment by affirming standards organizations and their participants to collective empowerment by striving for standards that \n are chosen and defined based on technical merit as judged by the contributed expertise of each participant \n provide global interoperability scalability stability and resiliency \n enable global competition \n serve as building blocks for further innovation and \n contribute to the creation of global communities benefiting humanity \n Availability \n Standards specifications are made accessible to all for implementation and deployment Affirming standards organizations have defined procedures to develop specifications that can be implemented under fair terms Given market diversity fair terms may vary from royalty-free to fair reasonable and non-discriminatory terms FRAND \n Voluntary Adoption \n Standards are voluntarily adopted and success is determined by the market \n ITU-T definition \n The \n ITU-T \n is a \n standards development organization \n SDO that is one of the three sectors of the \n International Telecommunications Union \n a specialized agency of the \n United Nations \n The ITU-T has a Telecommunication Standardization Bureau director's \n Ad Hoc \n group on IPR that produced the following definition in March which the ITU-T as a whole has endorsed for its purposes since November \n The \n ITU-T \n has a long history of open standards development However recently some different external sources have attempted to define the term \"Open Standard\" in a variety of different ways In order to avoid confusion the ITU-T uses for its purpose the term \"Open Standards\" per the following definition \n \"Open Standards\" are standards made available to the general public and are developed or approved and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process \"Open Standards\" facilitate \n interoperability \n and data exchange among different products or services and are intended for widespread adoption \n Other elements of \"Open Standards\" include but are not limited to \n Collaborative process voluntary and market driven development or approval following a transparent consensus driven process that is reasonably open to all interested parties \n Reasonably balanced ensures that the process is not dominated by any one interest group \n Due process - includes consideration of and response to comments by interested parties \n Intellectual property rights IPRs IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide non-discriminatory basis either for free and under other reasonable terms and conditions or on reasonable terms and conditions which may include monetary compensation Negotiations are left to the parties concerned and are performed outside the \n SDO \n Quality and level of detail sufficient to permit the development of a variety of competing implementations of interoperable products or services Standardized interfaces are not hidden or controlled other than by the SDO promulgating the standard \n Publicly available easily available for implementation and use at a reasonable price Publication of the text of a standard by others is permitted only with the prior approval of the SDO \n On-going support maintained and supported over a long period of time \n The \n ITU-T \n ITU-R \n ISO \n and \n IEC \n have harmonized on a common patent policy \n under the banner of the \n WSC \n However the ITU-T definition should not necessarily be considered also applicable in ITU-R ISO and IEC contexts since the Common Patent Policy \n does not make any reference to \"open standards\" but rather only to \"standards \" \n IETF definition \n In section of its \n RFC \n the \n IETF \n classifies specifications that have been developed in a manner similar to that of the IETF itself as being \"open standards \" and lists the standards produced by \n ANSI \n ISO \n IEEE \n and \n ITU-T \n as examples As the IETF standardization processes and IPR policies have the characteristics listed above by ITU-T the IETF standards fulfill the ITU-T definition of \"open standards \" \n However the IETF has not adopted a specific definition of \"open standard\" both \n RFC \n and the IETF's mission statement \n RFC \n talks about \"open process \" but \n RFC \n does not define \"open standard\" except for the purpose of defining what documents IETF standards can link to \n RFC \n belongs to a set of RFCs collectively known as BCP Best Common Practice an IETF policy \n RFC \n was later updated by BCP and among others As of BCP is \n RFC \n Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust \n and BCP consists of \n RFC \n Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology and a clarification in \n RFC \n The changes are intended to be compatible with the \"Simplified \n BSD \n License\" as stated in the IETF Trust Legal Provisions and Copyright FAQ based on \n RFC \n In August the IETF combined with the W3C and \n IEEE \n to launch OpenStand \n and to publish The Modern Paradigm for Standards This captures \"the effective and efficient standardization processes that have made the Internet and Web the premiere platforms for innovation and borderless commerce\" The declaration is then published in the form of \n RFC \n in January \n European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services \n The \n European Union \n defined the term for use within its European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services Version \n although it does not claim to be a universal definition for all \n European Union \n use and documentation \n To reach interoperability in the context of pan-European eGovernment services guidance needs to focus on open standards \n The word \"open\" is here meant in the sense of fulfilling the following requirements \n The standard is adopted and will be maintained by a not-for-profit organization and its ongoing development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure available to all interested parties consensus or majority decision etc \n The standard has been published and the standard specification document is available either freely or at a nominal charge It must be permissible to all to copy distribute and use it for no fee or at a nominal fee \n The intellectual property - i e patents possibly present - of parts of the standard is made irrevocably available on a \n royalty-free \n basis \n There are no constraints on the re-use of the standard \n Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium definition \n The \n Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium \n NCOIC defines open standard as the following \n Specifications for hardware and/or software that are publicly available implying that multiple vendors can compete directly based on the features and performance of their products It also implies that the existing open system can be removed and replaced with that of another vendor with minimal effort and without major interruption \n Danish government definition \n The Danish government has attempted to make a definition of open standards \n which also is used in pan-European software development projects It states \n An open standard is accessible to everyone free of charge i e there is no discrimination between users and no payment or other considerations are required as a condition of use of the standard \n An open standard of necessity remains accessible and free of charge i e owners renounce their options if indeed such exist to limit access to the standard at a later date for example by committing themselves to openness during the remainder of a possible patent's life \n An open standard is accessible free of charge and documented in all its details i e all aspects of the standard are transparent and documented and both access to and use of the documentation is free \n French law definition \n The French Parliament approved a definition of \"open standard\" in its \"Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy \" \n The definition is \n By open standard is understood any communication interconnection or interchange protocol and any interoperable data format whose specifications are public and without any restriction in their access or implementation \n Indian Government Definition \n A clear Royalty Free stance and far reaching requirements case is the one for India's Government \n Mandatory Characteristics \n An Identified Standard will qualify as an Open Standard if it meets the following criteria \n Specification document of the Identified Standard shall be available with or without a nominal fee \n The Patent claims necessary to implement the Identified Standard shall be made available on a Royalty-Free basis for the life time of the Standard \n Identified Standard shall be adopted and maintained by a not-for-profit organization wherein all stakeholders can opt to participate in a transparent collaborative and consensual manner \n Identified Standard shall be recursively open as far as possible \n Identified Standard shall have technology-neutral specification \n Identified Standard shall be capable of localization support where applicable for all Indian official Languages for all applicable domains \n Italian Law definition \n Italy has a general rule for the entire public sector dealing with Open Standards although concentrating on data formats in Art of the Code of the Digital Administration \n Codice dell'Amministrazione Digitale \n applications must allow representation of data under different formats at least one being an open data format \n it is defined an open data format a data format which is made public is thoroughly documented and neutral with regard to the technological tools needed to peruse the same data \n Spanish law definition \n A Law passed by the Spanish Parliament \n requires that all electronic services provided by the Spanish public administration must be based on open standards It defines an open standard as royalty free according to the following definition \n An open standard fulfills the following conditions \n it is public and its use is available on a free gratis basis or at a cost that does not imply a difficulty for the user \n its use is not subject to the payment of any intellectual copyright or industrial patents and trademarks property right \n Venezuelan law definition \n The Venezuelan Government approved a \"free software and open standards law \" \n The decree includes the requirement that the Venezuelan public sector must use free software based on open standards and includes a definition of open standard \n Article for the purposes of this Decree it shall be understood as \n k Open standards technical specifications published and controlled by an organization in charge of their development that have been accepted by the industry available to everybody for their implementation in free software or other type of software promoting competitivity interoperability and flexibility \n South African Government definition \n The South African Government approved a definition in the \"Minimum Interoperability Operating Standards Handbook\" MIOS \n For the purposes of the MIOS a standard shall be considered open if it meets all of these criteria There are standards which we are obliged to adopt for pragmatic reasons which do not necessarily fully conform to being open in all respects In such cases where an open standard does not yet exist the degree of openness will be taken into account when selecting an appropriate standard \n it should be maintained by a non-commercial organization \n participation in the ongoing development work is based on decision making processes that are open to all interested parties \n open access all may access committee documents drafts and completed standards free of cost or for a negligible fee \n It must be possible for everyone to copy distribute and use the standard free of cost \n The intellectual rights required to implement the standard e g essential patent claims are irrevocably available without any royalties attached \n There are no reservations regarding reuse of the standard \n There are multiple implementations of the standard \n New Zealand official interoperability framework definition \n The E-Government Interoperability Framework e-GIF \n defines open standard as royalty free according to the following text \n While a universally agreed definition of \"open standards\" is unlikely to be resolved in the near future the e-GIF accepts that a definition of open standards needs to recognise a continuum that ranges from closed to open and encompasses varying degrees of \"openness \" To guide readers in this respect the e-GIF endorses \"open standards\" that exhibit the following properties \n Be accessible to everyone free of charge no discrimination between users and no payment or other considerations should be required as a condition to use the standard \n Remain accessible to everyone free of charge owners should renounce their options if any to limit access to the standard at a later date \n Be documented in all its details all aspects of the standard should be transparent and documented and both access to and use of the documentation should be free \n The e-GIF performs the same function in e-government as the Road Code does on the highways Driving would be excessively costly inefficient and ineffective if road rules had to be agreed each time one vehicle encountered another \n Bruce Perens' definition \n One of the most popular definitions of the term \"open standard \" as measured by Google ranking is the one developed by \n Bruce Perens \n His \n definition \n lists a set of principles that he believes must be met by an open standard \n Availability Open Standards are available for all to read and implement \n Maximize End-User Choice Open Standards create a fair competitive market for implementations of the standard They do not lock the customer into a particular vendor or group \n No Royalty Open Standards are free for all to \n implement \n with no royalty or fee \n Certification \n of compliance by the standards organization may involve a fee \n No Discrimination Open Standards and the organizations that administer them do not favor one implementor over another for any reason other than the technical standards compliance of a vendors implementation Certification organizations must provide a path for low and zero-cost implementations to be validated but may also provide enhanced certification services \n Extension or Subset Implementations of Open Standards may be extended or offered in subset form However certification organizations may decline to certify subset implementations and may place requirements upon extensions see \n Predatory Practices \n Predatory Practices Open Standards may employ license terms that protect against subversion of the standard by \n embrace-and-extend \n tactics The licenses attached to the standard may require the publication of reference information for extensions and a license for all others to create distribute and sell software that is compatible with the extensions An Open Standard may not otherwise prohibit extensions \n Microsoft's definition \n Vijay Kapoor national technology officer \n Microsoft \n defines what open standards are as follows \n Let's look at what an open standard means 'open' refers to it being royalty-free while 'standard' means a technology approved by formalized committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate on a consensus basis An open standard is publicly available and developed approved and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process \n Overall Microsoft's relationship to open standards is at best mixed While Microsoft participates in the most significant standard-setting organizations that establish open standards it is often seen as oppositional to their adoption \n The model started to shift however in and since the XML standard Microsoft has been earning a better reputation within the open-source and open-standards community \n Open Source Initiative's definition \n The \n Open Source Initiative \n defines the requirements and criteria for open standards as follows \n The Requirement \n An \"open standard\" must not prohibit conforming implementations in open source software \n The Criteria \n To comply with the Open Standards Requirement an \"open standard\" must satisfy the following criteria If an \"open standard\" does not meet these criteria it will be discriminating against open source developers \n No Intentional Secrets The standard MUST NOT withhold any detail necessary for interoperable implementation As flaws are inevitable the standard MUST define a process for fixing flaws identified during implementation and interoperability testing and to incorporate said changes into a revised version or superseding version of the standard to be released under terms that do not violate the OSR \n Availability The standard MUST be freely and publicly available e g from a stable web site under royalty-free terms at reasonable and non-discriminatory cost \n Patents All patents essential to implementation of the standard MUST \n be licensed under royalty-free terms for unrestricted use or \n be covered by a promise of non-assertion when practiced by open source software \n No Agreements There MUST NOT be any requirement for execution of a license agreement NDA grant click-through or any other form of paperwork to deploy conforming implementations of the standard \n No OSR-Incompatible Dependencies Implementation of the standard MUST NOT require any other technology that fails to meet the criteria of this Requirement \n Ken Krechmer's definition \n Ken Krechmer \n identifies ten \"rights\" \n Open Meeting \n Consensus \n Due Process \n Open IPR \n One

\"the effective and efficient standardization processes that have made the Internet and Web the premiere platforms for innovation and borderless commerce\" \n Digital Standards Organization definition \n The \n Digital Standards Organization \n DIGISTAN states that \"an open standard must be aimed at creating unrestricted competition between vendors and unrestricted choice for users \" \n Its brief definition of \"open standard\" or \"free and open standard\" is \"a published specification that is immune to vendor capture at all stages in its life-cycle \" Its more complete definition as follows \n \"The standard is adopted and will be maintained by a not-for-profit organization and its ongoing development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure available to all interested parties \n The standard has been published and the standard specification document is available freely It must be permissible to all to copy distribute and use it freely \n The patents possibly present on parts of the standard are made irrevocably available on a royalty-free basis \n There are no constraints on the re-use of the standard \n A key defining property is that an open standard is immune to vendor capture at all stages in its life-cycle Immunity from vendor capture makes it possible to improve upon trust and extend an open standard over time \" \n This definition is based on the EU's EIF v1 definition of \"open standard \" but with changes to address what it terms as \"vendor capture \" They believe that \"Many groups and individuals have provided definitions for 'open standard' that reflect their economic interests in the standards process We see that the fundamental conflict is between vendors who seek to capture markets and raise costs and the market at large which seeks freedom and lower costs Vendors work hard to turn open standards into franchise standards They work to change the statutory language so they can cloak franchise standards in the sheep's clothing of 'open standard ' A robust definition of \"free and open standard\" must thus take into account the direct economic conflict between vendors and the market at large \" \n Free Software Foundation Europe's definition \n The \n Free Software Foundation Europe \n FSFE uses a \n definition \n which is based on the \n European Interoperability Framework \n v and was extended after consultation with industry and community stakeholders FSFE's standard has been adopted by groups such as the \n SELF \n EU Project the Geneva Declaration on Standards and the Future of the Internet and international \n Document Freedom Day \n teams \n According to this definition an Open Standard is a format or protocol that is \n Subject to full public assessment and use without constraints in a manner equally available to all parties \n Without any components or extensions that have dependencies on formats or protocols that do not meet the definition of an Open Standard themselves \n Free from legal or technical clauses that limit its utilisation by any party or in any business model \n Managed and further developed independently of any single vendor in a process open to the equal participation of competitors and third parties \n Available in multiple complete implementations by competing vendors or as a complete implementation equally available to all parties \n FFII's definition \n The \n Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure \n 's definition is said \n by whom? \n to coincide with the definition issued in the European Interoperability Framework released in \n A specification that is public the standard is inclusive and it has been developed and is maintained in an open standardization process everybody can implement it without any restriction neither payment to license the IPR granted to everybody for free and without any condition This is the minimum license terms asked by standardization bodies as W3C Of course all the other bodies accept open standards But specification itself could cost a fair amount of money ie 100-400Eur per copy as in ISO because copyright and publication of the document itself \n UK government definition \n The UK government's definition of open standards applies to software interoperability data and document formats The criteria for open standards are published in the \n Open Standards Principles \n policy paper and are as follows \n Collaboration - the standard is maintained through a collaborative decision-making process that is consensus based and independent of any individual supplier Involvement in the development and maintenance of the standard is accessible to all interested parties \n Transparency - the decision-making process is transparent and a publicly accessible review by subject matter experts is part of the process \n Due process - the standard is adopted by a specification or standardisation organisation or a forum or consortium with a feedback and ratification process to ensure quality \n Fair access - the standard is published thoroughly documented and publicly available at zero or low cost Zero cost is preferred but this should be considered on a case by case basis as part of the selection process Cost should not be prohibitive or likely to cause a barrier to a level playing field \n Market support - other than in the context of creating innovative solutions the standard is mature supported by the market and demonstrates platform application and vendor independence \n Rights - rights essential to implementation of the standard and for interfacing with other implementations which have adopted that same standard are licensed on a royalty free basis that is compatible with both open source and proprietary licensed solutions These rights should be irrevocable unless there is a breach of licence conditions \n Comparison of definitions \n Publisher \n Time of publication \n Availability \n Usage rights \n Process \n Completeness \n The

and non-discriminatory \n RAND \n licensing \n for the use of patented technology in \n web standards \n increased \n Bruce Perens \n important associations as \n FSF \n or \n FFII \n and others have argued that the use of \n patents \n restricts who can implement a standard to those able or willing to pay for the use of the patented technology The \n requirement \n to pay some small amount per user is often an insurmountable problem for free/open source software implementations which can be redistributed by anyone \n Royalty free \n RF licensing is generally the only possible license for free/open source software implementations Version of the \n GNU General Public License \n includes a section that enjoins anyone who distributes a program released under the GPL from enforcing patents on subsequent users of the software or derivative works \n One result of this controversy was that many governments including the Danish French and Spanish governments singly and the EU collectively specifically affirmed that \"open standards\" required royalty-free licenses Some standards organizations such as the \n W3C \n modified their processes to essentially only permit royalty-free licensing \n Patents for \n software formulas and algorithms \n are currently enforceable in the US but not in the EU The \n European Patent Convention Article paragraph c \n expressly prohibits algorithms business methods and software from being covered by patents The US has only allowed them since and there has been growing controversy in recent years as to either the benefit or feasibility \n A standards body and its associated processes cannot \n force \n a patent holder to give up its right to charge license fees especially if the company concerned is not a member of the standards body and unconstrained by any rules that were set during the standards development process In fact this element discourages some standards bodies from adopting an \"open\" approach fearing that they will lose out if their members are more constrained than non-members Few bodies will carry out or require their members to carry out a full patent search Ultimately the only sanctions a standards body can apply on a non-member when patent licensing is demanded is to cancel the standard try to rework around it or work to invalidate the patent Standards bodies such as W3C and OASIS require \n citation needed \n that the use of required patents be granted under a royalty-free license as a condition for joining the body or a particular working group and this is generally considered enforceable \n citation needed \n Examples of patent claims brought against standards previously thought to be open include \n JPEG \n and the \n Rambus \n case over \n DDR SDRAM \n The \n H video codec \n is an example of a standards organization producing a standard that has known non-royalty-free required patents \n Often the scope of the standard itself determines how likely it is that a firm will be able to use a standard as patent-like protection Richard Langlois argues that standards with a wide scope may offer a firm some level of protection from competitors but it is likely that Schumpeterian creative destruction will ultimately leave the firm open to being \"invented around\" regardless of the standard a firm may benefit from \n Quotes \n EU Commissioner \n Erkki Liikanen \n \"Open standards are important to help create interoperable and affordable solutions for everybody They also promote competition by setting up a technical playing field that is level to all market players This means lower costs for enterprises and ultimately the consumer \" \n World Standards Day \n October \n Jorma Ollila Chairman of Nokia's Board of Directors \" Open standards and platforms

\" \n W3C Director \n Tim Berners-Lee \n \"The decision to make the Web an open system was necessary for it to be universal You can't propose that something be a universal space and at the same time

management initiative or form of \n economic strategy \n that brings different parties together for instance a company and a group of customers in order to jointly produce a mutually valued outcome \n Co-creation brings the unique blend of ideas from direct customers or viewers who are not the direct users of the product which in turn gives a plethora of new ideas to the organisation \n Co-created value arises in the form of personalized unique experiences for the customer value-in-use and ongoing revenue learning and enhanced market performance drivers for the firm loyalty relationships customer word of mouth Value is co-created with customers if and when a customer is able to personalize his or her experience using a firm's product-service proposition in the lifetime of its use to a level that is best suited to get his or her job s or tasks done and which allows the firm to derive greater value from its product-service investment in the form of new knowledge higher revenues/profitability and/or superior brand value/loyalty \n Scholars \n C K Prahalad \n and \n Venkat Ramaswamy \n popularized the concept in their \n Harvard Business Review \n article \"Co-Opting Customer Competence\" \n They developed their arguments further in their book published by the \n Harvard Business School Press \n The Future of Competition \n where they offered examples including \n Napster \n and \n Netflix \n showing that customers would no longer be satisfied with making yes or no decisions on what a company offers \n Within the study of Prahalad and Ramaswamy \n they defined co-creation as \n The joint creation of value by the company and the customer allowing the customer to co-construct the service experience to suit their context Prahalad and Ramaswamy p \n The process of Co-creation \n The process of co-creation essentially involves core steps \n Contribution \n Submission of contributions by the public to the firm \n Selection \n Selection of the most promising and appealing contributions/submissions \n Types of Co-creation \n Depending on the degree of control exercised by the firm/public over the contribution and selection activities co-creation may be broadly classified into categories \n Tinkering \n Public exercises control over the contribution activity while the firm exercises control over the selection activity \n Submitting \n Firm exercises complete control over both the activities \n Co-designing \n Firm exercises control over the contribution activity while the public exercises control over the contribution activity \n Collaborating \n Public exercises complete control over both the activities \n Tinkering \n Tinkering is a customer co-creation model that involves procurement of contributions from the public by the firm a comprehensive and scrupulous examination of the contributions selection of the most promising and enterprising contributions by the firm and finally implementation of the contributions For example Little big planet a puzzle platform video game by Sony Computer Entertainment allows the gamers to create their own levels in the game The created levels can then be shared with other gamers or submitted to Sony Owing to this \"Create and Share\" feature this game has the tagline 'Play Create Share' The most promising contributions are incorporated into the final game and the contributors are rewarded \n Submitting \n In case of submitting the firm exercises control over the contribution activity by placing constraints on the basic design contribution size etc and also the selection activity by selecting the winning contributions \n Co-designing \n Co-designing involves placement of constraints by the firm on the contribution activity and selection of the winning contributions by the contributors themselves For example Local Motors employs the co-designing model of customer co-creation to develop its vehicles In Local Motors developed a car named Rally Fighter in a record months which is about times faster than what a conventional car manufacturing process takes By empowering a community of over designers to submit their designs while still placing some constraints on the basic design color schemes etc Local Motors effectively utilized the co-designing model of customer co-creation The winning designing By Sangho Kim was chosen as the winning design by the designer community through voting \n Interesting Trivia Local Motors is that it doesn't even have a design team All the designing is done by the public itself \n Threadless one of the leading T-shirt manufacturing brands in America also employs co-designing \n Collaborating \n Also known as open sourcing collaborating involves releasing the source code of the product and making it accessible to the general public The released source code is then open to modification as per the requirement of the users Example Mozilla Firefox Apache Linux are all based on collaborating \n The four building blocks of interaction \n From co-production \n Early applications \n Digital era types of customer co-creation \n Corporate management \n The rise of customer co-creation \n Process \n Challenges \n Further reading \n The four building blocks of interaction \n Prahalad and Ramaswamy \n suggested that in order to apply co-creation the following fundamental requirements should be prepared in advance \n Terms \n Definition \n Managerial Implication \n Dialogue \n Interaction between customer \n Two-way connection instead of one-way selling strategy \n Access \n Allow customer to access the data \n Create value with customer beyond traditional value chain process \n Risk-benefit \n To monitor risk and gaps between customer and firm \n Share the risk of product development with guest through communication In later work of Ramaswamy \n this is replaced by \"reflexivity\" \n Transparency \n Information among business is accessible \n Information barriers should be eliminated to certain degree in order to gain trust from guest \n From co-production \n In their review of the literature on \"customer participation in production\" Neeli Bendapudi and Robert P Leone found that the first academic work dates back to \n From onwards new themes are emerging \n John Czepiel \n suggests that customer's participation may lead to greater customer's satisfaction \n Scott Kelley James Donnelly and Steven J Skinner are dealing with productivity but suggest other ways to look at customer participation quality employee's performance and emotional responses \n Although not reviewed by Bendapuli and Leone the groundbreaking article by R Normann and R Ramirez suggests that successful companies do not focus on themselves or even on the industry but on the value-creating system \n Michel Vargo and Lusch recognize the influence of Normann on their own work and acknowledge similarity between the concepts of co-production and co-creation \"his customer co-production mirrors the similar concept found in FP6\" \n The authors suggest that Normann enriched the S-D Logic particularly through his idea of \"density\" of offerings \n In a letter sent to the editor of the \n Harvard Business Review \n in reaction to an article by Pine Peppers and Roger \"Do you want to keep your customers forever\" Michael Schrage argues that not all customers are alike in their capacity to bring some kind of knowledge to the firm \n Wikstrm sees the role of consumers changing \n Firat Fuat Dholakia and Venkatesh introduced the concept of customerization which is a buyer-centric evolution of the mass-customization process and stated that it enables consumers to serve as \"the co-producer of the product and service offering\" \n However Bendapudi and Leone concluded in an empirical paper that \"the assumption of greater customization under co-production may hold only when the customer has the expertise to craft a good or service to his or her liking\" \n At the turn of the century Prahalad and Ramaswamy produced another important piece of work and built further on Normann and Ramirez's ideas \n In Prahalad and Ramaswamy kept working on their original idea published four years earlier \n At the same time Vargo and Lush published on the service-dominant logic of marketing The process of value creation is dealt with in FP6 Opposing the goods-dominant logic and the service-dominant logic the authors state \"the customer is always a coproducer\" FP6 will be later Vargo and Lush altered in \"the customer is always a co-creator\" \n Prahalad commented in an issue of the \n Journal of Marketing \n on Vargo and Lusch's FP6 and found that the authors did not go far enough \n In the same book Kalaignanam and Varadarajan also follow Prahalad's comments and elaborate on the IT implications on coproduction As the authors put it \"developments in information technology enable customers to create value by collaborating with the firm\" The main contribution of the authors in this article is a conceptual model of the intensity of customer participation as function of product characteristics market and customer characteristics firm characteristics In their conclusions and directions for future research the authors deal with three promising topics First they propose to study supply-side issues and how increasing communication participation from the customers and the emergence of communities enable customers to interact between them sometimes leading to new creations Second they see the \"locus of innovation\" as of interest and in particular how the shift of firm-centric networks to user-centric networks can lead to increased innovation capabilities Third they wonder whether demand-side issues may not result in negative consequences on satisfaction The third issue is already mentioned by Bendapuli and Leone \"A customer who believes he or she has the expertise and chooses to co-produce may be more likely to make self-attributions for success and failure than a customer who lacks the expertise A customer who lacks the expertise but feels forced to co-produce may make more negative attributions about co-production\" \n Early applications \n In the early 2000s consultants and companies deployed co-creation as a tool for engaging customers in product design Examples include \n Nike \n giving customers online tools to design their own sneakers At a \n MacWorld \n conference in \n Sam Lucente \n the legendary design and innovation guru at \n Hewlett-Packard \n described his epiphany that designers can no longer design products alone using their brilliance and magic They are no longer in the business of product and service design he stated they are really in the business of customer co-creation \n During the mid-2000s co-creation became a driving concept in social media and marketing techniques where companies such as \n Converse \n persuaded large numbers of its most passionate customers to create their own video advertisements for the product The \n Web \n phenomenon encompassed many forms of co-creation marketing as social and consumer communities became \"ambassadors\" \" \n buzz agents \n \" \" \n smart mobs \n \" and \"participants\" transforming the product experience Other examples of co-creation can be found in arts \n Digital era types of customer co-creation \n Types of co-creation \n According to recent research conducted by Aric Rindfleisch and his former doctoral student Matt O'Hearn customer co-creation was categorized into four different types based on a two-by-two matrix It was based on two key steps in the customer co-creation process The X axis had the contribution step towards the idea creation/suggestion The Y-axis had the selection step for the proposed ideas And each of this axis had both a high and a low degree of customer control over each process Under contribution the first box was fixed which means that the customer has very little control over the contribution process and the firm will fix the types of contribution that it wants On selection under the firm-led process it was largely the firm that does the selection activity and the firm pick the winning submissions In the customer-led category the firm relies more on the customers to select the winning submissions \n Thus defining the four types of customer co-creation as below \n Submission This section has the least contribution in terms of idea submission by the customer and holds a high degree of firm-led selection in the limited ideas proposed by customer \n Tinkering a unique type of co-creation where the customer comes up with a variety of ideas for the organization whereas the selection is defined by multiple parameters of the firm In tinkering the firm usually releases a final product e g \n Little Big Planet \n video games by Sony Although the users create the platform the firm decides which ones get published and distributed \n Collaborative a mix of leveraging both the firm and users to conclude with the final idea Customer has full liberty to suggest and select the idea along with the combined efforts of the firm E g Apache Server is a completely open source tool available on the web for all customers \n Co-designing the customer approach to select the limited ideas given by the customers Any community forum where customers have to give ideas into defined areas e g for website of any company etc whereas the final idea is selected by the community forum by liking/disliking the proposed idea e g Threadless-where customer designs the T-shirt with his own innovation and idea whereas the firm restricts the customer to design only T-shirts and the final selection is done by the firm itself but customers have a strong voice in selecting contributions that move forward \n Corporate management \n During the mid-2000s these innovations in customer engagement and collaboration expanded and morphed into global economic trends including the co-created development of products and services Authors published bestselling books developing theories influenced by \"co-creation\" and customer collaboration Major concepts included \n crowdsourcing \n coined by Jeff Howe in a June \n Wired \n magazine article \n open innovation \n promoted by \n Henry Chesbrough \n a professor and executive director at the \n Garwood Center for Corporate Innovation at Berkeley \n and consultant \n Don Tapscott \n 's and \n Anthony D Williams \n 's \n Wikinomics How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything \n a book that popularized the concept of corporations using mass collaboration and open source innovation \n Of this rapid morphing of co-creation Ramaswamy and his co-author \n Francis Gouillart \n wrote \"Through their interactions with thousands of managers globally who had begun experimenting with co-creation they discovered that enterprises were building platforms that engaged not only the firm and its customers but also the entire network of suppliers partners and employees in a continuous development of new experiences with individuals \" \n The rise of customer co-creation \n The rise of cocreation could be attributed to three distinct issues as suggested by O'hern & Rindfleisch \n The information asymmetry between customer demands and manufacturer capability \n Customer empowerment \n The advent and widespread application of digital technology \n Process \n Successful co-creation requires two key steps \n Contribution of ideas A firm must convince its customers to submit their ideas i e to contribute However receiving contribution is actually quite hard because most customers are quite busy and hardly care about the company's call Unless customers are incentivized in an attractive way they are reluctant to participate and benefit the company As a result most co-creation efforts fail because they don't get many submissions \n Selecting the viable ideas After receiving the contributions the firm must then select the most profitable viable and implementable ones The challenge of the selection process is that most submissions are not very useful impractical and difficult to implement Firms have to deal the submitted ideas in a very subtle way as throughout the process they don't want to reject customer submissions and risk of alienating them which may eventually lead to customer

\"Design Global Manufacture Local\" is a new model of \n socioeconomic \n production in which physical objects are produced in an open collaborative and distributed manner \n and based on \n open design \n and \n open source principles \n Open manufacturing combines the following elements of a production process new open production tools and methods such as \n 3D printers \n new value-based movements such as the \n maker movement \n new institutions and networks for manufacturing and production such as \n FabLabs \n and open source methods software and protocols \n Open manufacturing may also include digital modeling and fabrication and \n computer numeric control \n CNC of the machines used for production through \n open source software \n and \n open source hardware \n The philosophy of open manufacturing is close to the \n open-source movement \n but aims at the development of physical products rather than software \n The term is linked to the notion of democratizing technology \n as embodied in the \n Maker culture \n the \n DIY ethic \n the \n open source appropriate technology \n movement the Fablab-network and other rooms for grassroot innovation such as \n hackerspaces \n According to scholar \n Michel Bauwens \n Open Manufacturing is \"the expansion of \n peer production \n to the world of physical production\" \n Redlich and Bruns define \"Open Production\" as \"a new form of coordination for production systems that implies a superior broker system coordinating the information and material flows between the stakeholders of production\" and which will encompass the entire value creation process for physical goods development manufacturing sales support etc \n A policy paper commissioned by the European Commission uses the term \"maker manufacturing\" and positions it between social innovation open source ICT and manufacturing \n Principles \n Socioeconomic implications \n Criticism \n Examples \n Principles \n The Openness of \"open manufacturing\" may relate to the nature of the product \n open design \n to the nature of the production machines and methods e g open source \n 3D-printers \n open source \n CNC \n to the process of production and innovation \n commons-based peer production \n / collaborative / \n distributed manufacturing \n or to new forms of value creation network-based bottom-up or hybrid versus business-centric top down \n Jeremy Rifkin argues that open production through 3D-printing \"will eventually and inevitably reduce marginal costs to near zero eliminate profit and make property exchange in markets unnecessary for many though not all products\" \n Socioeconomic implications \n The following points are seen as key implications of open manufacturing \n a democratization of the means of production \n a decentralization of production and local value creation global cooperation local manufacturing \n the possibility to produce high quality prototypes and products in small quantities at moderate to increasingly low prices \n the closing of the gap between the formal and informal sector and opportunities for bottom-up \n open innovation \n and \n a transition from consumer to producer for manufactured goods \n In the context of \n socioeconomic development \n open manufacturing has been described as a path towards a more sustainable industrialization on a global scale that promotes \"social sustainability\" and provides the opportunity to shift to a \"collaboration-oriented industrialization driven by stakeholders from countries with different development status connected in a global value creation at eye level\" \n For developing countries open production could notably lead to products more adapted to local problems and local markets and reduce dependencies on foreign goods as vital products could be manufactured locally \n In such a context open manufacturing is strongly linked to the broader concept of \n Open Source Appropriate Technology \n movement \n Criticism \n A number of factors are seen to hamper the broad-based application of the model of \"open manufacturing\" and / or to realize its positive implications for more sustainable global production pattern \n The first factor is the sustainability of commons-based peer production models \"Empowerment happens only if the participants are willing to share their knowledge with their colleagues The participation of the actors cannot be guaranteed thus there are many cases known where participation could only be insufficiently realized\" \n Other problems include missing or inadequate systems of quality control the persistent paradigm of high-volume manufacturing and its cost-efficiency the lack of widely adopted platforms to share hardware designs as well as challenges linked to the joint-ownership paradigm behind the open licences of open manufacturing and the fact that hardware is much more difficult to share and to standardize than e g software \n In developing countries a number of factors need to be considered in addition to the points above Scholar Waldman-Brown names the following lack of manufacturing expertise and informality of current SMMs in emerging markets as an obstacle to quality control for final products and raw material as well as universities and vocational training programs not apt to react rapidly enough to provide the necessary knowledge and qualifications \n Examples \n Open Source Ecology \n a project for designing and building open source industrial machines fabricated by \n eXtreme Manufacturing \n

template message \n A \n Polycom \n phone made specifically for conference calls \n A \n conference call \n is a \n telephone call \n in which someone talks to several people at the same time The conference calls may be designed to allow the called party to participate during the call or the call may be set up so that the called party merely listens into the call and cannot speak It is sometimes called \n ATC \n audio tele-conference \n Conference calls can be designed so that the calling party calls the other participants and adds them to the call however participants are usually able to call into the conference call themselves by dialing a telephone number that connects to a \"conference bridge\" a specialized type of equipment that links telephone lines \n Companies commonly use a specialized service provider who maintains the conference bridge or who provides the phone numbers and PIN codes that participants dial to access the meeting or conference call \n The more limited \n three-way calling \n is available usually at an extra charge on home or office phone lines For a three-way call the first called party is dialed Then the \n hook flash \n button or recall button is pressed and the other \n called party \n 's phone number is dialed While it is ringing flash/recall is pressed again to connect the three people together This option allows callers to add a second outgoing call to an already connected call \n Usage \n Business \n Flat-rate conferencing \n Prepaid conference calls \n Free conference calling \n Premium conferencing \n Conferencing in IMS \n Usage \n Business \n Businesses use conference calls daily to meet with remote parties both internally and outside of their company Common applications are client meetings or sales presentations project meetings and updates regular team meetings training classes and communication to employees who work in different locations Conference calling is viewed as a primary means of cutting travel costs and allowing workers to be more productive by not having to go out-of-office for meetings \n Conference calls are used by nearly all \n United States \n public corporations \n to report their quarterly results These calls usually allow for questions from \n stock analysts \n and are called \n earnings calls \n A standard conference call begins with a disclaimer stating that anything said in the duration of the call may be a \n forward-looking statement \n and that results may vary significantly The \n CEO \n CFO or investor relations officer then will read the company's quarterly report Lastly the call is opened for questions from analysts \n Conference calls are increasingly used in conjunction with web conferences where presentations or documents are shared via the internet This allows people on the call to view content such as corporate reports sales figures and company data presented by one of the participants The main benefit is that the presenter of the document can give clear explanations about details within the document while others simultaneously view the presentation Care should be taken not to mix video and audio source on the same network since the video feed can cause interruptions on sound quality \n It is important to pay attention to conference call etiquette when participating for example one should refrain from shouting and multitasking in certain cases Care should also be taken to schedule a call at a convenient time \n Business conference calls are usually hosted or operator-assisted with a variety of features \n Conference calls are also beginning to cross over into the world of \n podcasting \n and \n social networking \n which in turn fosters new kinds of interaction patterns Live streaming or broadcasting of conference calls allows a larger audience access to the call without dialing into a bridge In addition organizers of conference calls can publish a dial-in number alongside the audio stream creating potential for audience members to dial in and interact \n The UK government has changed flexible working rights since so that employees who have been working full-time for a company or organisation can lawfully request \n flexible working \n In recent years there has been a number of different types of flexible working options as a result of conference calling technology enabling employees to work remotely \n Flat-rate conferencing \n Flat-rate conferencing \n services are being offered which give unlimited access to a conference bridge at a fixed monthly cost Because telecommunication carriers offer free long-distance bundled with local service this alternative is gaining widespread popularity for budget conscious businesses and non-profits \n In the UK there are conference services offered on a \n pay-as-you-go \n basis where the cost of the phone calls using 0843/0844 or 0871/0872 non-geographic revenue sharing numbers from each of the participants covers the cost of the conference service With this service type there is no monthly charge and usually no contracts to sign \n Prepaid conference calls \n Prepaid conference call services allow businesses and individuals to purchase conferencing services online \n and conduct conference calls on a \n pay-as-you-go \n basis Typically a conference call \n PIN \n and its associated calling instructions are displayed immediately online after being purchased and/or sent via email Generally prepaid conference call services are used with a landline telephone mobile phone or computer and there is no need to buy additional expensive telecommunications hardware or add/switch long distance service Some services allow one to start or join a conference call from virtually any country worldwidewith appropriate telephone access \n Large telecommunications providers such as \n AT&T \n Embarq \n formerly Sprint \n Verizon \n and other large to medium conferencing service providers maintain a dominant position in the conferencing niche servicing many of the world's biggest brands However the Internet and improved global \n VoIP \n networks have helped to significantly reduce the barrier of entry into this niche \n Free conference calling \n Free conferencing is different from traditional conference calling in that it has no organizer fees and allows for multiple people to meet for the price of their long distance connections Companies that provide free conference call services are usually compensated through a revenue sharing arrangement with the local phone company sharing the terminating access charge for all incoming calls to a phone carrier \n Some background on the terminating access charge On every long distance call in the United States including toll conference calls the consumer is paying for origination dial tone transport and termination connecting the call \n Each of these phone companies share a piece of the cost of the call If it is the same phone company performing all three tasks most likely the two largest phone companies AT&T and Verizon they keep all of the charge This is known as intercarrier compensation ICC and is intended to keep the telecommunications system functioning by having every phone company receive compensation for using their network \n In the case of free conference calling the conferencing company strikes an agreement with the local phone company that hosts the conferencing bridge to receive a share of the terminating access charge received for connecting the call At large carriers such as AT&T and Verizon they keep these access charges for their own conferencing services in addition to charging the customer for the conference service With free conference calling as mentioned above there are no organizer fees so these services do not double-dip the consumer pays for a regular call with the same three components origination transport and termination of any call In other words the call costs the same as any other call under the customer's calling plan but the conferencing is included for free to the host and participants of the conference call \n This added competition in the conferencing market has brought average rates down from over cents per minute to under cents per minute In addition it is more efficient and less expensive to speak to many people on one call a conference call than on multiple person-to-person calls \n In November the \n Federal Communications Commission \n FCC published a 732-page Order on InterCarrier Compensation ICC \n including rules governing revenue sharing Citing Section b of the Telecommunications Act of the FCC mandated that terminating access rates for all calls not just conference calls be leveled in and then reduced in three increments over the subsequent three years until they reach $0 in \n These mostly sub-1 cent charges are replaced with an access recovery charge ARC that is added onto every customers' bill by their phone carriers In other words every phone company will get to keep the terminating access charges they had to pay out to connect each call while charging consumers more whether they make calls or not This order has been challenged at the Federal Appeals Court by several parties \n As for revenue sharing the order adds a measure for high volume call traffic which triggers an immediate terminating access charge reduction to the lowest rate of any carrier in that state \n In the United Kingdom the prefix was originally used by UK-based free conference calling providers in order to receive a rebate from every call from telephone company that owns the number However in April Ofcom the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications industries announced that the rebate that is payable to the telecom's supplier when an number is used would be removed \n Systems were soon moved to and prefixes in order to retain the revenue sharing arrangement \n Recently in the UK a very small number of conference call providers have begun to use numbers which are included in bundled minutes under Ofcom regulations \n This has provided the option to hold conference calls without any costs whatsoever as call are included in the minutes bundles provided by most UK network operators There is a general trend for companies in the UK to more to numbers for inbound services because these numbers are more palatable to the caller \n A distinct difference between sound quality of paid and free conference calls has been noted by customers who have claimed to hear background noises when using the free conferencing services which rarely happens on paid conference calling services \n Premium conferencing \n Here participants dial in on a premium-rate number such as a toll free number in the US The conference is typically hosted by the party that perceives value in the call in order to justify the cost this could be a business owner a non-profit board member an educator lawyer or expert in any given field That person then usually pays for the cost of the call Premium conferencing can also be used for charitable fundraisers \n Premium Conferencing Feature Sets \n Reservationless or operator

started around by \n Bruce Perens \n creator of the \n Open Source Definition \n co-founder of the \n Open Source Initiative \n and a \n ham radio operator \n He launched the Open Hardware Certification Program which had the goal of allowing hardware manufacturers to self-certify their products as open \n Shortly after the launch of the Open Hardware Certification Program David Freeman announced the Open Hardware Specification Project OHSpec another attempt at licensing hardware components whose interfaces are available publicly and of creating an entirely new computing platform as an alternative to proprietary computing systems \n In early Sepehr Kiani Ryan Vallance and Samir Nayfeh joined efforts to apply the open source philosophy to machine design applications Together they established the Open Design Foundation ODF as a non-profit corporation and set out to develop an \n Open Design \n Definition But most of these activities faded out after a few years \n By the mid 2000s open source hardware again became a hub of activity due to the emergence of several major open source hardware projects and companies such as \n OpenCores \n RepRap \n 3D printing \n Arduino \n Adafruit \n and \n SparkFun \n In Perens reactivated the openhardware org website \n Following the \n Open Graphics Project \n an effort to design implement and manufacture a free and open 3D graphics chip set and reference graphics card Timothy Miller suggested the creation of an organization to safeguard the interests of the Open Graphics Project community Thus Patrick McNamara founded the \n Open Hardware Foundation \n OHF in \n The \n Tucson Amateur Packet Radio Corporation \n TAPR founded in as a non-profit organization of amateur radio operators with the goals of supporting R&D efforts in the area of amateur digital communications created in the first open hardware license the \n TAPR Open Hardware License \n The \n OSI \n president \n Eric S Raymond \n expressed some concerns about certain aspects of the OHL and decided to not review the license \n Around in context of the \n Freedom Defined \n project the Open Hardware Definition was created as collaborative work of many \n and is accepted as of by dozens of organizations and companies \n In July CERN \n European Organization for Nuclear Research \n released an open source hardware license \n CERN OHL \n Javier Serrano an engineer at CERNs Beams Department and the founder of the Open Hardware Repository explained \n By sharing designs openly CERN expects to improve the quality of designs through peer review and to guarantee their users including commercial companies the freedom to study modify and manufacture them leading to better hardware and less duplication of efforts \n While initially drafted to address CERN-specific concerns such as tracing the impact of the organizations research in its current form it can be used by anyone developing open source hardware \n Following the Open Hardware Summit and after heated debates on licenses and what constitutes open source hardware Bruce Perens abandoned the OSHW Definition and the concerted efforts of those involved with it \n Openhardware org led by Bruce Perens promotes and identifies practices that meet all the combined requirements of the Open Source Hardware Definition the Open Source Definition and the Four Freedoms of the \n Free Software Foundation \n Since openhardware org is not online and seems to have ceased activity \n The \n Open Source Hardware Association \n OSHWA at oshwa org proposes \n Open source hardware \n and acts as hub of open source hardware activity of all genres while cooperating with other entities such as TAPR CERN and OSI The OSHWA was established as an organization in June in Delaware and filed for tax exemption status in July \n After same debates about trademark interferences with the OSI in the OSHWA and the OSI signed a co-existence agreement \n In after years of skepticism on the relevance of \n free hardware designs \n the \n Free Software Foundation \n started the \" \n Respects Your Freedom \n \" RYF computer hardware product certification program It was intended to encourage the creation and sale of hardware that respects users' freedom and privacy and aims to ensure that users have control over their devices \n RYF certified laptops faced criticism on the basis of being slow and outdated hardware \n FSF's \n Replicant \n project suggested in an alternative \"free hardware\" definition derived from the \n FSF's four freedoms \n On the term \n Hardware \n The term \n hardware \n in open source hardware has been historically used in opposition to the term \n software \n of open source software That is to refer to the electronic hardware on which the software runs see previous section However as more and more non-electronic hardware products are made open source for example \n Wikihouse \n OpenBeam \n or \n Hovalin \n this term tends to be used back in its broader sense of \"physical product \" In that sense \n hardware \n refers to any form of tangible product may it be electronic hardware mechanical hardware textile or even construction hardware The Open Source Hardware OSHW Definition defines hardware as \"tangible artifacts machines devices or other physical things \" \n Licenses \n Rather than creating a new license some open-source hardware projects simply use existing \n free and open-source software \n licenses \n These licenses may not accord well with \n patent law \n Later several new licenses have been proposed designed to address issues specific to hardware designs \n In these licenses many of the fundamental principles expressed in open-source software OSS licenses have been \"ported\" to their counterpart hardware projects New \n hardware licenses \n are often explained as the \"hardware equivalent\" of a well-known OSS license such as the \n GPL \n LGPL \n or \n BSD license \n Despite superficial similarities to \n software licenses \n most hardware licenses are fundamentally different by nature they typically rely more heavily on \n patent \n law than on \n copyright \n law as many hardware designs are not copyrightable \n Whereas a copyright license may control the distribution of the source code or design documents a patent license may control the use and manufacturing of the physical device built from the design documents This distinction is explicitly mentioned in the preamble of the \n TAPR Open Hardware License \n \" those who benefit from an OHL design may not bring lawsuits claiming that design infringes their patents or other intellectual property \" \n TAPR Open Hardware License \n Noteworthy licenses include \n The \n TAPR Open Hardware License \n drafted by attorney \n John Ackermann \n reviewed by OSS community leaders \n Bruce Perens \n and \n Eric S Raymond \n and discussed by hundreds of volunteers in an open community discussion \n Balloon Open Hardware License \n

open-source hardware is defined \n dead link \n ways to collaborate in hardware development as well as a model for \n sustainable development \n by making \n open-source appropriate technology \n In addition there has been considerable work to produce open-source hardware for scientific hardware using a combination of open-source electronics and \n 3-D printing \n One of the major differences between developing open-source software and developing open-source hardware is that hardware results in tangible outputs which cost money to prototype and manufacture As a result the phrase \"free as in speech not as in beer\" \n not in citation given \n more formally known as \n Gratis versus Libre \n distinguishes between the idea of zero cost and the freedom to use and modify information While open-source hardware faces challenges in minimizing cost and reducing financial risks for individual project developers some community members have proposed models to address these needs \n Given this there are initiatives to develop sustainable community funding mechanisms such as the Open Source Hardware Central Bank \n Often vendors of chips and other electronic components will sponsor contests with the provision that the participants and winners must share their designs \n Circuit Cellar \n magazine organizes some of these contests \n Open-source labs \n A guide has been published \n Open-Source Lab book \n by \n Joshua Pearce \n on using \n open-source electronics \n and \n 3D printing \n to make \n open-source labs \n Today scientists are creating many such labs examples include \n Boston Open Source Science Laboratory \n Somerville Massachusetts \n BYU Open Source Lab \n Brigham Young University \n Michigan Tech \n National Chiao Tung University \n OSU Open Source Lab \n Oregon State University \n Open Source Research Lab \n University of Texas \n at El Paso \n Open-source electronics \n One of the most popular types of open-source hardware is electronics There are numerous companies that provide large varieties of open-source electronics such as \n Sparkfun \n Adafruit \n and Seeed In addition there are \n NPOs \n and companies that provide a specific open-source electronic component such as the \n Arduino \n electronics prototyping platform There are numerous examples of speciality open-source electronics such as low-cost voltage and current GMAW open-source 3-D printer monitor \n and a robotics-assisted \n mass spectrometry \n assay platform \n Open-source electronics finds various uses including automation of chemical procedures \n Business models \n Open hardware companies are experimenting with different business models In one example \n littleBits \n implements open-source business models by making the design files available for the circuit designs in each littleBits module in accordance with the \n CERN Open Hardware License Version \n In another example \n Arduino \n has registered its name as a \n trademark \n Others may manufacture their designs but can't put the Arduino name on them Thus they can distinguish their products from others by appellation \n There are many applicable business models for implementing some open-source hardware even in traditional firms For example to accelerate development and technical innovation the \n photovoltaic \n industry has experimented with partnerships franchises secondary supplier and completely open-source models \n Recently many open source hardware projects were funded via \n crowdfunding \n on \n Indiegogo \n or \n Kickstarter \n Especially popular is \n Crowdsupply \n for crowdfunding open hardware projects \n Reception and impact \n Cover for \" \n Open-Source Lab \n \" by Joshua M Pearce \n Richard Stallman \n the founder of the \n Free Software \n movement was in skeptical on the idea and relevance of \n Free hardware \n his terminology what is now known as open-source hardware \n In a \n Wired \n article he adapted his point of view slightly while he still sees no ethical parallel between free software and free hardware he acknowledges the importance \n Also Stallman uses and suggest the term \n free hardware design \n over \n open source

Further reading \n Term Exploration \n The term started to appear in the mid-1990s in response to the twin trends of the growth in \n strategic alliances \n between private corporations and the formation of long term \n public private partnership \n contracts to rebuild \n public infrastructure \n citation needed \n Kurt Lewin was first to apply cooperative system in scientific method in about individual nutrition in the United States \n In her \n Harvard Business Review \n article \"Collaborative Advantage\" \n Rosabeth Moss Kanter \n talks about leaders who recognize that there are critical business relationships \"that cannot be controlled by formal systems but require a dense web of interpersonal connections \" \n And in a book published in that same year Chrislip and Larson looked at the attributes of great civic leaders in communities across the US and found some similar attributes \"Collaboration needs a different kind of leadership it needs leaders who can safeguard the process facilitate interaction and patiently deal with high levels of frustration\" \n In \n Harvard Business Review \n authors \n Nick Lovegrove \n and Matthew Thomas co-founders of The InterSector Project \n explore the complex relationship between the business government and social sectors as it relates to their role in addressing the most pressing challenges facing society issues like managing resource constraints controlling health care costs training the twenty-first-century workforce developing and implementing smart-grid and intelligent-urbanization technologies and stabilizing financial systems to foster sustainable economic growth Their research suggests that the future of collaborative leadership depends on the ability of leaders to engage and collaborate with the business government and social sectors see below for the distinguishing characteristics of such leaders \n Hank Rubin author and founder of the \n Institute of Collaborative Leadership \n has written \"A collaboration is a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to accomplish a shared outcome \" In his book \"Collaborative Leadership Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools\" Rubin asks \"Who is a collaborative leader?\" and answers \"You are a collaborative leader once you have accepted responsibility for building - or helping to ensure the success of - a heterogeneous team to accomplish a shared purpose Your tools are the purposeful exercise of your behavior communication and organizational resources in order to affect the perspective beliefs and behaviors of another person generally a collaborative partner to influence that person's relationship with you and your collaborative enterprise and the structure and climate of an environment that supports the collaborative relationship \" \n David Archer and Alex Cameron in their book \n Collaborative Leadership How to succeed in an interconnected world \n identify the basic task of the collaborative leader as the delivery of results across boundaries between different organisations They say \"Getting value from difference is at the heart of the collaborative leader's task they have to learn to share control and to trust a partner to deliver even though that partner may operate very differently from themselves \" \n Characteristics of collaborative leaders \n There have been a number of research projects and reviews of key lessons for collaborative leaders \n Nick Lovegrove and Matthew Thomas writing for the \n Harvard Business Review \n interviewed over leaders who have demonstrated their ability to engage and collaborate across the business government and social sectors and found six distinguishing characteristics \n Balanced motivations A desire to create public value no matter where they work combining their motivations to wield influence often in government have social impact often in nonprofits and generate wealth often in business \n Transferable skills A set of distinctive skills valued across sectors such as quantitative analytics strategic planning and stakeholder management \n Contextual intelligence A deep empathy of the differences within and between sectors especially those of language culture and key performance indicators \n Integrated networks A set of relationships across sectors to draw on when advancing their careers building top teams or convening decision-makers on a particular issue \n Prepared mind A willingness to pursue an unconventional career that zigzags across sectors and the financial readiness to take potential pay cuts from time to time \n Intellectual thread Holistic subject matter expertise on a particular intersector issue by understanding it from the perspective of each sector \n Madeleine Carter \n writing for the \n Center for Effective Public Policy \n as part of research project funded by the \n United States Department of Justice \n and \n State Justice Institute \n defines five qualities of a collaborative leader \n citation needed \n Willingness to take risks \n Eager listeners \n Passion for the cause \n Optimistic about the future \n Able to share knowledge power and credit \n Archer and Cameron list ten key lessons for a successful collaborative leader \n Find the \n personal \n motive for collaborating \n Find ways of simplifying complex situations for your people \n Prepare for how you are going to handle conflict well in advance \n Recognize that there are some people or organisations you just can't partner with \n Have the courage to act for the long term \n Actively manage the tension between focusing on delivery and on building relationships \n Invest in strong personal relationships at all levels \n Inject energy passion and drive into your leadership style \n Have the confidence to share the credit generously \n Continually develop your interpersonal skills in particular empathy patience tenacity holding difficult conversations and coalition building \n Rod Newing writing in a \n Financial Times \n supplement special report says \"If a collaboration is to be effective each party must recognise and respect the different culture of the other\" And traditional development paths don't prepare leaders well for this \"traditional management development is based on giving potential managers a team of people and a set of resources to control and success is rewarded with more people and more resources to control By contrast collaboration requires managers to achieve success through people and resources outside their control and for this they have had no preparation\" \n citation needed \n Steven Wilson mentions in Collaborative leadership its good to talk four major key leadership traits that all highly collaborative leaders share They \n Focus on authentic leadership placing the goals of the organization ahead of their own self-interest and following through on their commitments \n Relentlessly pursue transparent decision making clear how their decisions are made and who is accountable for the outcomes \n View resources as instruments of action realizing shared goals through the flexible use of shared resources \n Clarify the relationship between decisions rights accountability and rewards taking time to establish decision paths and a common vocabulary that everyone can comprehend for successful collaborations \n Chantale Mailhot Stephanie Gagnon Anne Langley and Louis-Felix Binitte did a research project to examine the qualities of distributing leadership and the effects diversity has on groups They found that \"coupling of leaders and objects helped to maintain the worldview of the different groups involved at different levels in the research project while directing them towards project objectives\" \n In retrospect the differences of each individual increases innovation due to the variety of minds at work With everyone having their own qualities and prior experiences the integration between them in a leadership role contributes to the overall experience In this study the case was made that collaborative leadership has many benefits and is more practical than just one person solely having the role as the leader \n The best thing a collaborative leader can do is to lead by example They have to walk the talk and be seen to model the right behaviors Leaders must show a willingness take risks continually question their own ideas and reward others for their clear communication and valuable insights \n Applications \n The need for collaborative leadership is being recognised in more and more areas \n Public Private Partnerships \n Global \n Supply Chains \n Civic collaboration to solve complex community problems \n On-line collaboration \n Linux \n Wikipedia \n etc \n Political collaboration to tackle global issues such as the \n credit crunch \n climate change \n and terrorism \n The Government- According to Heather Getha-Taylor and Ricardo S Morse as part of their article collaborative leadership has an impact on the roles of local government officials It is said that public administration is shifting to a more collaborative leadership oriented field because it helps with the set of skills necessary for the jobs \n Education- According to Abdolhamid Arbabi and Vali Mehdinezhad collaborative leadership adds to cooperation which allows for adaptability and consistency It increases organizational commitment and decreases employee resistance to changes There is a significant correlation between the teachers self-efficiency and the principles style of collaborative leadership According to Gialamas Pelonis and Medeiros collaborative leadership allows for leaders to work together It allows for a better adaptability to change which in turn allows for growth and development \n Health Services- According to Markle-Reid Dykeman Ploeg Stradiotto Andrews Bonomo & Stradiotto collaborative leadership in the Health area will allow for a more widespread set of skills required to help the patients An example brought up is the idea that the elderly do not receive the help they require because of the fact that the people do not know how to react in the given case They know what to do but when confronted by the situation they do not know how to act Collaborative leadership will allow for the skills necessary as well as a uniform set of actions they must follow \n An \n Ipsos MORI \n research report published in found that relationship management and collaborative leadership were the top two qualities or capabilities that Directors of organisations involved in large business partnerships would have liked to have had more access to when setting up

The Reflection step is a pause in our activities where we gather data impressions history stories and any other observations about what we have done In order to do this effectively we must develop and exercise the capacity for Detachment detachment from preconceived notions \n Learning - In the Learning step we carefully examine the observations made in the Reflection step and \"discover\" new insights skills relationships structures failures or any other conceptual changes We search for the principles involved in our work In order to do this effectively we must develop and exercise the capacity of Search search for the underlying principles \n Planning - In the Planning Step we apply the conceptual understandings we have developed We use these newly discovered principles to systematically to create a plan of action We should directly reflect in our planning each insight or principle we have learned In order to do this step effectively we must develop and exercise the capacity for Love love for the act of learning \n Action - In the Action Step as an individual team or organization we carry out the plans we have created We do our work In order to do this effectively we must have Courage courage to plunge into the unknown \n The Four Capacities \n Each of the four capacities in the Learning Circle are prerequisites for taking the next step At the same time as we exercise these capacities through the use of the Learning Circle we develop these capacities within ourselves in our teams and in our organizations Our inner conditions and capabilities have an effect on our environment which in turn then has an effect on us By going through the Learning Circle we use and develop these four capacities \n Detachment- The capacity for Detachment supports the Reflection step Detachment is openness Detachment means that we set aside our ego and objectively look at the evidence including facts events and feelings \n Search- The capacity for Search supports the Learning step Search includes consultation wisdom discernment judgement and search for solutions \n Love of the Work - The capacity for Love of the learning supports the Planning step Love creates openness to Guidance Love engenders vision passion and a sense of purpose \n Courage -The capacity for Courage supports the Action step Courage encompasses conscious choice volition willingness and desire to act even in the face of uncertainty \n Guidance - Central to the effectiveness of the Learning Circle is Guidance \n Guidance is the act of assisting an individual team or organization to reach a destination by accompanying giving directions or supplying with them advice Guidance plays a pivotal role in developing our capacity and can be applied to all four steps and all four capacities For individuals teams and organizations Guidance is critical to be able to progress in the development of knowledge skills or capacities Guidance can come from within - a team member who has expertise can share it with the other team members And Guidance can come from outside - we can bring experts into the organization we can read books or web sites Inspiration can also be thought of as a form of Guidance for example a team member suddenly has a bright idea Being open to receiving Guidance ensures that the Learning Circle is both organic and disciplined \n Model Distributed Leadership and Collaboration in Online Learning Circles \n In this model Learning circles are described as a structure or distributed leadership in collaborative learning contexts Riel \n \"A learning circle is a highly interactive participatory structure for organizing group work The goal is to build share and express knowledge though a process of open dialogue and deep reflection around issues or problems with a focus on a shared outcome \" \n This model is described by a set of defining dimensions norms that support the interaction and the phase structure that guides the process Many of these features also describe learning circles in face to face settings \n Learning Circle Model of Distributed Leadership and Cognition -

has various rights to use associated with it and may also have various properties of how it was designed e g open process There is no single definition and interpretations vary with usage \n The terms \n open \n and \n standard \n have a wide range of meanings associated with their usage There are a number of definitions of open standards which emphasize different aspects of openness including the openness of the resulting specification the openness of the drafting process and the ownership of rights in the standard The term \"standard\" is sometimes restricted to technologies approved by formalized committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate on a consensus basis \n The definitions of the term \n open standard \n used by academics the European Union and some of its member governments or parliaments such as Denmark France and Spain preclude open standards requiring fees for use as do the New Zealand South African and the Venezuelan governments On the standard organisation side the \n World Wide Web Consortium \n W3C ensures that its specifications can be implemented on a \n royalty-free \n basis \n Many definitions of the term \n standard \n permit patent holders to impose \"reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing\" royalty fees and other licensing terms on implementers or users of the standard For example the rules for standards published by the major internationally recognized standards bodies such as the \n Internet Engineering Task Force \n IETF \n International Organization for Standardization \n ISO \n International Electrotechnical Commission \n IEC and \n ITU-T \n permit their standards to contain specifications whose implementation will require payment of patent licensing fees Among these organizations only the IETF and ITU-T explicitly refer to their standards as \"open standards\" while the others refer only to producing \"standards\" The IETF and ITU-T use definitions of \"open standard\" that allow \n \"reasonable and non-discriminatory\" patent licensing \n fee requirements \n There are those in the open-source software community who hold that an \"open standard\" is only open if it can be freely adopted implemented and extended \n While open standards or architectures are considered non-proprietary in the sense that the standard is either unowned or owned by a collective body it can still be publicly shared and not tightly guarded \n The typical example of open source that has become a standard is the personal computer originated by IBM and now referred to as Wintel the combination of the Microsoft operating system and Intel microprocessor There are three others that are most widely accepted as open which include the GSM phones adopted as a government standard Open Group which promotes UNIX and the like and the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF which created the first standards of SMTP and TCP/IP Buyers tend to prefer open standards which they believe offer them cheaper products and more choice for access due to network effects and increased competition between vendors \n Open standards which specify formats are sometimes referred to as \n open formats \n Many specifications that are sometimes referred to as standards are proprietary and only available under restrictive contract terms if they can be obtained at all from the organization that owns the copyright on the specification As such these specifications are not considered to be fully \n open \n Joel West has argued that \"open\" standards are not black and white but have many different levels of \"openness\" Ultimately a standard needs \n according to whom? \n to be open enough that it will become adopted and accepted in the market but still closed enough that firms can get a return on their investment in developing the technology around the standard A more open standard tends to occur when the knowledge of the technology becomes dispersed enough that competition is increased and others are able to start copying the technology as they implement it This occurred with the Wintel architecture as others were able to start imitating the software Less open standards exist when a particular firm has much power not ownership over the standard which can occur when a firms platform wins in standard setting or the market makes one platform most popular \n Specific definitions of an open standard \n Joint IEEE ISOC W3C IETF and IAB Definition \n ITU-T definition \n IETF definition \n European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services \n Network Centric

Internet Society ISOC World Wide Web Consortium W3C Internet Engineering Task Force IETF and Internet Architecture Board IAB \n jointly affirmed \n a set of principles which have contributed to the exponential growth of the Internet and related technologies The \n OpenStand Principles \n define open standards and establish the building blocks for innovation Standards developed using the OpenStand principles are developed through an open participatory process support interoperability foster global competition are voluntarily adopted on a global level and serve as building blocks for products and services targeted to meet the needs of markets and consumers This drives innovation which in turn contributes to the creation of new markets and the growth and expansion of existing markets \n There are five key OpenStand Principles as outlined below \n Cooperation \n Respectful cooperation between standards organizations whereby each respects the autonomy integrity processes and intellectual property rules of the others \n Adherence to Principles \n Adherence to the five fundamental principles of standards development \n Due process \n Decisions are made with equity and fairness among participants No one party dominates or guides standards development Standards processes are transparent and opportunities exist to appeal decisions Processes for periodic standards review and updating are well defined \n Broad consensus \n Processes allow for all views to be considered and addressed such that agreement can be found across a range of interests \n Transparency \n Standards organizations provide advance public notice of proposed standards development activities the scope of work to be undertaken and conditions for participation Easily accessible records of decisions and the materials used in reaching those decisions are provided Public comment periods are provided before final standards approval and adoption \n Balance \n Standards activities are not exclusively dominated by any particular person company or interest group \n Openness \n Standards processes are open to all interested and informed parties \n Collective Empowerment \n Commitment by affirming standards organizations and their participants to collective empowerment by striving for standards that \n are chosen and defined based on technical merit as judged by the contributed expertise of each participant \n provide global interoperability scalability stability and resiliency \n enable global competition \n serve as building blocks for further innovation and \n contribute to the creation of global communities benefiting humanity \n Availability \n Standards specifications are made accessible to all for implementation and deployment Affirming standards organizations have defined procedures to develop specifications that can be implemented under fair terms Given market diversity fair terms may vary from royalty-free to fair reasonable and non-discriminatory terms FRAND \n Voluntary Adoption \n Standards are voluntarily adopted and success is determined by the market \n ITU-T definition \n The \n ITU-T \n is a \n standards development organization \n SDO that is one of the three sectors of the \n International Telecommunications Union \n a specialized agency of the \n United Nations \n The ITU-T has a Telecommunication Standardization Bureau director's \n Ad Hoc \n group on IPR that produced the following definition in March which the ITU-T as a whole has endorsed for its purposes since November \n The \n ITU-T \n has a long history of open standards development However recently some different external sources have attempted to define the term \"Open Standard\" in a variety of different ways In order to avoid confusion the ITU-T uses for its purpose the term \"Open Standards\" per the following definition \n \"Open Standards\" are standards made available to the general public and are developed or approved and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process \"Open Standards\" facilitate \n interoperability \n and data exchange among different products or services and are intended for widespread adoption \n Other elements of \"Open Standards\" include but are not limited to \n Collaborative process voluntary and market driven development or approval following a transparent consensus driven process that is reasonably open to all interested parties \n Reasonably balanced ensures that the process is not dominated by any one interest group \n Due process - includes consideration of and response to comments by interested parties \n Intellectual property rights IPRs IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide non-discriminatory basis either for free and under other reasonable terms and conditions or on reasonable terms and conditions which may include monetary compensation Negotiations are left to the parties concerned and are performed outside the \n SDO \n Quality and level of detail sufficient to permit the development of a variety of competing implementations of interoperable products or services Standardized interfaces are not hidden or controlled other than by the SDO promulgating the standard \n Publicly available easily available for implementation and use at a reasonable price Publication of the text of a standard by others is permitted only with the prior approval of the SDO \n On-going support maintained and supported over a long period of time \n The \n ITU-T \n ITU-R \n ISO \n and \n IEC \n have harmonized on a common patent policy \n under the banner of the \n WSC \n However the ITU-T definition should not necessarily be considered also applicable in ITU-R ISO and IEC contexts since the Common Patent Policy \n does not make any reference to \"open standards\" but rather only to \"standards \" \n IETF definition \n In section of its \n RFC \n the \n IETF \n classifies specifications that have been developed in a manner similar to that of the IETF itself as being \"open standards \" and lists the standards produced by \n ANSI \n ISO \n IEEE \n and \n ITU-T \n as examples As the IETF standardization processes and IPR policies have the characteristics listed above by ITU-T the IETF standards fulfill the ITU-T definition of \"open standards \" \n However the IETF has not adopted a specific definition of \"open standard\" both \n RFC \n and the IETF's mission statement \n RFC \n talks about \"open process \" but \n RFC \n does not define \"open standard\" except for the purpose of defining what documents IETF standards can link to \n RFC \n belongs to a set of RFCs collectively known as BCP Best Common Practice an IETF policy \n RFC \n was later updated by BCP and among others As of BCP is \n RFC \n Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust \n and BCP consists of \n RFC \n Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology and a clarification in \n RFC \n The changes are intended to be compatible with the \"Simplified \n BSD \n License\" as stated in the IETF Trust Legal Provisions and Copyright FAQ based on \n RFC \n In August the IETF combined with the W3C and \n IEEE \n to launch OpenStand \n and to publish The Modern Paradigm for Standards This captures \"the effective and efficient standardization processes that have made the Internet and Web the premiere platforms for innovation and borderless commerce\" The declaration is then published in the form of \n RFC \n in January \n European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services \n The \n European Union \n defined the term for use within its European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services Version \n although it does not claim to be a universal definition for all \n European Union \n use and documentation \n To reach interoperability in the context of pan-European eGovernment services guidance needs to focus on open standards \n The word \"open\" is here meant in the sense of fulfilling the following requirements \n The standard is adopted and will be maintained by a not-for-profit organization and its ongoing development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure available to all interested parties consensus or majority decision etc \n The standard has been published and the standard specification document is available either freely or at a nominal charge It must be permissible to all to copy distribute and use it for no fee or at a nominal fee \n The intellectual property - i e patents possibly present - of parts of the standard is made irrevocably available on a \n royalty-free \n basis \n There are no constraints on the re-use of the standard \n Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium definition \n The \n Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium \n NCOIC defines open standard as the following \n Specifications for hardware and/or software that are publicly available implying that multiple vendors can compete directly based on the features and performance of their products It also implies that the existing open system can be removed and replaced with that of another vendor with minimal effort and without major interruption \n Danish government definition \n The Danish government has attempted to make a definition of open standards \n which also is used in pan-European software development projects It states \n An open standard is accessible to everyone free of charge i e there is no discrimination between users and no payment or other considerations are required as a condition of use of the standard \n An open standard of necessity remains accessible and free of charge i e owners renounce their options if indeed such exist to limit access to the standard at a later date for example by committing themselves to openness during the remainder of a possible patent's life \n An open standard is accessible free of charge and documented in all its details i e all aspects of the standard are transparent and documented and both access to and use of the documentation is free \n French law definition \n The French Parliament approved a definition of \"open standard\" in its \"Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy \" \n The definition is \n By open standard is understood any communication interconnection or interchange protocol and any interoperable data format whose specifications are public and without any restriction in their access or implementation \n Indian Government Definition \n A clear Royalty Free stance and far reaching requirements case is the one for India's Government \n Mandatory Characteristics \n An Identified Standard will qualify as an Open Standard if it meets the following criteria \n Specification document of the Identified Standard shall be available with or without a nominal fee \n The Patent claims necessary to implement the Identified Standard shall be made available on a Royalty-Free basis for the life time of the Standard \n Identified Standard shall be adopted and maintained by a not-for-profit organization wherein all stakeholders can opt to participate in a transparent collaborative and consensual manner \n Identified Standard shall be recursively open as far as possible \n Identified Standard shall have technology-neutral specification \n Identified Standard shall be capable of localization support where applicable for all Indian official Languages for all applicable domains \n Italian Law definition \n Italy has a general rule for the entire public sector dealing with Open Standards although concentrating on data formats in Art of the Code of the Digital Administration \n Codice dell'Amministrazione Digitale \n applications must allow representation of data under different formats at least one being an open data format \n it is defined an open data format a data format which is made public is thoroughly documented and neutral with regard to the technological tools needed to peruse the same data \n Spanish law definition \n A Law passed by the Spanish Parliament \n requires that all electronic services provided by the Spanish public administration must be based on open standards It defines an open standard as royalty free according to the following definition \n An open standard fulfills the following conditions \n it is public and its use is available on a free gratis basis or at a cost that does not imply a difficulty for the user \n its use is not subject to the payment of any intellectual copyright or industrial patents and trademarks property right \n Venezuelan law definition \n The Venezuelan Government approved a \"free software and open standards law \" \n The decree includes the requirement that the Venezuelan public sector must use free software based on open standards and includes a definition of open standard \n Article for the purposes of this Decree it shall be understood as \n k Open standards technical specifications published and controlled by an organization in charge of their development that have been accepted by the industry available to everybody for their implementation in free software or other type of software promoting competitivity interoperability and flexibility \n South African Government definition \n The South African Government approved a definition in the \"Minimum Interoperability Operating Standards Handbook\" MIOS \n For the purposes of the MIOS a standard shall be considered open if it meets all of these criteria There are standards which we are obliged to adopt for pragmatic reasons which do not necessarily fully conform to being open in all respects In such cases where an open standard does not yet exist the degree of openness will be taken into account when selecting an appropriate standard \n it should be maintained by a non-commercial organization \n participation in the ongoing development work is based on decision making processes that are open to all interested parties \n open access all may access committee documents drafts and completed standards free of cost or for a negligible fee \n It must be possible for everyone to copy distribute and use the standard free of cost \n The intellectual rights required to implement the standard e g essential patent claims are irrevocably available without any royalties attached \n There are no reservations regarding reuse of the standard \n There are multiple implementations of the standard \n New Zealand official interoperability framework definition \n The E-Government Interoperability Framework e-GIF \n defines open standard as royalty free according to the following text \n While a universally agreed definition of \"open standards\" is unlikely to be resolved in the near future the e-GIF accepts that a definition of open standards needs to recognise a continuum that ranges from closed to open and encompasses varying degrees of \"openness \" To guide readers in this respect the e-GIF endorses \"open standards\" that exhibit the following properties \n Be accessible to everyone free of charge no discrimination between users and no payment or other considerations should be required as a condition to use the standard \n Remain accessible to everyone free of charge owners should renounce their options if any to limit access to the standard at a later date \n Be documented in all its details all aspects of the standard should be transparent and documented and both access to and use of the documentation should be free \n The e-GIF performs the same function in e-government as the Road Code does on the highways Driving would be excessively costly inefficient and ineffective if road rules had to be agreed each time one vehicle encountered another \n Bruce Perens' definition \n One of the most popular definitions of the term \"open standard \" as measured by Google ranking is the one developed by \n Bruce Perens \n His \n definition \n lists a set of principles that he believes must be met by an open standard \n Availability Open Standards are available for all to read and implement \n Maximize End-User Choice Open Standards create a fair competitive market for implementations of the standard They do not lock the customer into a particular vendor or group \n No Royalty Open Standards are free for all to \n implement \n with no royalty or fee \n Certification \n of compliance by the standards organization may involve a fee \n No Discrimination Open Standards and the organizations that administer them do not favor one implementor over another for any reason other than the technical standards compliance of a vendors implementation Certification organizations must provide a path for low and zero-cost implementations to be validated but may also provide enhanced certification services \n Extension or Subset Implementations of Open Standards may be extended or offered in subset form However certification organizations may decline to certify subset implementations and may place requirements upon extensions see \n Predatory Practices \n Predatory Practices Open Standards may employ license terms that protect against subversion of the standard by \n embrace-and-extend \n tactics The licenses attached to the standard may require the publication of reference information for extensions and a license for all others to create distribute and sell software that is compatible with the extensions An Open Standard may not otherwise prohibit extensions \n Microsoft's definition \n Vijay Kapoor national technology officer \n Microsoft \n defines what open standards are as follows \n Let's look at what an open standard means 'open' refers to it being royalty-free while 'standard' means a technology approved by formalized committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate on a consensus basis An open standard is publicly available and developed approved and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process \n Overall Microsoft's relationship to open standards is at best mixed While Microsoft participates in the most significant standard-setting organizations that establish open standards it is often seen as oppositional to their adoption \n The model started to shift however in and since the XML standard Microsoft has been earning a better reputation within the open-source and open-standards community \n Open Source Initiative's definition \n The \n Open Source Initiative \n defines the requirements and criteria for open standards as follows \n The Requirement \n An \"open standard\" must not prohibit conforming implementations in open source software \n The Criteria \n To comply with the Open Standards Requirement an \"open standard\" must satisfy the following criteria If an \"open standard\" does not meet these criteria it will be discriminating against open source developers \n No Intentional Secrets The standard MUST NOT withhold any detail necessary for interoperable implementation As flaws are inevitable the standard MUST define a process for fixing flaws identified during implementation and interoperability testing and to incorporate said changes into a revised version or superseding version of the standard to be released under terms that do not violate the OSR \n Availability The standard MUST be freely and publicly available e g from a stable web site under royalty-free terms at reasonable and non-discriminatory cost \n Patents All patents essential to implementation of the standard MUST \n be licensed under royalty-free terms for unrestricted use or \n be covered by a promise of non-assertion when practiced by open source software \n No Agreements There MUST NOT be any requirement for execution of a license agreement NDA grant click-through or any other form of paperwork to deploy conforming implementations of the standard \n No OSR-Incompatible Dependencies Implementation of the standard MUST NOT require any other technology that fails to meet the criteria of this Requirement \n Ken Krechmer's definition \n Ken Krechmer \n identifies ten \"rights\" \n Open Meeting \n Consensus \n Due Process \n Open IPR \n One World \n Open Change \n Open Documents \n Open Interface \n Open Use \n On-going Support \n World Wide Web Consortium's definition \n As an important provider of Web technology \n ICT \n Standards notably \n XML \n http \n HTML \n CSS \n and \n WAI \n the \n World Wide Web Consortium \n W3C follows a process that promotes the development of high-quality standards \n Looking at the end result the spec alone up for adoption is not enough The participative/inclusive process leading to a particular design and the supporting resources available with it should be accounted when we talk about Open Standards \n transparency due process is public and all technical discussions meeting minutes are archived and referencable in decision making \n relevance new standardization is started upon due analysis of the market needs including requirements phase e g accessibility multi-linguism \n openness anybody can participate and everybody does industry individual public government bodies academia on a worldwide scale \n impartiality and consensus guaranteed fairness by the process and the neutral hosting of the W3C organization with equal weight for each participant \n availability free access to the standard text both during development at final stage and for translations and assurance that core Web and Internet technologies can be implemented Royalty-Free \n maintenance ongoing process for testing errata revision permanent access validation etc \n In August the W3C combined with the IETF and IEEE to launch OpenStand \n and to publish The Modern Paradigm for Standards This captures \"the effective and efficient standardization processes that have made the Internet and Web the premiere platforms for innovation and borderless commerce\" \n Digital Standards Organization definition \n The \n Digital Standards Organization \n DIGISTAN states that \"an open standard must be aimed at creating unrestricted competition between vendors and unrestricted choice for users \" \n Its brief definition of \"open standard\" or \"free and open standard\" is \"a published specification that is immune to vendor capture at all stages in its life-cycle \" Its more complete definition as follows \n \"The standard is adopted and will be maintained by a not-for-profit organization and its ongoing development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure available to all interested parties \n The standard has been published and the standard specification document is available freely It must be permissible to all to copy distribute and use it freely \n The patents possibly present on parts of the standard are made irrevocably available on a royalty-free basis \n There are no constraints on the re-use of the standard \n A key defining property is that an open standard is immune to vendor capture at all stages in its life-cycle Immunity from vendor capture makes it possible to improve upon trust and extend an open standard over time \" \n This definition is based on the EU's EIF v1 definition of \"open standard \" but with changes to address what it terms as \"vendor capture \" They believe that \"Many groups and individuals have provided definitions for 'open standard' that reflect their economic interests in the standards process We see that the fundamental conflict is between vendors who seek to capture markets and raise costs and the market at large which seeks freedom and lower costs Vendors work hard to turn open standards into franchise standards They work to change the statutory language so they can cloak franchise standards in the sheep's clothing of 'open standard ' A robust definition of \"free and open standard\" must thus take into account the direct economic conflict between vendors and the market at large \" \n Free Software Foundation Europe's definition \n The \n Free Software Foundation Europe \n FSFE uses a \n definition \n which is based on the \n European Interoperability Framework \n v and was extended after consultation with industry and community stakeholders FSFE's standard has been adopted by groups such as the \n SELF \n EU Project the Geneva Declaration on Standards and the Future of the Internet and international \n Document Freedom Day \n teams \n According to this definition an Open Standard is a format or protocol that is \n Subject to full public assessment and use without constraints in a manner equally available to all parties \n Without any components or extensions that have dependencies on formats or protocols that do not meet the definition of an Open Standard themselves \n Free from legal or technical clauses that limit its utilisation by any party or in any business model \n Managed and further developed independently of any single vendor in a process open to the equal participation of competitors and third parties \n Available in multiple complete implementations by competing vendors or as a complete implementation equally available to all parties \n FFII's definition \n The \n Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure \n 's definition is said \n by whom? \n to coincide with the definition issued in the European Interoperability Framework released in \n A specification that is public the standard is inclusive and it has been developed and is maintained in an open standardization process everybody can implement it without any restriction neither payment to license the IPR granted to everybody for free and without any condition This is the minimum license terms asked by standardization bodies as W3C Of course all the other bodies accept open standards But specification itself could cost a fair amount of money ie 100-400Eur per copy as in ISO because copyright and publication of the document itself \n UK government definition \n The UK government's definition of open standards applies to software interoperability data and document formats The criteria for open standards are published in the \n Open Standards Principles \n policy paper and are as follows \n Collaboration - the standard is maintained through a collaborative decision-making process that is consensus based and independent of any individual supplier Involvement in the development and maintenance of the standard is accessible to all interested parties \n Transparency - the decision-making process is transparent and a publicly accessible review by subject matter experts is part of the process \n Due process - the standard is adopted by a specification or standardisation organisation or a forum or consortium with a feedback and ratification process to ensure quality \n Fair access - the standard is published thoroughly documented and publicly available at zero or low cost Zero cost is preferred but this should be considered on a case by case basis as part of the selection process Cost should not be prohibitive or likely to cause a barrier to a level playing field \n Market support - other than in the context of creating innovative solutions the standard is mature supported by the market and demonstrates platform application and vendor independence \n Rights - rights essential to implementation of the standard and for interfacing with other implementations which have adopted that same standard are licensed on a royalty free basis that is compatible with both open source and proprietary licensed solutions These rights should be irrevocable unless there is a breach of licence conditions \n Comparison of definitions \n Publisher \n Time of publication \n Availability \n Usage rights \n Process \n Completeness \n The specification must be redistributable free of charge \n The specification must be redistributable under FRAND terms \n Essential patents must be made irrevocably available royalty free \n Essential patents must be licensable under FRAND terms \n Further development must be open for anyone toparticipate in \n Further development must be open for anyone to view \n Technologically mature standards must be implemented by \n multiple vendors or an open reference implementation \n Joint IEEE ISOC W3C IETF IAB \n 2012-08-12 \n No \n No \n No \n Red herring \n No \n No \n No \n ITU-T \n 2005-03 \n

and non-discriminatory \n RAND \n licensing \n for the use of patented technology in \n web standards \n increased \n Bruce Perens \n important associations as \n FSF \n or \n FFII \n and others have argued that the use of \n patents \n restricts who can implement a standard to those able or willing to pay for the use of the patented technology The \n requirement \n to pay some small amount per user is often an insurmountable problem for free/open source software implementations which can be redistributed by anyone \n Royalty free \n RF licensing is generally the only possible license for free/open source software implementations Version of the \n GNU General Public License \n includes a section that enjoins anyone who distributes a program released under the GPL from enforcing patents on subsequent users of the software or derivative works \n One result of this controversy was that many governments including the Danish French and Spanish governments singly and the EU collectively specifically affirmed that \"open standards\" required royalty-free licenses Some standards organizations such as the \n W3C \n modified their processes to essentially only permit royalty-free licensing \n Patents for \n software formulas and algorithms \n are currently enforceable in the US but not in the EU The \n European Patent Convention Article paragraph c \n expressly prohibits algorithms business methods and software from being covered by patents The US has only allowed them since and there has been growing controversy in recent years as to either the benefit or feasibility \n A standards body and its associated processes cannot \n force \n a patent holder to give up its right to charge license fees especially if the company concerned is not a member of the standards body and unconstrained by any rules that were set during the standards development process In fact this element discourages some standards bodies from adopting an \"open\" approach fearing that they will lose out if their members are more constrained than non-members Few bodies will carry out or require their members to carry out a full patent search Ultimately the only sanctions a standards body can apply on a non-member when patent licensing is demanded is to cancel the standard try to rework around it or work to invalidate the patent Standards bodies such as W3C and OASIS require \n citation needed \n that the use of required patents be granted under a royalty-free license as a condition for joining the body or a particular working group and this is generally considered enforceable \n citation needed \n Examples of patent claims brought against standards previously thought to be open include \n JPEG \n and the \n Rambus \n case over \n DDR SDRAM \n The \n H video codec \n is an example of a standards organization producing a standard that has known non-royalty-free required patents \n Often the scope of the standard itself determines how likely it is that a firm will be able to use a standard as patent-like protection Richard Langlois argues that standards with a wide scope may offer a firm some level of protection from competitors but it is likely that

software \n End of 1990s Foundation of the Open Source Initiative \n In the early days of computing programmers and developers shared software in order to learn from each other and evolve the field of computing Eventually the open source notion moved to the way side of commercialization of software in the years 1970-1980 In \n Eric Raymond \n published \n The Cathedral and the Bazaar \n a reflective analysis of the hacker community and free software principles The paper received significant attention in early and was one factor in motivating \n Netscape Communications Corporation \n to release their popular \n Netscape Communicator \n Internet suite as \n free software \n This source code subsequently became the basis behind \n SeaMonkey \n Mozilla Firefox \n Thunderbird \n and \n KompoZer \n Netscape's act prompted Raymond and others to look into how to bring the \n Free Software Foundation \n 's free software ideas and perceived benefits to the commercial software industry They concluded that FSF's social activism was not appealing to companies like Netscape and looked for a way to rebrand the \n free software movement \n to emphasize the business potential of sharing and collaborating on software source code \n The new term they chose was \"open source\" which was soon adopted by \n Bruce Perens \n publisher \n Tim O'Reilly \n Linus Torvalds \n and others The \n Open Source Initiative \n was founded in February to encourage use of the new term and evangelize open-source principles \n While the Open Source Initiative sought to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize the principles it adhered to commercial software vendors found themselves increasingly threatened by the concept of freely distributed software and universal access to an application's \n source code \n A \n Microsoft \n executive publicly stated in that \"open source is an intellectual property destroyer I can't imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual-property business \" \n However while FOSS has historically played a role outside of the mainstream of private software development companies as large as \n Microsoft \n have begun to develop official open-source presences on the Internet IBM Oracle Google and State Farm are just a few of the companies with a serious public stake in today's competitive \n open-source \n market There has been a significant shift in the corporate philosophy concerning the development of FOSS \n The \n free software movement \n was launched in In a group of individuals advocated that the term free software should be replaced by open-source software OSS as an expression which is less ambiguous \n and more comfortable for the corporate world \n Software developers may want to publish their software with an \n open-source license \n so that anybody may also develop the same software or understand its internal functioning With open-source software generally anyone is allowed to create modifications of it port it to new operating systems and \n instruction set architectures \n share it with others or in some cases market it Scholars Casson and Ryan have pointed out several policy-based reasons for adoption of open source in particular the heightened value proposition from open source when compared to most proprietary formats in the following categories \n Security \n Affordability \n Transparency \n Perpetuity \n Interoperability \n Flexibility \n Localizationparticularly in the context of local governments who make software decisions Casson and Ryan argue that \"governments have an inherent responsibility and fiduciary duty to taxpayers\" which includes the careful analysis of these factors when deciding to purchase proprietary software or implement an open-source option \n The \n Open Source Definition \n notably presents an open-source philosophy and further defines the terms of use modification and redistribution of open-source software Software licenses grant rights to users which would otherwise be reserved by copyright law to the copyright holder Several open-source software licenses have qualified within the boundaries of the \n Open Source Definition \n The most prominent and popular example is the \n GNU General Public License \n GPL which \"allows free distribution under the condition that further developments and applications are put under the same licence\" thus also free \n The \n open source \n label came out of a strategy session held on April in \n Palo Alto \n in reaction to \n Netscape's \n January announcement of a source code release for \n Navigator \n as \n Mozilla \n A group of individuals at the session included \n Tim O'Reilly \n Linus Torvalds \n Tom Paquin \n Jamie Zawinski \n Larry Wall \n Brian Behlendorf \n Sameer Parekh \n Eric Allman \n Greg Olson \n Paul Vixie \n John Ousterhout \n Guido van Rossum \n Philip Zimmermann \n John Gilmore \n and \n Eric S Raymond \n They used the opportunity before the release of Navigator's source code to clarify a potential confusion caused by the ambiguity of the word \"free\" in \n English \n Many people claimed that the birth of the \n Internet \n since started the open source movement while others do not distinguish between open-source and free software movements \n The \n Free Software Foundation \n FSF started in intended the word \"free\" to mean \n freedom to distribute \n or \"free as in free speech\" and not \n freedom from cost \n or \"free as in free beer\" Since a great deal of free software already was and still is free of charge such free software became associated with zero cost which seemed anti-commercial \n The \n Open Source Initiative \n OSI was formed in February by Eric Raymond and Bruce Perens With at least years of evidence from case histories of closed software development versus open development already provided by the Internet developer community the OSI presented the \"open source\" case to commercial businesses like Netscape The OSI hoped that the use of the label \"open source\" a term suggested by Peterson of the \n Foresight Institute \n at the strategy session would eliminate ambiguity particularly for individuals who perceive \"free software\" as anti-commercial They sought to bring a higher profile to the practical benefits of freely available source code and they wanted to bring major software businesses and other high-tech industries into open source Perens attempted to register \"open source\" as a \n service mark \n for the OSI but that attempt was impractical by \n trademark \n standards Meanwhile due to the presentation of Raymond's paper to the upper management at NetscapeRaymond only discovered when he read the \n Press Release \n and was called by \n Netscape \n CEO \n Jim Barksdale \n 's PA later in the dayNetscape released its Navigator source code as open source with favorable results \n Definitions \n The logo of the \n Open Source Initiative \n The \n Open Source Initiative \n 's OSI definition is recognized by governments internationally \n as the standard or \n de facto \n definition In addition many of the world's largest open source software projects and contributors including Debian Drupal Association FreeBSD Foundation Linux Foundation Mozilla Foundation Wikimedia Foundation Wordpress Foundation have committed \n to upholding the OSI's mission and Open Source Definition through the OSI Affiliate Agreement \n OSI uses \n The Open Source Definition \n to determine whether it considers a software license open source The definition was based on the \n Debian Free Software Guidelines \n written and adapted primarily by Perens \n Perens did not base his writing on the \"four freedoms\" from the \n Free Software Foundation \n FSF which were only widely available later \n Under Perens' definition \n open source \n describes a broad general type of software license that makes source code available to the general public with relaxed or non-existent restrictions on the use and modification of the code It is an explicit \"feature\" of open source that it puts very few restrictions on the use or distribution by any organization or user in order to enable the rapid evolution of the software \n Despite initially accepting it \n Richard Stallman \n of the FSF now flatly opposes the term \"Open Source\" being applied to what they refer to as \"free software\" Although he agrees that the two terms describe \"almost the same category of software\" Stallman considers equating the terms incorrect and misleading \n Stallman also opposes the professed pragmatism of the \n Open Source Initiative \n as he fears that the free software ideals of freedom and community are threatened by compromising on the FSF's idealistic standards for software freedom \n The FSF considers free software to be a \n subset \n of open source software and Richard Stallman explained that \n DRM \n software for example can be developed as open source despite that it does not give its users freedom it restricts them and thus doesn't qualify as free software \n Open-source software licensing \n Open-source license \n Further information \n Free software license \n Free and open-source software Licensing \n and \n Software license \n When an author contributes code to an open-source project e g Apache org they do so under an explicit license e g the Apache Contributor License Agreement or an implicit license e g the open-source license under which the project is already licensing code Some open-source projects do not take contributed code under a license but actually require joint assignment of the author's copyright in order to accept code contributions into the project \n Examples of \n free software license \n / open-source licenses include \n Apache License \n BSD license \n GNU General Public License \n GNU Lesser General Public License \n MIT License \n Eclipse Public License \n and \n Mozilla Public License \n The \n proliferation of open-source licenses \n is a negative aspect of the open-source movement because it is often difficult to understand the legal implications of the differences between licenses With more than open-source projects available and more than unique licenses the complexity of deciding how to manage open-source use within \"closed-source\" commercial enterprises has dramatically increased Some are home-grown while others are modeled after mainstream \n FOSS \n licenses such as Berkeley Software Distribution \"BSD\" Apache MIT-style Massachusetts Institute of Technology or GNU General Public License \"GPL\" In view of this open-source practitioners are starting to use classification schemes in which \n FOSS \n licenses are grouped typically based on the existence and obligations imposed by the \n copyleft \n provision the strength of the copyleft provision \n An important legal milestone for the open source / free software movement was passed in when the US federal appeals court ruled that \n free software licenses \n definitely do set legally binding conditions on the use of copyrighted work and they are therefore enforceable under existing copyright law As a result if end-users violate the licensing conditions their license disappears meaning they are infringing copyright \n Despite this licensing risk most commercial software vendors are using open source software in commercial products while fulfilling the license terms e g leveraging the Apache license \n Certifications \n Certification can help to build user confidence Certification could be applied to the simplest component to a whole software system The \n United Nations University International Institute for Software Technology \n initiated a project known as \"The Global Desktop Project\" This project aims to build a desktop interface that every end-user is able to understand and interact with thus crossing the language and cultural barriers The project would improve developing nations' access to information systems UNU/IIST hopes to achieve this without any compromise in the quality of the software by introducing certifications \n Open-source software development \n Open-source software development model \n Development model \n In his essay \n The Cathedral and the Bazaar \n open-source evangelist \n Eric S Raymond \n suggests a model for developing OSS known as the \n bazaar \n model Raymond likens the development of software by traditional methodologies to building a cathedral \"carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation\" \n He suggests that all software should be developed using the bazaar style which he described as \"a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches \" \n In the traditional model of development which he called the \n cathedral \n model development takes place in a centralized way Roles are clearly defined Roles include people dedicated to designing the architects people responsible for managing the project and people responsible for implementation Traditional software engineering follows the cathedral model \n The bazaar model however is different In this model roles are not clearly defined Gregorio Robles \n suggests that software developed using the bazaar model should exhibit the following patterns \n Users should be treated as co-developers \n The users are treated like co-developers and so they should have access to the source code of the software Furthermore users are encouraged to submit additions to the software code fixes for the software \n bug reports \n documentation etc Having more co-developers increases the rate at which the software evolves \n Linus's law \n states \"Given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow \" This means that if many users view the source code they will eventually find all bugs and suggest how to fix them Note that some users have advanced programming skills and furthermore each user's machine provides an additional testing environment This new testing environment offers that ability to find and fix a new bug \n Early releases \n The first version of the software should be released as early as possible so as to increase one's chances of finding co-developers early \n Frequent integration \n Code changes should be integrated merged into a shared code base as often as possible so as to avoid the overhead of fixing a large number of bugs at the end of the project life cycle Some open source projects have nightly builds where \n integration is done automatically \n on a daily basis \n Several versions \n There should be at least two versions of the software There should be a buggier version with more features and a more stable version with fewer features The buggy version also called the development version is for users who want the immediate use of the latest features and are willing to accept the risk of using code that is not yet thoroughly tested The users can then act as co-developers reporting bugs and providing bug fixes \n High modularization \n The general structure of the software should be modular allowing for parallel development on independent components \n Dynamic decision making structure \n There is a need for a decision making structure whether formal or informal that makes strategic decisions depending on changing user requirements and other factors Cf \n Extreme programming \n Data suggests however that OSS is not quite as democratic as the bazaar model suggests An analysis of five billion bytes of free/open source code by developers shows that 74% of the code was written by the most active 10% of authors The average number of authors involved in a project was with the median at \n Advantages and disadvantages \n Open source software is usually easier to obtain than proprietary software often resulting in increased use Additionally the availability of an open source implementation of a standard can increase adoption of that standard \n It has also helped to build developer loyalty as developers feel empowered and have a sense of ownership of the end product \n Moreover lower costs of marketing and logistical services are needed for OSS OSS also helps companies keep abreast of technology developments It is a good tool to promote a company's image including its commercial products \n The OSS development approach has helped produce reliable high quality software quickly and inexpensively \n Open source development offers the potential for a more flexible technology and quicker innovation It is said to be more reliable since it typically has thousands of independent programmers testing and fixing bugs of the software It is flexible because modular systems allow programmers to build custom interfaces or add new abilities to it and it is innovative since open source programs are the product of collaboration among a large number of different programmers The mix of divergent perspectives corporate objectives and personal goals speeds up innovation \n Moreover free software can be developed in accord with purely technical requirements It does not require thinking about commercial pressure that often degrades the quality of the software Commercial pressures make traditional software developers pay more attention to customers' requirements than to security requirements since such features are somewhat invisible to the customer \n It is sometimes said that the open source development process may not be well defined and the stages in the development process such as system testing and documentation may be ignored However this is only true for small mostly single programmer projects Larger successful projects do define and enforce at least some rules as they need them to make the teamwork possible \n In the most complex projects these rules may be as strict as reviewing even minor change by two independent developers \n Not all OSS initiatives have been successful for example SourceXchange and \n Eazel \n Software experts and researchers who are not convinced by open source's ability to produce quality systems identify the unclear process the late defect discovery and the lack of any empirical evidence as the most important problems collected data concerning productivity and quality \n It is also difficult to design a commercially sound business model around the open source paradigm Consequently only technical requirements may be satisfied and not the ones of the market \n In terms of security open source may allow hackers to know about the weaknesses or loopholes of the software more easily than closed-source software It depends on control mechanisms in order to create effective performance of autonomous agents who participate in virtual organizations \n Development tools \n In OSS development tools are used to support the development of the product and the development process itself \n Revision control \n systems such as \n Concurrent Versions System \n CVS and later \n Subversion \n SVN and \n Git \n are examples of tools often themselves open source help manage the source code files and the changes to those files for a software project \n The projects are frequently hosted and published on sites like \n Launchpad \n Bitbucket \n and \n GitHub \n Open source projects are often loosely organized with \"little formalised process modelling or support\" but utilities such as issue trackers are often used to organize open source software development \n Commonly used \n bugtrackers \n include \n Bugzilla \n and \n Redmine \n Tools such as \n mailing lists \n and \n IRC \n provide means of coordination among developers \n Centralized code hosting sites also have social features that allow developers to communicate \n Organizations \n Some of the \"more prominent organizations\" involved in OSS development include the \n Apache Software Foundation \n creators of the Apache web server the \n Linux Foundation \n a nonprofit which as of \n update \n employed Linus Torvalds the creator of the \n Linux operating system \n kernel \n the \n Eclipse Foundation \n home of the \n Eclipse \n software development platform the Debian Project creators of the influential \n Debian \n GNU/Linux distribution the \n Mozilla Foundation \n home of the Firefox web browser and \n OW2 \n European-born community developing open source middleware New organizations tend to have a more sophisticated governance model and their membership is often formed by legal entity members \n Open Source Software Institute \n is a membership-based non-profit c organization established in that promotes the development and implementation of open source software solutions within US Federal state and local government agencies OSSI's efforts have focused on promoting adoption of open source software programs and policies within Federal Government and Defense and Homeland Security communities \n Open Source for America \n is a group created to raise awareness in the United States Federal Government about the benefits of open source software Their stated goals are to encourage the government's use of open source software participation in open source software projects and incorporation of open source community dynamics to increase government transparency \n Mil-OSS \n is a group dedicated to the advancement of OSS use and creation in the military \n Funding \n Business models for open-source software \n Open-source software \n is widely used both as independent applications and as components in non-open-source applications Many \n independent software vendors \n ISVs \n value-added resellers \n VARs and hardware \n vendors \n OEMs \n or \n ODMs \n use open-source \n frameworks \n modules and \n libraries \n inside their proprietary for-profit products and services \n From a customer's perspective the ability to use open technology under standard commercial terms and support is valuable They are willing to pay for the legal protection e g indemnification from copyright or patent infringement \"commercial-grade QA\" and professional support/training/consulting that are typical of commercial software while also receiving the benefits of fine-grained control and lack of lock-in that comes with open-source \n Comparisons with other software licensing/development models \n Closed source / proprietary software \n Comparison of open source and closed source \n The debate over \n open source \n vs \n closed source \n alternatively called \n proprietary software \n is sometimes heated \n The top four reasons as provided by Open Source Business Conference survey \n individuals or organizations choose open source software are \n lower cost \n security \n no vendor 'lock in' and \n better quality \n Since innovative companies no longer rely heavily on software sales proprietary software has become less of a necessity \n As such things like open source \n content management system \n or CMSdeployments are becoming more commonplace In \n the US White House switched its CMS system from a proprietary system to \n Drupal \n open source CMS Further companies like \n Novell \n who traditionally sold software the old-fashioned way continually debate the benefits of switching to open source availability having already switched part of the product offering to open source code \n In this way open source software provides solutions to unique or specific problems As such it is reported \n that 98% of enterprise-level companies use open source software offerings in some capacity \n With this market shift more critical systems are beginning to rely on open source offerings \n allowing greater funding such as \n US Department of Homeland Security \n grants \n to help \"hunt for security bugs \" According to a pilot study of organisations adopting or not adopting OSS several factors of statistical significance were observed in the manager's beliefs in relation to a attitudes toward outcomes b the influences and behaviours of others and c their ability to act \n Proprietary source distributors have started to develop and contribute to the open source community due to the market share shift doing so by the need to reinvent their models in order to remain competitive \n Many advocates argue that open source software is inherently safer because any person can view edit and change code \n A study of the Linux source code has bugs per lines of code while proprietary software generally scores bugs per lines \n Free software \n Alternative terms for free software \n Comparison of free and open-source software licenses \n According to the \n Free software movement \n 's leader \n Richard Stallman \n the main difference is that by choosing one term over the other i e either \"open source\" or \" \n free software \n \" one lets others know about what one's goals are \"Open source is a development methodology free software is a social movement \" \n Nevertheless there is significant overlap between open source software and free software \n The FSF \n said that the term \"open source\" fosters an ambiguity of a different kind such that it confuses the mere availability of the source with the freedom to use modify and redistribute it On the other hand the \"free software\" term was criticized for the ambiguity of the word \"free\" as \"available at no cost\" which was seen as discouraging for business adoption \n and for the historical ambiguous usage of the term \n Developers have used the \n alternative terms \n Free and Open Source Software \n FOSS \n or \n Free/Libre and Open Source Software \n FLOSS consequently to describe open source software that is also \n free software \n While the definition of open source software is very similar to the FSF's \n free software definition \n it was based on the \n Debian Free Software Guidelines \n written and adapted primarily by \n Bruce Perens \n with input from \n Eric S Raymond \n and others \n The term \"open source\" was originally intended to be trademarkable however the term was deemed too descriptive so no trademark exists \n The OSI would prefer that people treat open source as if it were a trademark and use it only to describe software licensed under an OSI approved license \n OSI Certified \n is a trademark licensed only to people who are distributing software licensed under a license listed on the Open Source Initiative's list \n Open-source versus source-available \n Although the OSI definition of \"open source software\" is widely accepted a small number of people and organizations use the term to refer to software where the source is available for viewing but which may not legally be modified or redistributed Such software is more often referred to as \n source-available \n or as \n shared source \n a term coined by Microsoft in \n While in two shared source licenses were certified by the \n OSI \n most of the shared source licenses are still \n source-available only \n In \n Michael Tiemann \n president of OSI had criticized \n companies such as \n SugarCRM \n for promoting their software as \"open source\" when in fact it did not have an OSI-approved license In SugarCRM's case it was because the software is so-called \" \n badgeware \n \" \n since it specified a \"badge\" that must be displayed in the user interface SugarCRM has since switched to \n GPLv3 \n Another example was \n Scilab \n prior to version which called itself \"the open source platform for numerical computation\" \n but had a license \n that forbade commercial redistribution of modified versions \n Open-sourcing \n Open-sourcing \n is the act of propagating the \n open source movement \n most often referring to releasing previously \n proprietary software \n under an \n open source \n / \n free software \n license \n but it may also refer programing Open Source software or installing Open Source software \n Notable software packages previously proprietary which have been open sourced include \n Netscape Navigator \n the code of which became the basis of the \n Mozilla \n and \n Mozilla Firefox \n web browsers \n StarOffice \n which became the base of the \n OpenOffice org \n office suite \n and \n LibreOffice \n Global File System \n was originally \n GPL'd \n then made proprietary in ? but in was re-GPL'd \n SAP DB \n which has become \n MaxDB \n and is now distributed and owned by \n MySQL AB \n InterBase \n database which was open sourced by \n Borland \n in and presently exists as a commercial product and an open-source fork \n Firebird \n Before changing the license of software distributors usually audit the source code for third party licensed code which they would have to remove or obtain permission for its relicense \n Backdoors \n and other \n malware \n should also be removed as they may easily be discovered after release of the code \n Current applications and adoption \n Free and open-source software Adoption \n Linux adoption \n and \n Free software Adoption \n \"We migrated key functions from Windows to Linux because we needed an operating system that was stable and reliable one that would give us in-house control So if we needed to patch adjust or adapt we could \" \n Official statement of the \n United Space Alliance \n which manages the computer systems for the \n International Space Station \n ISS regarding why they chose to switch from Windows to \n Debian GNU/Linux \n on the ISS \n Widely used open-source software \n List of free and open-source software packages \n Open source software projects are built and maintained by a network of volunteer programmers and are widely used in free as well as commercial products \n Prime examples of open-source products are the \n Apache HTTP Server \n the e-commerce platform \n osCommerce \n internet browsers \n Mozilla Firefox \n and \n Chromium \n the project where the vast majority of development of the freeware \n Google Chrome \n is done and the full office suite \n LibreOffice \n One of the most successful open-source products is the \n GNU/Linux \n operating system an open-source \n Unix-like \n operating system and its derivative \n Android \n an operating system for mobile devices \n In some industries open source software is the norm \n Extensions for non-software use \n Open source model \n Open content \n and \n Open collaboration \n While the term \"open source\" applied originally only to the source code of software \n it is now being applied to many other areas \n such as \n Open source ecology \n a movement to decentralize technologies so that any human can use them However it is often misapplied to other areas which have different and competing principles which overlap only partially \n The same principles that underlie open source software can be found in many other ventures such as \n open-source hardware \n Wikipedia \n and \n open-access \n publishing Collectively these principles are known as \n open source \n open content \n and \n open collaboration \n \"any system of innovation or production that relies on goal-oriented yet loosely coordinated participants who interact to create a product or service of economic value which they make available to contributors and non-contributors alike \" \n This \"culture\" or ideology takes the view that the principles apply more generally to facilitate concurrent input of different agendas approaches and priorities in contrast with more centralized models of development such as those typically used in commercial

to hear \n Richard Wagner \n 's \n Ring Cycle \n Gabriel Faur \n and \n Andr Messager \n wrote a piece for piano four-hands called \n Souvenir de Bayreuth \n subtitled \n Fantaisie en forme de quadrille sur les thmes favoris de L'Anneau Du Nibelung de Richard Wagner \n It was not published during their lifetimes and appeared in print only in \n Electroacoustic music \n Collaboration has been a constant feature of \n Electroacoustic music \n due to the complexity of the technology Since the beginning all laboratories and electronic music studios have involved the presence of different individuals with diverse but intertwined competencies In particular the embedding of technological tools into the process of musical creation resulted in the emergence of a new agent with new expertise the musical assistant the technician the tutor the computer music designer the music mediator a profession that has been described and defined in different ways over the years who can work in the phase of writing creating new instruments recording and/or performance \n He or she explains the possibilities of the various instruments and applications as well as the potential sound effects to the composer when the latter did not have sufficient knowledge of the programme or a clear idea of what he or she could obtain from it The musical assistant also explains the most recent results in musical research and translates artistic ideas into programming languages Finally he or she transforms those ideas into a score or a computer program and often performs the musical piece during the concerts \n Examples of collaboration are numerous \n Pierre Boulez \n and Andrew Gerzso Alvise Vidolin and \n Luigi Nono \n Jonathan Harvey \n and Gilbert Nouno among others Composers remain the sole authors of this music works whereas musical assistants are mentioned within the musical documentation scores press program notes as music assistants or computer music designers \n Other forms of musical collaboration \n Another case of note was that of \n Eric Fenby \n who worked as \n amanuensis \n for the blind \n Frederick Delius \n Delius would dictate the notes and Fenby would transcribe them While Fenby was himself a composer these works on which he and Delius worked together were a collaboration in terms of the labour involved in writing them down but not in terms of the musical ideas which were entirely Delius's own \n Film scores \n over the years have tended to be collaborative projects in various ways from the simple matter of \n orchestrators \n working with the sketches by the composer to multi-composer collaborative efforts Originally with the \n studio system \n composers often contributed parts of a score assigned by the head of the music department Sometimes this was music not specific to that film for lower budget movies In modern times collaboration is seen in such groups as \n Remote Control Productions \n True collaboration has also occurred with such varied examples as \n Bernard Herrmann \n and \n Alfred Newman \n who together composed the music for \n The Egyptian \n and \n Hans Zimmer \n and \n James Newton Howard \n who wrote the music for two Batman films \n Batman Begins \n and \n The Dark Knight \n Transformations \n Composer tributes classical music \n There are various cases where a later composer has transformed an existing work or group of works into a new form but this would generally be considered an arrangement by another hand rather than a collaboration Examples of this would include \n Franz Liszt \n 's many piano arrangements of symphonies and other works by composers such as \n Ludwig van Beethoven \n and \n Franz Schubert \n Liszt was the most prominent of a great number of composers who arranged the works of others for other combinations of instruments \n Charles Gounod \n took the harmonies from \n Johann Sebastian Bach \n 's Prelude No in C major from Book I of \n The Well-Tempered Clavier \n and added his own melodic line setting it to the words of the prayer \n Hail Mary \n in Latin \n Ave Maria \n His setting was called \n Ave Maria \n Edvard Grieg \n wrote additional piano parts for a number of solo piano \n sonatas \n by \n Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart \n to be played simultaneously with the original music on piano four-hands Mozart's original score was untouched The resultant work is certainly music by both Mozart and Grieg however they did not collaborate in the ordinary sense of the term Mozart having died years before Grieg was born \n Leopold Godowsky \n 's reworking of \n Frdric Chopin \n 's \n tudes \n by playing two tudes simultaneously or playing in the left hand the music originally written for the right hand and vice versa See \n Studies on Chopin's tudes \n Arthur Benjamin \n took a number of unrelated \n harpsichord \n sonatas by \n Domenico Cimarosa \n arranged them for \n oboe \n and orchestra and grouped them into a work he called \"Oboe Concerto on

instances where a work was left unfinished at the composer's death and was completed by another composer In such cases the later composer generally strives to ensure the finished product is as close

1897/98 publication \n Der westafrikanische \n Kulturkreis \n is the spread of \n cultural \n itemssuch as \n ideas \n styles \n religions \n technologies \n languages \n etc between individuals whether within a single culture or from one culture to another It is distinct from the \n diffusion of innovations \n within a specific culture Examples of diffusion include the spread of the \n war chariot \n and \n iron \n smelting \n in ancient times and the use of \n automobiles \n and Western \n business suits \n in the 20th century \n Types \n Mechanisms \n Theories \n Hyperdiffusionism \n Medieval Europe \n Disputes \n Contributors \n Notes \n Types \n Five major types of cultural diffusion have been defined \n Expansion diffusion an innovation or idea that develops in a source area and remains strong there while also spreading outward to other areas This can include hierarchical stimulus and contagious diffusion \n Relocation diffusion an idea or innovation that migrates into new areas leaving behind its origin or source of the cultural trait \n Hierarchical diffusion an idea or innovation that spreads by moving from larger to smaller places often with little regard to the distance between places and often influenced by social elites \n Contagious diffusion an idea or innovation that spreads based on person-to-person contact within a given population \n Stimulus diffusion an idea or innovation that spreads based on its attachment to another concept \n Mechanisms \n Inter-cultural diffusion can happen in many ways \n Migrating populations \n will carry their culture with them Ideas can be carried by trans-cultural visitors such as merchants \n explorers \n soldiers diplomats slaves and hired artisans Technology diffusion has often occurred by one society luring skilled scientists or workers by payments or other inducement Trans-cultural marriages between two neighboring or interspersed cultures have also contributed Among literate societies diffusion can occur through letters books and in modern times through electronic media \n There are three categories of diffusion mechanisms \n Direct diffusion \n occurs when two cultures are very close to each other resulting in intermarriage trade and even warfare An example of direct diffusion is between the \n United States \n and \n Canada \n where the people living on the border of these two countries engage in hockey which started in Canada and baseball which is popular in American culture \n Forced diffusion \n occurs when one culture subjugates conquers or enslaves another culture and forces its own customs on the conquered people An example would be the forced \n Christianization \n of the \n indigenous peoples \n of the Americas by the Spanish French English and Portuguese or the forced \n Islamization \n of West African peoples by the \n Fula \n or of the \n Nuristanis \n by the Afghans \n Indirect diffusion \n happens when traits are passed from one culture through a middleman to another culture without the first and final cultures being in direct contact An example could be the presence of \n Mexican food \n in Canada since a large territory the United States lies between \n Direct diffusion was common in ancient times when small groups of humans lived in adjoining settlements Indirect diffusion is common in today's world because of the \n mass media \n and invention of the \n Internet \n Also of interest is the work of \n American \n historian and critic \n Daniel J Boorstin \n in his book \n The Discoverers \n in which he provides an historical perspective on the role of \n explorers \n in the \n diffusion of innovations \n between \n civilizations \n Theories \n The many models that have been proposed for inter-cultural diffusion are \n Migrationism \n the spread of cultural ideas by either gradual or sudden population movements \n Culture circles \n diffusionism \n Kulturkreise \n the theory that cultures originated from a small number of cultures \n \" \n Kulturkugel \n \" a German compound meaning \"culture bullet\" \n coined \n by \n J P Mallory \n a mechanism suggested by Mallory \n to model the scale of \n invasion \n vs gradual migration vs diffusion According to this model local continuity of material culture and social organization is stronger than linguistic continuity so that cultural contact or limited migration regularly leads to linguistic changes without affecting material culture or social organization \n Hyperdiffusionism \n the theory that all cultures originated from one culture \n A concept that has often been mentioned in this regard which may be framed in the evolutionary diffusionism model is that of \"an idea whose time has come\" whereby a new cultural item appears almost simultaneously and independently in several widely separated places after certain prerequisite items have diffused across the respective communities This concept was invoked with regard to the independent development of \n calculus \n by \n Newton \n and \n Leibnitz \n and the inventions of the \n airplane \n and of the \n electronic computer \n Hyperdiffusionism \n Hyperdiffusionism in Archaeology \n Hyperdiffusionists deny that \n parallel evolution \n or independent invention took place to any great extent throughout history they claim that all major inventions and all cultures can be traced back to a single culture \n Early theories of hyperdiffusionism can be traced to ideas about \n South America \n being the origin of mankind \n Antonio de Len Pinelo \n a Spaniard who settled in \n Bolivia \n claimed in his book \n Paraso en el Nuevo Mundo \n that the \n Garden of Eden \n and the creation of man had occurred in present-day Bolivia and that the rest of the world was populated by \n migrations \n from there Similar ideas were also held by Emeterio Villamil de Rada in his book \n La Lengua de Adn \n he attempted to prove that \n Aymara \n was the original language of mankind and that humanity had originated in \n Sorata \n in the Bolivian \n Andes \n The first scientific defence of humanity originating in South America came from the Argentine \n paleontologist \n Florentino Ameghino \n in who published his research in \n La antigedad del hombre en el Plata \n The work of \n Grafton Elliot Smith \n fomented a revival of hyperdiffusionism in he asserted that \n copper \n producing knowledge spread from \n Egypt \n to the rest of the world along with \n megalithic \n culture \n Smith claimed that all major inventions had been made by the ancient \n Egyptians \n and were carried to the rest of the world by migrants and voyagers His views became known as \"Egyptocentric-Hyperdiffusionism\" \n William James Perry \n elaborated on Smith's hypothesis by using \n ethnographic \n data Another hyperdiffusionist was \n Lord Raglan \n in his book \n How Came Civilization \n he wrote that instead of Egypt all culture and civilization had come from \n Mesopotamia \n Hyperdiffusionism after this did not entirely disappear but it was generally abandoned by mainstream academia \n Medieval Europe \n Diffusion theory has been advanced \n according to whom? \n as an explanation for the \" \n European miracle \n \" the adoption of technological innovation in \n medieval Europe \n which by the 17th century culminated in European technological achievement surpassing \n the Islamic world \n and \n China \n Such technological import to medieval Europe include \n gunpowder \n clock \n mechanisms \n shipbuilding \n paper \n and the \n windmill \n however in each of these cases Europeans not only adopted the technologies but improved the manufacturing scale inherent technology and applications to a point clearly surpassing the evolution of the original invention in its country of origin \n Historians \n who? \n have questioned recently \n yearneeded \n whether Europe really owes the development of such inventions as gunpowder the compass the windmill or printing to the Chinese or other cultures \n Disputes \n Further information \n Migrationism and diffusionism \n While the concept of diffusion is well accepted in general conjectures about the existence or the extent of diffusion in some specific contexts have been hotly disputed An example of such disputes is the proposal by \n Thor Heyerdahl \n that similarities between the culture of \n Polynesia \n and the pre-Columbian civilizations of the \n Andes \n are due to diffusion from the latter to the formera theory that currently has few supporters among professional anthropologists Heyerdahl's theory of Polynesian origins has not gained acceptance among \n anthropologists \n Contributors \n This section \n does not \n cite \n any \n sources \n Please help \n improve this section

where the creator of a work retains residual rights in which case use of the work is referred to as \"under license\" or \"with permission\" \n As rights are country-based and vary a work may be subject to rights in one country and be in the public domain in another Some rights depend on registrations on a country-by-country basis and the absence of registration in a particular country if required creates public domain status for a work in that country \n Definition \n Public domain by medium \n Public domain books \n 18th century \n 19th century \n 20th century \n Public domain music

Although the term \"public domain\" did not come into use until the mid-18th century the concept \"can be traced back to the ancient Roman Law as a preset system included in the property right system \" \n The Romans had a large proprietary rights system where they defined \"many things that cannot be privately owned\" \n as \n res nullius \n res communes \n res publicae \n and \n res universitatis \n The term \n res nullius \n was defined as things not yet appropriated \n The term \n res communes \n was defined as \"things that could be commonly enjoyed by mankind such as air sunlight and ocean \" \n The term \n res publicae \n referred to things that were shared by all citizens and the term \n res universitatis \n meant things that were owned by the municipalities of Rome \n When looking at the public domain from a \n historical \n perspective one could say the construction of the idea of \"public domain\" sprouted from the concepts of \n res communes \n res publicae \n and \n res universitatis \n in early \n Roman law \n When the first early copyright law was first established in Britain with the \n Statute of Anne \n in public domain did not appear However similar concepts were developed by British and French jurists in the eighteenth century Instead of \"public domain\" they used terms such as \n publici juris \n or \n proprit publique \n to describe works that were not covered by copyright law \n The phrase \"fall in the public domain\" can be traced to mid-nineteenth century France to describe the end of \n copyright term \n The French poet \n Alfred de Vigny \n equated the expiration of copyright with a work falling \"into the sink hole of the public domain\" \n and if the public domain receives any attention from intellectual property lawyers it is still treated as little more than that which is left when intellectual property rights such as \n copyright \n patents \n and \n trademarks \n expire or are abandoned \n In this historical context Paul Torremans describes copyright as a \"little coral reef of private right jutting up from the ocean of the public domain \" \n Because copyright law is different from country to country \n Pamela Samuelson \n has described the public domain as being \"different sizes at different times in different countries\" \n Definition \n Newton's \n own copy of his \n Principia \n with hand-written corrections for the second edition \n Definitions of the boundaries of the public domain in relation to copyright or intellectual property more generally regard the public domain as a negative space that is it consists of works that are no longer in copyright term or were never protected by copyright law \n According to \n James Boyle \n this definition underlines common usage of the term \n public domain \n and equates the public domain to \n public property \n and works in copyright to \n private property \n However the usage of the term \n public domain \n can be more granular including for example uses of works in copyright permitted by \n copyright exceptions \n Such a definition regards work in copyright as private property subject to \n fair use \n rights and limitation on ownership \n A conceptual definition comes from Lange who focused on what the public domain should be \"it should be a place of sanctuary for individual creative expression a sanctuary conferring affirmative protection against the forces of private appropriation that threatened such expression\" \n Patterson and Lindberg described the public domain not as a \"territory\" but rather as a concept \" T here are certain materials the air we breathe sunlight rain space life creations thoughts feelings ideas words numbers not subject to private ownership The materials that compose our cultural heritage must be free for all living to use no less than matter necessary for biological survival \" \n The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise and/or undefined terms such as the \" \n public sphere \n \" or \" \n commons \n \" including concepts such as \"commons of the mind\" the \"intellectual commons\" and the \"information commons\" \n Public

All this laid the foundation for the preservation of global music belonging to the public domain since the beginning of musical history to the present \n The \n Musopen \n project records music in the

recorded by Museopen and offer them for download/distribution as a public service \n Play media \n Rock Rock Rock \n Public domain films \n Public domain film \n A \n public domain film \n is a \n

animated movies and noir to western movies \n citation needed \n Value \n Pamela Samuelson \n has identified eight \"values\" that can arise from information and works in the public domain \n Possible values include \n Building blocks for the creation of new knowledge examples include data facts ideas theories and scientific principle \n Access to cultural heritage through information resources such as ancient Greek texts and Mozart's symphonies \n Promoting education through the spread of information ideas and scientific principles \n Enabling follow-on innovation through for example expired patents and copyright \n Enabling low cost access to information without the need to locate the owner or negotiate rights clearance and pay royalties through for example expired copyrighted works or patents and non-original data compilation \n Promoting public health and safety through information and scientific principles \n Promoting the democratic process and values through news laws regulation and judicial opinion \n Enabling competitive imitation through for example expired patents and copyright or publicly disclosed technologies that do not qualify for patent protection \n Relationship with derivative works \n L H O O Q \n Derivative work by the \n Dadaist \n Marcel Duchamp \n based on the \n Mona Lisa \n Derivative works \n include \n translations \n musical arrangements \n and \n dramatizations \n of a work as well as other forms of transformation or adaptation \n Copyrighted works may not be used for derivative works without permission from the copyright owner \n while public domain works can be freely used for derivative works without permission \n Artworks that are public domain may also be reproduced photographically or artistically or used as the basis of new interpretive works \n Works derived from public domain works can be copyrighted \n Once works enter into the public domain derivative works such as adaptations in book and film may increase noticeably as happened with \n Frances Hodgson Burnett \n 's novel \n The Secret Garden \n which became public domain in \n By the plays of Shakespeare all public domain had been used in more than feature-length films \n In addition to straightforward adaptation they have been used as the launching point for transformative retellings such as \n Tom Stoppard \n 's \n Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead \n and \n Troma Entertainment \n 's \n Romeo and Juliet \n Marcel Duchamp's \n L H O O Q \n is a derivative of Leonardo da Vinci's \n Mona Lisa \n one of thousands of derivative works based on the public domain painting \n Perpetual copyright \n Perpetual copyright \n Some works may never fully lapse into the public domain A perpetual \n crown copyright \n is held for the \n Authorized King James Version \n of the Bible in the UK \n While the copyright of the Peter Pan works by \n J M Barrie \n the play \n Peter Pan or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up \n and the novel \n Peter and Wendy \n has expired in the United Kingdom it was granted a special exception under the Copyright Designs and Patents Act Schedule \n that requires royalties to be paid for commercial performances publications and broadcasts of the story of Peter Pan within the UK as long as \n Great Ormond Street Hospital \n to whom Barrie gave the copyright continues to exist \n Public domain mark \n Creative Commons \n ' \n Public Domain Mark \n The \n Creative Commons \n proposed in the \n Public Domain Mark \n PDM as \n symbol \n to indicate that a work is free of known \n copyright \n restrictions and therefore in the public domain \n The public domain mark is analogous to the \n copyright symbol \n which acts as \n copyright notice \n The \n Europeana \n databases use it and for instance on the \n Wikimedia Commons \n in February million works ~10% of all works are listed as \n PDM \n Application to copyrightable works \n Works not covered by copyright law \n The underlying \n idea \n that is expressed or manifested in the creation of a work generally cannot be the subject of copyright law see \n ideaexpression divide \n Mathematical formulae will therefore generally form part of the public domain to the extent that their expression in the form of software is not covered by copyright \n Works created before the existence of copyright and patent laws also form part of the public domain For example \n the Bible \n and the inventions of \n Archimedes \n are in the public domain but copyright may exist in translations or new formulations or digitized editions of these works so for example most translations of the Bible into foreign languages and the digital editions of these are copyrighted \n Expiration of copyright \n Determination of whether a copyright has expired depends on an examination of the copyright in its \"source country\" \n In the United States determining whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright can be quite complex primarily because \n copyright terms \n have been extended multiple times and in different waysshifting over the course of the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication with a possible renewal term to a term extending to fifty then seventy years after the death of the author The claim that \"pre-1923 works are in the public domain\" is correct only for published works unpublished works are under federal copyright for at least the life of the author plus years \n In most other countries that are signatories to the \n Berne Convention \n copyright term is based on the life of the author and extends to or years beyond the death of the author See \n List of countries' copyright lengths \n Legal traditions differ on whether a work in the public domain can have its copyright restored In the European Union the \n Copyright Duration Directive \n was applied retroactively restoring and extending the terms of copyright on material previously in the public domain Term extensions by the U S and Australia generally have not removed works from the public domain but rather delayed the addition of works to it However the United States moved away from that tradition with the \n Uruguay Round Agreements Act \n which removed from the public domain many foreign-sourced works that had previously not been in copyright in the US for failure to comply with US-based \n formalities requirements \n Consequently in the US foreign-sourced works and US-sourced works are now treated differently with foreign-sourced works remaining under copyright regardless of compliance with formalities while domestically-sourced works may be in the public domain if they failed to comply with then-existing formalities requirementsa situation described as odd by some scholars and unfair by some US-based rightsholders \n Government works \n Works of the United States Government \n and various other governments are excluded from copyright law and may therefore be considered to be in the public domain in their respective countries \n In the United States when copyrighted material is enacted into the law it enters the public domain Thus e g the \n building codes \n when enacted are in the public domain \n They may also be in the public domain in other countries as well \"It is axiomatic that material in the public domain is not protected by copyright even when incorporated into a copyrighted work \" \n Dedicating works to the public domain \n Release without copyright notice \n Before in the US works could be easily given into the public domain by just releasing it without an explicit \n Copyright notice \n With the \n Berne Convention \n Implementation Act of and the earlier \n Copyright Act of \n which went into effect in all works were by default copyright protected and needed to be actively given into public domain by a \n waiver \n statement/ \n anti-copyright notice \n Not all legal systems have processes for reliably donating works to the public domain e g \n civil law \n of \n continental Europe \n citation needed \n This may even \"effectively prohibit any attempt by copyright owners to surrender rights automatically conferred by law particularly \n moral rights \n \" \n Public domain like licenses \n Public domain equivalent license \n An alternative is for copyright holders to issue a licence which irrevocably grants as many rights as possible to the general public Real public domain makes \n licenses \n unnecessary as no owner/author is required to grant permission \" \n Permission culture \n \" There are multiple licenses which aim to release works into the public domain In the \n WTFPL \n was released as a public domain like \n software license \n In the \n Creative commons \n released the \n CC0 \n which was created for \n compatibility \n with law domains which have no concept of \n dedicating into public domain \n This is achieved by a public domain waiver statement and a fall-back all-permissive license in case the waiver is not possible \n The \n Unlicense \n published around has a focus on an \n Anti-copyright \n message The Unlicense offers a public domain waiver text with a fall-back public domain-like license inspired by permissive licenses but without attribution \n In October the \n Open Knowledge Foundation \n recommends the Creative Commons \n CC0 \n license to dedicate content to the public domain \n and the \n Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License PDDL \n for data \n Patents \n Term of patent \n In most countries the term or rights for patents is years after which the invention becomes part of the public domain In the United States the contents of patents are considered valid and enforceable for twenty years from the date of filing within the United States or twenty years from the earliest date of filing if under USC or c \n However the \n text \n and any \n illustration \n within a patent provided the illustrations are essentially line drawings and do not in any substantive way reflect the \"personality\" of the person drawing them are not subject to copyright protection \n This is separate from the \n patent \n rights just mentioned \n Trademarks \n A trademark registration may remain in force indefinitely or expire without specific regard to its age For a trademark registration to remain valid the owner must continue to use it In some circumstances such as disuse failure to assert trademark rights or common usage by the public without regard for its intended use it could become \n generic \n and therefore part of the public domain \n Because trademarks are registered with governments some countries or trademark registries may recognize a mark while others may have determined that it is generic and not allowable as a trademark in that registry For example the drug \"acetylsalicylic acid\" 2-acetoxybenzoic acid is better known as \n aspirin \n in the United Statesa generic term In Canada however \"Aspirin\" with an uppercase A is still a trademark of the German company \n Bayer \n while aspirin with a lowercase \"a\" is not Bayer lost the trademark in the United States the UK and France after World War I as part of the \n Treaty of Versailles \n So many copycat products entered the marketplace during the war that it was deemed generic just three years later \n Bayer also lost the trademark in the same jurisdictions for \"Heroin\" which it trademarked a year before it trademarked Aspirin \n citation needed \n Although \n Hormel \n resigned itself to genericide \n it has fought attempts by other companies to register \" \n spam \n \" as a \n trademark \n in relation to computer products \n Public Domain Day \n Public Domain Day \n An English logo of the 2015/2016 Public Domain Day in Poland \n Public Domain Day \n is an observance of when \n copyrights \n expire and works enter into the public domain \n This legal transition of copyright works into the public domain usually happens every year on January based on the individual \n copyright laws of each country \n The observance of a \"Public Domain Day\" was initially informal the earliest known mention was in by Wallace McLean a Canadian public domain activist \n with support for the idea echoed by \n Lawrence Lessig \n As of January \n update \n a

non-binding document released as a result of Rio+20 Conference held in in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil \n The SDGs were in large measure informed by the often quoted assertion by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that \"we dont have plan B because there is no planet B\" \n On July the \n UN General Assembly \n 's Open Working Group OWG on Sustainable Development Goals SDGs forwarded a proposal for the SDGs to the Assembly The proposal contained goals with targets covering a broad range of \n sustainable development \n issues These included ending \n poverty \n and \n

and productive environment \n It was not until that the United Nations decided to create the World Commission on Environment and Development which defined sustainable development as \"meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\" In the first \n United Nations Conference on Environment and Development \n was held in Rio The first agenda for Environment and Development also known as Agenda was developed and adopted in Rio \n Official logos for each of the Millennium Development Goals \n In preparation for the \n Rio+20 \n Conference Indonesia held a July government retreat in Solo Indonesia At this event \n Colombia \n proposed the idea of the SDGs This was picked up by the United nations Department of Public Information 64th NGO Conference in September in Bonn where the outcome document proposed sustainable development goals and associated targets In the run-up to Rio+20 there was much discussion about the idea of SDGs At the Rio+20 Conference a resolution known as \n The Future We Want \n was reached by member states Among the key themes agreed on were poverty eradication energy water and sanitation health and human settlement \n Paragraph of the Future We Want outcome document forms the link between the Rio+20 agreement and the \n Millennium Development Goals \n \"We recognize that the development of goals could also be useful for pursuing focused and coherent action on sustainable development The goals should address and incorporate in a balanced way all three dimensions of sustainable development environment economics and society and their interlinkages The development of these goals should not divert focus or effort from the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals\" Paragraph states that \"the process needs to be coordinated and coherent with the processes to consider the post-2015 development agenda\" \n Taken together paragraph and paved the way for the \n Millennium Development Goals \n MDGs \n The MDGs were officially established following the \n Millennium Summit \n of the United Nations in and the agreement in the Future We Want outcome document The Rio+20 summit also agreed that the process of designing sustainable development goals should be \"action-oriented concise and easy to communicate limited in number aspirational global in nature and universally applicable to all countries while taking into account different national realities capacities and levels of development and respecting national policies and priorities\" \n Because the MDGs were to be achieved by a further process was needed Discussion of the post-2015 framework for international development began well in advance with the United Nations System Task Team on Post Development Agenda \n releasing the first report known as \n Realizing The Future We Want \n The Report was the first attempt to achieve the requirements under paragraph and of the \n Future We Want \n document It identified four dimensions as part of a global vision for sustainable development Inclusive Social Development Environmental Sustainability Inclusive Economic Development and Peace and

listing the Sustainable Development Goals \n Further information \n Post-2015 Development Agenda \n On September the countries of the UN General Assembly adopted the Development Agenda titled \n Transforming our world the Agenda for Sustainable Development \n Following the adoption UN agencies under the umbrella of the \n United Nations Development Group \n decided to support an independent campaign to help communicate the agreed Sustainable Development Goals to a wider constituency Known as Project Everyone \n the independent campaign introduced the term \n Global Goals \n and was supported by corporate institutions and other International Organizations Because this decision was made without the approval of the member states it met resistance \n In addition several sections of civil society and governments felt \n the UNDG ignored \"sustainability \" even though it was the most important aspect of the agreement That the term \"Global Goals\" also refers to several other processes not related to the United Nations was another concern \n The Official Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted on September has paragraphs Paragraph outlines the Sustainable Development Goals and the associated targets \n The SDGs are listed below together with some of their key facts and figures \n Goal No Poverty \n No Poverty \n - End \n poverty \n in all its forms everywhere \n Extreme poverty has been cut by more than half since 1990- however more than in people live on less than $1 a day \n Poverty is more than lack of income or resources- it includes lack of basic services such as education hunger social discrimination and exclusion and lack of participation in decision making \n Gender inequality plays a large role in the perpetuation of poverty and its risks They then face potentially life-threatening risks from early pregnancy and often lost hopes for an education and a better income \n Age groups are affected differently when struck with poverty its most devastating effects are on children to whom it poses a great threat It affects their education health nutrition and security It also negatively affects the emotional and spiritual development of children through the environment it creates \n Goal Zero Hunger \n Zero Hunger \n - \n End hunger \n achieve \n food security \n and improved nutrition and promote \n sustainable agriculture \n Globally in people are undernourished the vast majority of these people live in developing countries \n Agriculture is the single largest employer in the world providing livelihoods for per cent of todays global population It is the largest source of income and jobs for poor rural households Women comprise on average per cent of the agricultural labor force in developing countries and over per cent in parts of Asia and Africa yet they only own 20% of the land \n Poor nutrition causes nearly half per cent of deaths in children under five million children each year \n Goal targets \n By end hunger and ensure access by all people in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations including infants to safe nutritious and sufficient food all year round \n By end all forms of malnutrition including achieving by the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under years of age and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls pregnant and lactating women and older persons \n By double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers in particular women indigenous peoples family farmers pastoralists and fishers including through secure and equal access to land other productive resources and inputs knowledge financial services markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment \n By ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production that help maintain ecosystems that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change extreme weather drought flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality \n By maintain the genetic diversity of seeds cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national regional and international levels and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge as internationally agreed \n Increase investment including through enhanced international cooperation in rural infrastructure agricultural research and extension services technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries in particular least developed countries \n Correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets including through the parallel elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect in accordance with the mandate of the Doha Development Round \n Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information including on food reserves in order to help limit extreme food price volatility \n Goal Good Health and Well-being \n Good Health and Well-being \n - Ensure healthy lives and promote \n well-being \n for all at all ages \n Significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated with child and maternal mortality and major progress has been made on increasing access to clean water and sanitation reducing malaria tuberculosis polio and the spread of HIV/AIDS \n However only half of women in developing countries have received the health care they need and the need for family planning is increasing exponentially while the need met is growing slowly - more than million women have an unmet need for contraception \n An important target is to substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from \n pollution-related diseases \n By reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than per live births \n By end preventable deaths of newborns and children under years of age with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as per live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as per live births \n By end the epidemics of AIDS tuberculosis malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases \n By reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being \n Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol \n By halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents \n By ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services including for family planning information and education and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes \n Achieve universal health coverage including financial risk protection access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe effective quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all \n By substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air water and soil pollution and contamination \n Goal Quality Education \n Quality Education \n - Ensure \n inclusive \n and \n equitable \n quality education and promote \n lifelong learning \n opportunities for all \n Major progress has been made for education access specifically at the primary school level for both boys and girls However access does not always mean quality of education or completion of primary school Currently million youth worldwide still lack basic literacy skills and more than per cent of them are women \n Target \"By ensure that all girls and boys complete free equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and Goal-4 effective learning outcomes\"- shows the commitment to nondiscriminatory education outcomes \n Goal Gender Equality \n Gender Equality \n - Achieve \n gender equality \n and \n empower \n all women and girls \n Providing women and girls with equal access to education health care decent work and representation in political and economic decision-making processes will fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large \n While a record countries guaranteed equality between men and women in their Constitutions by another had not taken this step In many nations gender discrimination is still woven through legal and social norms \n Though goal is the gender equality stand-alone goal the SDG's can only be successful if women are completely integrated into each and every goal \n Goal Clean Water and Sanitation \n Clean Water and Sanitation - Ensure \n availability \n and sustainable management of water and \n sanitation \n for all \n The first three out of eight targets include \n \"By achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable \n drinking water \n for all \" \n \"By achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and \n hygiene \n for all and end \n open defecation \n paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations \" \n \"By improve water quality by reducing \n pollution \n eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials halving the proportion of untreated \n wastewater \n and substantially increasing recycling and \n safe reuse \n globally \" \n WASH \n experts have stated that without progress on Goal the other goals and targets cannot be achieved \n Safe drinking water and hygienic toilets protect people from disease and enable societies to be productive Attending school and work without disruption is a precursor to education and employment both of which are the foundation of alleviating poverty A study from showed how sanitation when done with a resource recovery and reuse focus can contribute towards achieving at least fourteen of the SDGs especially in an urban context \n Recovering the resources embedded in excreta and wastewater like nutrients water and energy contributes towards achieving Goal sustainable consumption and production and Goal zero hunger while ensuring adequate sanitation and wastewater management along the entire value chain in cities contributes to Goal sustainable cities and communities Goal no poverty and Goal decent work and economic growth \n Goal Affordable and Clean Energy \n Affordable and Clean Energy - Ensure access to affordable reliable \n sustainable \n and modern energy for all \n Goal targets \n By ensure universal access to affordable reliable and modern energy services \n By increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix \n By double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency \n By enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology including renewable energy energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology \n By expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries in particular least developed countries small island developing States and land-locked developing countries in accordance with their respective programmes of support \n Goal Decent Work and Economic Growth \n Decent Work and Economic Growth - Promote sustained inclusive and \n sustainable economic growth \n full and productive employment and \n decent work \n for all \n World Pensions Council WPC \n development economists have argued that the twin considerations of long-term economic growth and infrastructure investment werent prioritized enough \n More worryingly Work and Economic Growth and Technological Innovation and Infrastructure Investment joined the \n SDGs \n priority list at number and number respectively a rather mediocre ranking which dees economic common sense \n Goal targets \n Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and in particular at least per cent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries \n Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification technological upgrading and innovation including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors \n Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities decent job creation entrepreneurship creativity and innovation and encourage the formalization and growth of micro- small- and medium-sized enterprises including through access to financial services \n Improve progressively through global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation in accordance with the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production with developed countries taking the lead \n By achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men including for young people and persons with disabilities and equal pay for work of equal value \n By substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment education or training \n Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour including recruitment and use of child soldiers and by end child labour in all its forms \n Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers including migrant workers in particular women migrants and those in precarious employment \n By devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products \n Strengthen the capacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand access to banking insurance and financial services for all \n Increase Aid for Trade support for developing countries in particular least developed countries including through the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries \n By develop and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment and implement the Global Jobs Pact of the International Labour Organization \n Goal Industry Innovation and Infrastructure \n Industry Innovation and Infrastructure - Build \n resilient \n infrastructure \n promote inclusive and \n sustainable industrialization \n and foster \n innovation \n Goal Reduced Inequalities \n Reduced Inequalities - Reduce income \n inequality \n within and among countries \n Goal Sustainable Cities and Communities \n Sustainable Cities and Communities - Make cities and human settlements inclusive safe resilient and sustainable \n Goal Responsible Consumption and Production \n Responsible Consumption and Production - Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns \n Goal Climate Action \n Climate Action - Take urgent action to combat \n climate change \n and its impacts by regulating emissions and promoting developments in renewable energy \n Nations and other parties negotiating at the UN have highlighted the links between the post-2015 SDG process the \n Financing for Development \n process to be concluded in Addis Ababa in July and the \n COP \n Climate Change conference in Paris in December \n In May a report concluded that only a very ambitious climate deal in Paris in will enable countries to reach the sustainable development goals and targets \n The report also states that tackling climate change will only be possible if the SDGs are met Further development and climate are inextricably linked particularly around poverty gender equality and energy The UN encourages the public sector to take initiative in this effort to minimize negative impacts on the environment \n This renewed emphasis on climate change mitigation was made possible by the partial \n Sino-American \n convergence that developed in 2015-2016 notably at the UN \n COP21 \n summit Paris and ensuing \n G20 \n conference Hangzhou \n Goal Life Below Water \n Life Below Water - \n Conserve \n and sustainably use the oceans seas and \n marine resources \n for sustainable development \n The \n United Nations Ocean Conference \n of sought to find ways and call for the implemention of Sustainable Development Goal \n Goal Life on Land \n Life on Land - Protect restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial \n ecosystems \n sustainably manage forests combat \n desertification \n and halt and reverse \n land degradation \n and halt \n biodiversity \n loss \n Goal Peace Justice and Strong Institutions \n Peace Justice and Strong Institutions - Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for \n sustainable development \n provide \n access to justice \n for all and build effective accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels \n Goal Partnerships for the Goals \n Partnerships for the Goals - Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for \n sustainable development \n Targets and indicators \n As of August there were proposed targets for these goals and proposed indicators to show compliance \n The process for arriving at the Post-2015 development agenda \n Since Rio+20 did not elaborate specific goals a 30-member Open Working Group OWG was established on January by the decision of the UN General Assembly The OWG was tasked with preparing a proposal on the SDGs for consideration during the 68th session of the General Assembly September September \n The OWG used a constituency-based system of representation most of the seats in the working group are shared by several countries After sessions the OWG submitted their proposal of SDGs and targets to the 68th session of the UN General Assembly in September \n The Rio+20 outcome document mentioned at the outset the OWG will decide on its methods of work including developing modalities to ensure the full involvement of relevant stakeholders and expertise from civil society the scientific community and the United Nations system in its work in order to provide a diversity of perspectives and experience \n Critique \n A report by the \n International Food Policy Research Institute \n IFPRI of criticized the SDGs for not being ambitious enough They cite evidence from the report \"An Ambitious Development Goal Ending Hunger and Undernutrition by 2025\" to suggest the emphasis should not be on an end to poverty by but on eliminating hunger and under-nutrition by The assertion is based on an analysis of experiences in China Vietnam Brazil and Thailand The report identifies pathways to achieving the goal by agriculture-led social protection- and nutrition intervention-led or a combination of both of these approaches \n The SDGs have been criticized for being contradictory because in seeking high levels of global \n GDP growth \n they will undermine their own \n ecological \n objectives It has also been noted that in relation to the headline goal of eliminating extreme poverty \"a growing number of scholars are pointing out that $1 is actually not adequate for human \n subsistence \n \" and the poverty line should be revised to as high as $5 \n A commentary in \n The Economist \n argued that targets for the SDGs is too many The article used descriptors like \"sprawling\" \"misconceived\" and \"a mess\" compared to the \n Millennium Development Goals \n Another criticsm is that the goals ignore local context and promote \"cookie-cutter development policies\" That all other sustainable development goals are contingent on achieving SDG ending poverty \n The Economist \n estimated that alleviating poverty and achieving the other sustainable development goals will require about $2-$3 trillion USD per annum for the next years Critics do not see this as being feasible The reduction in the number of people living in abject poverty can be attributed to the growth of China while the MDGs have been mistakenly credited for this drop \n The SDGs have also been criticized due to the inherent shortcomings in the very concept of sustainable development and the inability of the latter to either stabilize rising carbon dioxide concentration or ensure environmental harmony \n Another view is more positive The SDGs were the first outcome from a UN conference that was not criticized by any major Non-Governmental Organization NGO Instead there was broad support from NGOs This is in stark contrast to the MDGs which were heavily criticized by NGOs The MDGs dealt with the problems the SDGs deal with the causes of the problems The MDGs were about development while the SDGs are about sustainable development Finally the MDGs used a silo approach to problem while the SDGs take into account the inter-linkages \n Nearly all stakeholders engaged in negotiations to develop the SDGs agreed that goals were justified because the agenda they address is all encompassing \n Implementation \n Implementation of the SDGs has started worldwide It is no easy task however In each country the goals must be translated into national legislation Poor countries need the support of rich countries and coordination at the international level is crucial \n The Agenda is very ambitious and there are many obstacles For instance Goal to eradicate poverty is hampered by growing inequality increasingly fragile statehood and the impacts of climate change \n Cross-cutting issues \n Women and gender equality \n Despite a stand-alone goal on gender equality there is widespread consensus that progress on any and all of the SDGs will be stalled if women's empowerment and gender equality is not prioritized Arguments and evidence from sources as diverse and as economically-oriented as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD to expected sources such as UN Women bolster the case that investments in women and girls impact national and global development in ways that exceed their initial scope \n SDG-driven investment \n Capital stewardship \n is expected to play a crucial part in the progressive advancement of the SDG agenda across all \n asset classes \n No longer \n absentee landlords \n pension fund \n trustees have started to exercise more forcefully their \n governance \n prerogatives across the boardrooms of \n Britain \n Benelux \n and \n America \n coming together through the establishment of engaged pressure groups to shift the whole economic system towards sustainable investment \n The \n boards of directors \n of large Dutch and Scandinavian public and sectorial pension funds were early adopters of this SDG-driven approach in March Hollands Pensionfund Metalektro PME the main retirement scheme for the metal and electrical engineering sector announced it would bring rapidly 10% of its $49 billion investment portfolio in line with the UN SDGs \n Education \n Education for sustainable development ESD \n See main article \n Education for sustainable development \n Education for sustainable development ESD is explicitly recognized in the SDGs as part of Target of the SDG on education together with \n Global Citizenship Education \n GCED which UNESCO promotes as a complementary approach \n At the same time it is important to emphasize ESDs crucial importance for all the other SDGs With its overall aim to develop cross-cutting sustainability competencies in learners ESD is an essential contribution to all efforts to achieve the SDGs enabling individuals to contribute to sustainable development by promoting societal economic and political change as well as by transforming their own behaviour \n Massive open online course MOOC \n Massive open online course \n MOOCs can be seen as a form of open education offered for free through online platforms The initial philosophy of MOOCs is to open up quality \n Higher Education \n to a wider audience As such MOOCs are an important tool to achieve Goal of the Agenda for Sustainable Development \"Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\" \n They could also make an important contribution to SDG \"Achieve gender equality and empower all women

\n Innovation management is based on some of the ideas put forth by the Austrian economist \n Joseph Schumpeter \n working during the 1930s who identified innovation as a significant factor in economic growth \n His book \n Capitalism Socialism and Democracy \n first fully developed the concept of \n creative destruction \n Innovation management helps an organization grasp an opportunity

support are essential to innovation pursuits \n Managing complex innovation \n Innovation is often a \n technological change \n that outperforms a previous practice To lead or sustain with innovations managers need to concentrate heavily on the innovation network which requires deep understanding of the complexity of innovation Collaboration is an important source of innovation Innovations are increasingly brought to the market by networks of firms selected according to their comparative advantages and operating in a coordinated manner \n When a technology goes through a major transformation phase and yields a successful innovation it becomes a great learning experience not only for the parent industry but other industries as well Big innovations are generally the outcome of intra- and interdisciplinary networking among technological sectors along with combination of implicit and explicit knowledge Networking is required but network integration is the key to success

terms have been proposed that focus on different aspects of this societal development The British \n polymath \n crystallographer \n J D Bernal \n introduced the term \" \n scientific and technical revolution \n \" in his book \n The Social Function of Science \n to describe the new role that science and technology are coming to play within society He asserted that science is becoming a \"productive force\" using the \n Marxist \n Theory of Productive Forces \n After some controversy the term was taken up by authors and institutions of the then- \n Soviet Bloc \n Their aim was to show that \n socialism \n was a safe home for the scientific and technical \"technological\" for some authors revolution referred to by the acronym STR The book \n Civilization at the Crossroads \n edited by the Czech \n philosopher \n Radovan Richta \n became a standard reference for this topic \n Daniel Bell \n challenged this theory and advocated \n post-industrial society \n which would lead to a \n service economy \n rather than \n socialism \n Many other authors presented their views including \n Zbigniew Brzezinski \n with his \"Technetronic Society\" \n Information in social and economic activities \n The theory of information revolution \n Measuring and modeling the information revolution \n Bibliography \n Information in social and economic activities \n The main feature of the information revolution is the growing economic social and technological role of \n information \n Information-related activities did not come up with the Information Revolution They existed in one form or the other in all human societies and eventually developed into institutions such as the \n Platonic Academy \n Aristotle \n 's \n Peripatetic school \n in the \n Lyceum \n the \n Musaeum \n and the \n Library of Alexandria \n or the schools of \n Babylonian astronomy \n The \n Agricultural Revolution \n and the \n Industrial Revolution \n came up when new informational inputs were produced by individual innovators or by scientific and technical institutions During the Information Revolution all these activities are experiencing continuous growth while other information-oriented activities are emerging \n Information is the central theme of several new sciences which emerged in the 1940s including \n Shannon \n 's \n Information Theory \n and \n Wiener \n 's \n Cybernetics \n Wiener stated \"information is information not matter or energy\" This aphorism suggests that information should be considered along with \n matter \n and \n energy \n as the third constituent part of the Universe information is carried by matter or by energy \n By the 1990s some writers believed that changes implied by the Information revolution will lead to not only a fiscal crisis for governments but also the disintegration of all \"large structures\" \n The theory of information revolution \n The term \n information revolution \n may relate to or contrast with such widely used terms as \n Industrial Revolution \n and \n Agricultural Revolution \n Note however that you may prefer mentalist to materialist paradigm The following fundamental aspects of the theory of information revolution can be given \n The object of economic activities can be conceptualized according to the fundamental distinction between matter energy and information These apply both to the object of each economic activity as well as within each economic activity or enterprise For instance an industry may process matter e g iron using energy and information production and process technologies management etc \n Information is a \n factor of production \n along with \n capital \n labor \n land economics \n as well as a \n product \n sold in the \n market \n that is a \n commodity \n As such it acquires \n use value \n and \n exchange value \n and therefore a \n price \n All products have use value exchange value and informational value The latter can be measured by the information content of the product in terms of innovation design etc \n Industries develop information-generating activities the so-called \n Research and Development \n R&D \n functions \n Enterprises and society at large develop the information control and processing functions in the form of management structures these are also called \" \n white-collar workers \n \" \" \n bureaucracy \n \" \"managerial functions\" etc \n Labor can be classified according to the object of labor into information labor and non-information labor \n Information activities constitute a large new economic sector the information sector along with the traditional \n primary sector \n secondary sector \n and \n tertiary sector \n according to the \n three-sector hypothesis \n These should be restated because they are based on the ambiguous definitions made by \n Colin Clark \n who included in the tertiary sector all activities that have not been included in the primary agriculture forestry etc and secondary manufacturing sectors \n The \n quaternary sector \n and the \n quinary sector of the economy \n attempt to classify these new activities but their definitions are not based on a clear conceptual scheme although the latter is considered by some as equivalent with the information sector \n From a strategic point of view sectors can be defined as information sector \n means of production \n means of consumption \n thus extending the classical \n Ricardo \n - \n Marx \n model of the \n Capitalist mode of production \n see \n Influences on Karl Marx \n Marx \n stressed in many occasions the role of the \"intellectual element\" in production but failed to find a place for it into his model \n Innovations are the result of the production of new information as new products new methods of production \n patents \n etc \n Diffusion of innovations \n manifests saturation effects related term \n market saturation \n following certain cyclical patterns and creating \"economic waves\" also referred to as \" \n business cycles \n \" There are various types of waves such as \n Kondratiev wave \n years \n Kuznets swing \n years \n Juglar cycle \n years and \n Kitchin \n about years see also \n Joseph Schumpeter \n distinguished by their nature duration and thus economic impact \n Diffusion of innovations causes structural-sectoral shifts in the economy which can be smooth or can create crisis and renewal a process which \n Joseph Schumpeter \n called vividly \" \n creative destruction \n \" \n From a different perspective \n Irving E Fang \n identified six 'Information Revolutions' writing printing mass media entertainment the 'tool shed' which we call 'home' now and the information highway In this work the term 'information revolution' is used in a narrow sense to describe trends in communication media \n Measuring and modeling the information revolution \n Porat measured the information sector in the US using the \n input-output analysis \n OECD \n has included statistics on the information sector in the economic reports of its member countries \n Veneris explored the theoretical economic and regional aspects of the informational revolution and developed a \n systems dynamics \n simulation \n computer model \n These works can be seen as following the path originated with the work of \n Fritz Machlup \n who in his book \"The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States\" claimed that the \"knowledge industry represented 29% of the US gross national product\" which he saw as evidence that the \n Information Age \n had begun He defines knowledge as a commodity and attempts to measure the magnitude of the production and distribution of this commodity within a modern economy Machlup divided information use into three classes instrumental intellectual and pastime knowledge He identified also five types of knowledge practical knowledge intellectual knowledge that is general culture and the satisfying of intellectual curiosity pastime knowledge that is knowledge satisfying non-intellectual curiosity or the desire for light entertainment and emotional stimulation spiritual or religious knowledge unwanted knowledge accidentally acquired and aimlessly retained \n More recent estimates have reached the following results \n the worlds technological capacity to receive information through one-way \n broadcast \n networks grew at a sustained compound annual growth rate of 7% between and \n the world's technological capacity to store information grew at a sustained compound annual growth rate of 25% between and \n the world's effective capacity to exchange information through two-way \n telecommunication \n networks grew at a sustained compound annual growth rate of 30%

products the lifespan may be quite short \n The TLC associated with a product or technological service is different from product life-cycle PLC dealt with in \n product life-cycle management \n The latter is concerned with the life of a product in the marketplace with respect to timing of introduction marketing measures and business costs The \n technology \n underlying the product for example that of a uniquely flavoured tea may be quite marginal but the process of creating and managing its life as a branded product will be very different \n citation needed \n The technology life cycle is concerned with the time and cost of developing the technology the timeline of recovering cost and modes of making the technology yield a profit proportionate to the costs and risks involved The TLC may further be protected during its cycle with \n patents \n and \n trademarks \n seeking to lengthen the cycle and to maximize the profit from it \n The \n product \n of the technology may be a commodity such as \n polyethylene \n plastic or a sophisticated product like the \n integrated circuits \n used in a \n smartphone \n The development of a \n competitive product \n or process can have a major effect on the lifespan of the technology making it shorter Equally the loss of intellectual property rights through litigation or loss of its secret elements if any through leakages also work to reduce a technology's lifespan Thus it is apparent that the \n management \n of the TLC is an important aspect of technology development \n Most new technologies follow a similar technology maturity lifecycle describing the \n technological maturity \n of a product This is not similar to a \n product life cycle \n but applies to an entire technology or a generation of a technology \n Technology adoption is the most common phenomenon driving the evolution of industries along the industry lifecycle After expanding new uses of resources they end with exhausting the efficiency of those processes producing gains that are first easier and larger over time then exhaustingly more difficult as the \n technology matures \n In fact many authors sustain that actual economical trends presents clear symptoms of technological maturity with particular attention to many traditional industrial sectors including automotive and aeronautical ones \n Those considerations allows a clear verification of the state of technological maturity of the largest part of today transport vehicles industrial sector and that sustainability action are necessary for both reducing \n environmental impact \n and levels of technological maturity \n The four phases of the technology life-cycle \n S-curve \n Technology perception dynamics \n Licensing options \n Licensing in the R&D phase \n Licensing in the ascent phase \n Licensing in the maturity phase \n Licensing in the decline phase \n Technology development cycle \n The four phases of the technology life-cycle \n The TLC may be seen as composed of four phases \n The \n research and development R&D \n phase sometimes called the \"bleeding edge\" when incomes from inputs are negative and where the prospects of failure are high \n The \n ascent \n phase when out-of-pocket costs have been recovered and the technology begins to gather strength by going beyond some Point A on the TLC sometimes called the \"leading edge\" \n The \n maturity \n phase when gain is high and stable the region going into saturation marked by M and \n The \n decline \n or decay phase after a Point D of reducing fortunes and utility of the technology \n S-curve \n The shape of the technology lifecycle is often referred to as S-curve \n Technology perception dynamics \n There is usually \n technology hype \n at the introduction of any new technology but only after some time has passed can it be judged as mere hype or justified true acclaim Because of the \n logistic curve \n nature of technology adoption it is difficult to see in the early stages whether the hype is excessive \n The two errors commonly committed in the early stages of a technology's development are \n citation needed \n fitting an exponential curve to the first part of the growth curve and assuming eternal \n exponential growth \n fitting a linear curve to the first part of the growth curve and assuming that take-up of the new technology is disappointing \n Rogers' bell curve \n Similarly in the later stages the opposite mistakes can be made relating to the possibilities of \n technology maturity \n and \n market saturation \n The \n technology adoption life cycle \n typically occurs in an S curve as modelled in \n diffusion of innovations \n theory This is because customers respond to new products in different ways \n Diffusion of innovations \n theory pioneered by \n Everett Rogers \n posits that people have different levels of readiness for adopting new \n innovations \n and that the characteristics of a product affect overall adoption Rogers classified individuals into five groups innovators early adopters early majority late majority and laggards In terms of the S curve innovators occupy 5% early adopters 5% early majority 34% late majority 34% and laggards 16% \n The four stages of technology life cycle are as follows \n Innovation stage This stage represents the birth of a new product material of process resulting from R&D activities In R&D laboratories new ideas are generated depending on gaining needs and knowledge factors Depending on the resource allocation and also the change element the time taken in the innovation stage as well as in the subsequent stages varies widely \n Syndication stage This stage represents the demonstration and commercialisation of a new technology such as product material or process with potential for immediate utilisation Many innovations are put on hold in R&D laboratories Only a very small percentage of these are commercialised Commercialisation of research outcomes depends on technical as well non-technical mostly economic factors \n Diffusion stage This represents the market penetration of a new technology through acceptance of the innovation by potential users of the technology But supply and demand side factors jointly influence the rate of diffusion \n Substitution stage This last stage represents the decline in the use and eventual extension of a technology due to replacement by another technology Many technical and non-technical factors influence the rate of substitution The time taken in the substitution stage depends on the market dynamics \n Licensing options \n Large corporations develop technology for their own benefit and not with the objective of licensing The tendency to license out technology only appears when there is a threat to the life of the TLC business gain as discussed later \n Licensing in the R&D phase \n There are always smaller firms \n SMEs \n who are inadequately situated to finance the development of innovative R&D in the post-research and early technology phases By sharing incipient technology under certain conditions substantial risk financing can come from third parties This is a form of quasi-licensing which takes different formats Even large corporates may not wish to bear all costs of development in areas of significant and high risk e g aircraft development and may seek means of spreading it to the stage that proof-of-concept is obtained \n In the case of small and medium firms entities such as \n venture capitalists \n 'angels' can enter the scene and help to materialize technologies Venture capitalists accept both the costs and uncertainties of R&D and that of market acceptance in reward for high returns when the technology proves itself Apart from finance they may provide networking management and marketing support Venture capital connotes financial as well as human capital \n Larger firms may opt for Joint R&D or work in a consortium for the early phase of development Such vehicles are called \n strategic alliances \n strategic partnerships \n With both venture capital funding and strategic research alliances when business gains begin to neutralize development costs the TLC crosses the X-axis the ownership of the technology starts to undergo change \n In the case of smaller firms venture capitalists help clients enter the stock market for obtaining substantially larger funds for development maturation of technology product promotion and to meet marketing costs A major route is through \n initial public offering \n IPO which invites risk funding by the public for potential high gain At the same time the IPOs enable venture capitalists to attempt to recover expenditures already incurred by them through part sale of the stock pre-allotted to them subsequent to the listing of the stock on the stock exchange When the IPO is fully subscribed the assisted enterprise becomes a corporation and can more easily obtain bank loans etc if needed \n Strategic alliance partners allied on research pursue separate paths of development with the incipient technology of common origin but pool their accomplishments through instruments such as 'cross-licensing' Generally contractual provisions among the members of the consortium allow a member to exercise the option of independent pursuit after joint consultation in which case the optee owns all subsequent development \n Licensing in the ascent phase \n The ascent stage of the technology usually refers to some point above Point A in the TLC diagram but actually it commences when the R&D portion of the TLC curve inflects only that the cashflow is negative and unremunerative to Point A The ascent is the strongest phase of the TLC because it is here that the technology is superior to alternatives and can command premium profit or gain The slope and duration of the ascent depends on competing technologies entering the domain although they may not be \n as successful \n in that period Strongly patented technology extends the duration period \n The TLC begins to flatten out the region shown as M when equivalent or challenging technologies come into the competitive space and begin to eat away marketshare \n Till this stage is reached the technology-owning firm would tend to exclusively enjoy its profitability preferring \n not \n to license it If an overseas opportunity does present itself the firm would prefer to set up a controlled subsidiary rather than license a third party \n Licensing in the maturity phase \n The maturity phase of the technology is a period of stable and remunerative income but its competitive viability can persist over the larger timeframe marked by its 'vital life' However there may be a tendency to license out the technology to third parties during this stage to lower risk of decline in profitability or competitivity and to expand financial opportunity \n The exercise of this option is generally inferior to seeking participatory exploitation in other words engagement in \n joint venture \n typically in regions where the technology would be in the \n ascent phase \n as say a developing country In addition to providing financial opportunity it allows the technology-owner a degree of control over its use Gain flows from the two streams of investment-based and royalty incomes Further the vital life of the technology is enhanced in such strategy \n Licensing in the decline phase \n After reaching a point such as D in the above diagram the earnings from the technology begin to decline rather rapidly To prolong the life cycle owners of technology might try to license it out at some point L when it can still be attractive to firms in other markets This then traces the lengthening path LL' Further since the decline is the result of competing rising technologies in this space licenses may be attracted to the general lower cost of the older technology than what prevailed during its vital life \n Licenses obtained in this phase are 'straight licenses' They are free of direct control from the owner of the technology as would otherwise apply say in the case of a joint-venture Further there may be fewer restrictions placed on the licensee in the employment of the technology \n The utility viability and thus the cost of straight-licenses depends on the estimated 'balance life' of the technology For instance should the key patent on the technology have expired or would expire in a short while the residual viability of the technology may be limited although balance life may be governed by other criteria such as \n knowhow \n which could have a longer life if properly protected \n It is important to note that the license has no way of knowing the stage at which the prime and competing technologies are on their TLCs \n It would of course be evident to competing licensor firms and to the originator from the growth saturation or decline of the profitability of their operations \n The license may however be able to approximate the stage by vigorously negotiating with the licensor and competitors to determine costs and licensing terms A lower cost or easier terms \n may \n imply a declining technology \n In any case access to technology in the decline phase is a large risk that the licensee accepts In a joint-venture this risk is substantially reduced by licensor sharing it Sometimes financial guarantees from the licensor may work to reduce such risk and can be negotiated \n There are instances when even though the technology declines to becoming a technique it may still contain important knowledge or experience which the licensee firm cannot learn of without help from the originator This is often the form that \n technical service \n and \n technical assistance \n contracts take encountered often in developing country contracts Alternatively consulting agencies may fill this role \n Technology development cycle \n According to the \n

Value is created through exchange and the relationships between roles Value networks operate in public agencies civil society in the enterprise institutional settings and all forms of organization Value networks advance innovation wealth \n social good \n and \n environmental \n well-being \n Clayton Christensen \n Christensen \n defines value network as \n \"The collection of upstream suppliers downstream \n channels \n to \n market \n and ancillary providers that support a common business model within an industry When would-be disruptors enter into existing value networks they must adapt their business models to conform to the value network and therefore fail at disruption because they become co-opted \" \n Fjeldstad and Stabells \n Fjeldstad and Stabell \n presents a framework for \"value configurations\" in which a \"value Network\" is one of three alternatives ways in which an organisation generates value the others being the \n value shop \n and value Chain \n F&S's value networks consists of these components \n A set of customers \n Some service the customers all use and enables interaction between the customers \n Some organization that provides the service \n A set of contracts that enables access to the service \n An obvious example of a value network is the network formed by phone users The phone company provides a service users enter a contract with the phone company and immediately has access to all the value network of other customers of the phone company \n Another less obvious example is a car insurance company The company provides car insurance The customers gains access to the roads and can do their thing and interact in various ways while being exposed to limited risk The insurance policies represent the contracts the internal processes of the insurance company the service provisioning \n Unfortunately F&S and Christensen's concepts both address the same issue the conceptual understanding of how a company understands itself and its value creation process but they are not identical Christensen's value networks address the relation between a company and its suppliers and the requirements posed by the customers and how these interact when defining what represents value in the product that is produced \n Fjeldstad & Stabell's value networks is a configuration which emphasize that the value being created is \n between customers \n when they interact \n facilitated \n by the value networks This represents a very different perspective from Christensen's but confusingly also one that is applicable in many of the same situations as Christensen's \n Normann and Ramirez' value constellations \n Normann and Ramirez argued \n as early as that in today's environment strategy is no longer a matter of positioning a fixed set of activities along a value chain According to them the focus today should be on the value creating system itself Where all stakeholders co-produce value Successful companies conceive of strategy as systematic social innovation With this article they laid a foundation for the Value Network to emerge as a mental model \n Verna Allee \n Verna Allee \n defines value networks \n as any web of relationships that generates both tangible and intangible value through complex dynamic exchanges between two or more individuals groups or organizations Any organization or group of organizations engaged in both tangible and intangible exchanges can be viewed as a value network whether private industry government or public sector \n Allee developed \n Value network analysis \n a whole systems mapping and analysis approach to understanding tangible and intangible value creation among participants in an enterprise system Revealing the hidden network patterns behind business processes can provide predictive intelligence for when workflow performance is at risk She believes \n value network analysis \n provides a standard way to define map and analyse the participants transactions and tangible and intangible deliverables that together form a value network Allee says value network analysis can lead to profound shifts in perception of problem situations and mobilise collective action to implement change \n Important terms and concepts \n Tangible value \n All exchanges of goods services or revenue including all transactions involving contracts invoices return receipt of orders request for proposals confirmations and payment are considered to be tangible value Products or services that generate revenue or are expected as part of a service are also included in the tangible value flow of goods services and revenue In government agencies these would be mandated activities In civil society organizations these would be formal commitments to provide resources or services \n Intangible value \n Two primary subcategories are included in intangible value knowledge and benefits Intangible knowledge exchanges include strategic information planning knowledge process knowledge technical know-how collaborative design and policy development which support the product and service tangible value network Intangible benefits are also considered favors that can be offered from one person to another Examples include offering political or emotional support to someone Another example of intangible value is when a research organization asks someone to volunteer their time and expertise to a project in exchange for the intangible benefit of prestige by affiliation \n All biological organisms including humans function in a self-organizing mode internally and externally That is the elements in our bodiesdown to individual cells and DNA moleculeswork together in order to sustain us However there is no central \"boss\" to control this dynamic activity Our relationships with other individuals also progress through the same circular free flowing process as we search for outcomes that are best for our well-being Under the right conditions these social exchanges can be extraordinarily altruistic Conversely they can also be quite self-centered and even violent It all depends on the context of the immediate environment and the people involved \n A non-linear approach \n Often value networks are considered to consist of groups of companies working together to produce and transport a product to the customer Relationships among customers of a single company are examples of how value networks can be found in any organization Companies can link their customers together by direct methods like the telephone or indirect methods like combining customer's resources together \n The purpose of value networks is to create the most benefit for the people involved in the network The intangible value of knowledge within these networks is just as important as a monetary value In order to succeed knowledge must be shared to create the best situations or opportunities Value networks are how ideas flow into the market and to the people that need to hear them \n Because value networks are instrumental in advancing business and institutional practices a \n value network analysis \n can be useful in a wide variety of business situations Some typical ones are listed below \n Relationship management \n Relationship management typically just focuses on managing information about customers suppliers and business partners A value network approach considers relationships as two-way value-creating interactions which focus on realizing value as well as providing value \n Business web and ecosystem development \n Resource deployment delivery market innovation knowledge sharing and time-to-market advantage are dependent on the quality coherence and vitality of the relevant value networks business webs and \n business ecosystems \n Fast-track complex process redesign \n Product and service offerings are constantly changing and so are the processes to innovate design manufacture and deliver them Multiple inter-dependent and concurrent processes are too complex for traditional process mapping but can be analyzed very quickly with the value network method \n Reconfiguring the organization \n Mergers acquisitions downsizing expansion to new markets new product groups new partners new roles and functions anytime relationships change value interactions and flows change too \n Supporting knowledge networks and communities of practice \n Understanding the transactional dynamics is vital for purposeful networks of all kinds including networks and communities focused on creating knowledge value A value network analysis helps \n communities of practice \n negotiate for resources and demonstrate their value to different groups within the organization \n Develop scorecards conduct ROI and cost/benefit analyses and drive decision making \n Because the value network approach addresses both financial and non-financial assets and exchanges it expands metrics and indexes beyond the lagging

the town but then moved on to \n the Cambridge School of Weston \n a private progressive school for 8th grade as well as his later years Even as a young child outside of the classroom one of Eric's favorite pastimes was to try to create and invent new things Much of his inspiration came from his father Arthur Robert von Hippel who was also a professor at MIT \n Education \n For his undergraduate degree Eric von Hippel attended Harvard College In an interview with Eric he cited that he chose Harvard over MIT for the opportunity to pursue Liberal Arts as he majored in Economics His decision to focus in Economics stemmed from his trials in Biology and History and finding that neither was particularly the right fit for him After pursuing several inventions post undergraduate Eric returned to school for his Masters in Mechanical Engineering at MIT From there he went on to start his own company worked at management consultant \n McKinsey and Co \n and eventually studied at \n Carnegie Mellon University \n for his Ph D in Innovation \n Degrees \n Hamburg University of Technology Ph D Hon \n Copenhagen Business School Ph D Hon \n Ludwig-Maximillians Universitt Mnchen Ph D Hon \n Carnegie Mellon University Ph D \n Massachusetts Institute of Technology S M \n Harvard College B A \n Major works \n Innovation by users and lead users \n User innovation \n is the idea that more users and consumers than suppliers are the innovators of new products Eric von Hippel was one of the first to notice this trend and explore it Products made by manufacturers are typically developed to meet a wide range of the needs of a wide range of people Therefore when a particular user experiences needs that are not yet felt by the majority of consumers they make the adjustments themselves to meet their own needs Often these ideas are then fed back to manufacturing companies from these users in the hope that the product will then be produced for them This process is called \"free revealing\" User innovation can be seen across a wide range of products from home cleaning equipment to medical devices In the field of scientific instruments Hippel's research has even found that user innovation is a dominant influence \n User innovation extends not only to tangible products but also to services Hippel found that eighty-five percent of individuals self-provided themselves with accounting and banking processes before banks offered this service \n More recently with \n Pedro Oliveira \n and colleagues studied the role of patients of \n chronic diseases \n and their caregivers in creating new solutions to help them cope with their health conditions They administered a survey to \n rare disease \n patients/caregivers and found that individuals 8% of the sample reported solutions that they personally find valuable and that are also evaluated as novel by expert medical evaluators If anything like this fraction of innovators holds for the overall population of hundreds of millions of people world-wide estimated to be afflicted by rare diseases patients and their caregivers may be a tremendous potential resource to improve management and care for many who are similarly afflicted \n An extension of user innovations is the idea of \n lead users \n These are the individuals who first feel the need for a product or service and create it for themselves Lead user identification is an essential method used by companies to identify the newest innovations in their product areas giving them crucial insight on the needs of their users \n Innovation toolkits \n On Eric von Hippel's website it is stated that innovation toolkits are used to organize and support information that is shared amongst various users and producers of projects \n In one of his papers entitled \"Perspective User toolkits for innovation \" Hippel describes how user toolkits can be used to help manufacturers and companies determine the users' need-related aspects of products and services The users are provided with \"user toolkits for innovation \" to help the manufacturer outsource tasks that would normally take much time and effort within the company One of the first areas that user toolkits have been used was in the design and manufacturing of custom integrated circuits \n In this field it was critical that manufacturers understood user needs because it could result in months of delays costing the company thousands of dollars LSI Logic produced a software design tool that its customers could use to design circuits themselves This move helped LSI grow to be one of the major players in the custom IC market and competitors were soon moving in the same direction \n \"Toolkits for user innovation are coordinated sets of \"user-friendly\" design tools that enable users to develop new product innovations for themselves The toolkits are not general purpose Rather they are specific to the design challenges of a specific field or sub field such as integrated circuit design or software product design \" \n Toolkits should have the following features \n Learning by trial-and-error \n An appropriate solution space \n A user-friendly toolkit \n Commonly used modules \n Result easily created by user \n Sticky information and its uses \n Sticky information is information that is expensive to obtain transmit and employ in a new location compared to where it originated \"We define the stickiness of a given unit of information in a given instance as the incremental expenditure required to transfer that unit of information to a specified locus in a form usable by a given information seeker When this cost is low information stickiness is low when it is high stickiness is high \" Eric von Hippel \n Eric von Hippel has worked to define how sticky information influences innovation and how to overcome stickiness when trying to develop a new technology Sticky information is often encountered when a manufacturers would like to know about how current users feel about their needs and if their needs are being met or not by current product lines However this information would be difficult to acquire for the manufacturer though it would be tremendously helpful in their pursuit of product innovation \n Information can be sticky for a number of reasons Much information that humans have is tacit and therefore is difficult to communicate when sharing information Additionally some technical information is composed of a very large number of parts Sometimes it is difficult to communicate all of these especially when some operating procedures or techniques are so routine a regular practitioner may forget to include such details \n The stickiness of a particular type of information can have influences on how advances are made in the field For example if a particular company holds much of the expertise and knowledge for a particular technology it will likely be difficult for another company to make advancements that originate from the original technology Innovations are more likely to occur in the original company This can also occur in a geographic manner Local information can also be sticky and innovations that help a particular area with a special problem are likely to come from that area as well \n Measurements of innovation and innovation indicators \n Researchers have not started quantifying user innovation until recently It is important that researchers are able to measure innovation and gather statistics so that policymakers can see the impact of user innovation on modern day technologies Research has shown that many of the innovative products produced by manufacturers were ideas stemmed off from \"lead users \" \n Eric von Hippel has written several papers regarding \"Measurements of Innovation\" and \"Innovation Indicators \" In one of his papers he discusses his work with Fred Gault to survey Canadian manufacturing plants to determine the prevalence of user innovation They were able to determine that \"About 20% of the user-innovators surveyed reported transferring their innovations to other users and/or equipment suppliers and the majority of these at least sometimes did so at no charge to recipients \" \n These types of innovation indicators will help the government and other researchers to see the impact of users on innovation \n Innovation strategies and lead user identification \n Eric von Hippel has focused on the following major areas of innovation strategies in his research \n Task partitioning \n Improvement of innovation processes \n Pyramiding \n Task partitioning refers to innovation projects that are partitioned into smaller tasks Hippel proposes that \"problem-solving inter-dependence among tasks can be predicted in many projects and can then be managed by strategies involving adjustment of the task specifications and/or reduction of the barriers to problem-solving interaction across selected or all task boundaries \" \n Hippel calls attention to the improvement of innovation processes with great detail He feels that the processes call for more scrutiny and that in turn \"their improvement can significantly affect the kinds of research problems that can be addressed the efficiency and speed with which R&D can be performed and the competitive positions of firms employing them \" \n In his published work Hippel considers it critical for market researchers to look for lead users \"users who are on the leading edge of each identified trend in terms of related new product and process and who expect to obtain a relatively high net benefit from solutions to those needs \" \n Pyramiding is a search process based upon the view that people with a strong interest in a topic or field tend to know people more expert than themselves von Hippel states that it can sometimes be hard to identify lead users or the next CEO of any given company and pyramiding can assist in this process \n The Sources of Innovation \n ISBN

As he has written \" when you're a child if you don't like what you have you make it yourself\" referring to the skateboards and scooters of past generations Children designed and produced these products for themselves because they were not available to them otherwise Hippel became very interested in this phenomenon and how it worked which guided his path to where he is today Hippel looks to the work of Nathan Rosenberg of Stanford University whose research looks at the economics of technological change and the economic role of science as well as economic history and development \n Professor Richard Nelson of Columbia University who focuses on the processes of long-run economic change with particular emphasis on technological advances \n As well as Professor \n Anne Carter \n of Brandeis who specializes in the fields of changing specialization of businesses and of workers economics of information technical change and technology transfer \n Hippel also sees Dr \n Nikolaus Franke \n of the \n Vienna University of Economics and Business \n as a great influence in the field of product innovation Franke heads an institute on lead user innovation methods and also focuses on market research \n Additional information \n In an interview with Eric von Hippel he stated that his favorite aspects of his job were research work and teaching and specifically working with doctoral students His own favorite teacher was a high school biology teacher whom Hippel describes as \"a wonderful guy \" who showed him amazing new things in a new light He has said his idol is \n Jean Piaget \n a psychologist and philosopher who focused on learning about the stages of children's lives from observations \n In this leisure time Hippel enjoys talking to people and spending time with his children His wife Jessie is an editor of scholarly books and journal articles and also a tennis player his daughter Christiana has a master's degree student in Public Health at Indiana University and the first recipient of the \n Ryan White \n Legacy Scholarship for her work in promoting sexual health and his son Eric James studies the Japanese language and culture independently The family has a cockatiel named Merlin \n When Eric von Hippel's daughter Christiana was young he often made up cat-related bedtime stories because cats were her favorite animal When she was fourteen and they were traveling they wrote these stories down and called them \"Christiana in Catlandia \" \n Future works \n Hippel hopes to measure how many users innovate and what types of people do this type of work He would like to show that most innovation is still user innovation He finds it interesting that in the United Kingdom some 8% million people of consumers modify the products they use He has also noted that hospitals have the right to develop and use ideas as long as they do not sell them and he would like to persuade the institutional review board to approve development in hospital use In this way doctors would do innovation first and then companies could harness the benefits of such innovation He has stressed that the number of consumers modifying products and thereby innovating outweighs the number of people doing this in companies \n Lead user \n Patient Innovation \n Private-collective model of innovation \n User innovation"},

Paradox \n Additional Paradoxes \n Outcomes \n Real-World Examples of Innovation Leadership \n Overview \n To have a clear understanding of what innovation leadership involves one must first understand the concept of \n innovation \n Although there is some controversy over how it can be defined through general consensus in the literature it can be described as novel ideas of viable products that are put into operation \n It includes three different stages which are all dynamic and iterative constant \n Idea Generation \n Evaluation \n Implementation \n The two types of innovation include exploratory innovation which involves generating brand new ideas and value-added innovation which involves modifying and improving ideas that already exist \n Ideas generated must be useful to be considered innovative Innovation should also not be confused with \n creativity \n which is merely the generation of a novel idea that may not necessarily be put into operationthough these words are sometimes used interchangeably in research literature when speaking about innovation leadership Innovation leadership is a complex concept as there is no single explanation or formula for a leader to follow to increase innovation As a result innovation leadership encompasses a variety of different activities actions and behaviors that interact to produce an innovative outcome \n Value-added Innovation \n Exploratory and value-added innovation require different leadership styles and behaviors to succeed \n Value-added innovation PwC involves refining and revising an existing product or service and typically requires minimal risk taking compared to exploratory innovation which often involves taking a large risk in this case it is most appropriate for a leader for innovation to adopt a transactional form of leadership \n This is because a transactional leadership style does not use open leadership behaviors such as encouraging employees to experiment and take risks but rather uses closed leadership behaviors that do not condone or reward risk-taking Companies whose innovation leaders use transactional leadership for value-added innovation purposes include Toyota Motor Co General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co \n examples of these companies value-added innovations such as making improvements on existing cars by making them faster more comfortable and getting better gas mileage \n Occasionally a value-added innovation may require a completely new way of thinking and possibly taking new risks An example of this scenario can be illustrated through Aspirin this was an existing product traditionally used as an analgesic to alleviate aches and pains but has been introduced into a new and different market by extending its uses to help prevent heart attack and reduce blot clot formation In this example the usage of an existing product was re-worked and introduced into a new market While an existing product is being changed and/or improved upon characterizing it as a value-added innovation outside-the-box thinking research and risk-taking are now required since it is being introduced into a new market In this case a transformational leadership style is a more appropriate style to use \n The innovation leader must gauge if and how much risk and radical thinking are involved in the value-added innovation to determine which leadership style to use in a situation The leader must be flexibleable to switch leadership behaviors when necessary \n Exploratory Innovation \n Exploratory innovation refers to the generation of novel ideas strategies and solutions through the use of strictly open behaviors exhibited most often by transformational leaders The foundation of exploratory innovation is characterized by search discovery experimentation and risk taking It is the organizations focus on generating new ideas products and strategies in contrast to exploitative innovation which focuses on building and extending already existing ideas Some studies have shown that explorative and exploitative innovation require different structures strategies processes capabilities and cultures \n See Innovative Organizational Climate/Culture Exploratory innovation requires flexibility opportunism adaptability and for leaders to provide intellectual stimulation to their subordinates \n In this approach to innovation the leadership style that is primarily used is transformational The behaviors exhibited are believed to achieve the desired creative outcome from employees through the application of individualized consideration charisma and inspirational motivation \n For example in one study of the innovation practices at AXA Insurance in Ireland the CEO John ONeil engaged in transformational leadership behaviors and introduced the MadHouse program that combined workers from different departments and levels of the organization to work together in a creative way The result of this experiment after six months was new business ideas for products and services \n Explorative and Value-added innovation are often referenced together but surprisingly little research shows an interaction between the two However there is an understanding that in some circumstances a balance must be attained to achieve superior employee performance \n For example not all novel ideas are implemented and may be resurrected later The organization may need to switch gears and adopt exploitative strategies to revise and refine the idea to match present needs \n Foundations of Innovation Leadership \n Innovation leadership has roots in \n path-goal theory \n and \n leader-member exchange theory \n Certain elements within an organization are also needed for innovation leadership to succeeded Wolfe \n as cited by Sarros Cooper & Santora \n has pointed out that one antecedent factor for innovation is \n organizational culture \n Likewise Isaksen Laver Ekvail & Britz \n concur that innovative endeavors fail without a supportive climate This antecedent of a supportive organizational culture/climate encompasses encouragement of creativity \n autonomy \n resources and pressures Additional foundational elements for innovation leadership include creative work a creative workforce and certain leader attributes \n Roots in Path-Goal Theory \n The basis of \n path-goal theory \n uses a similar view of leadership in that it advocates different types of leadership e g participative supportive behaviors much like innovation leadership does However it is contingent on employee and environmental factor to be effective \n The idea of a single leader using different leadership behaviors originated in path-goal theory and has been associated with the framework underlying innovation leadership which also allows the creation of a work environment conducive to innovative thinkingwhich is the cognitive process of generating novel and useful ideas \n Creating this type of work environment through innovation leadership involves open leadership behaviors that resemble some leader behaviors proposed by Path-goal theoryfor example upward influence and supportive/considerate behaviors \n In innovation leadership these behaviors encourage the creative team to generate as many novel ideas as possible and lead to evaluation and implementation of these ideas \n Roots in Leader-Member Exchange Theory \n Leader-member exchange theory \n LMX theory is another one of the building blocks of innovation leadership It follows the same idea as Path-goal theory and innovation leadership that multiple leadership styles are necessary in managing multiple subordinates but takes it a step further LMX involves adopting a unique leadership style for each employee Past studies indicate that LMX theory has been shown to have an effect on innovation \n Studies have also shown that leader-member exchange relationships can predict significant organizational and attitudinal variables including higher job satisfaction and higher job performance \n Basu and Green \n found that innovative behavior is related to the quality of the leader-member exchange where high quality exchanges include contributions from both the leader and the follower However in a study by Jean Lee \n only the loyalty aspect of LMX LMXL was shown to be related to innovativeness Leadership styles transformational positively related and transactional negatively related were found to have an effect on innovativeness \n Innovative Organizational Culture/Climate \n Some studies have shown evidence of organizational culture as the mediator of the relationship between transformational leadership and organizational innovation \n and performance \n In other words for transformational leadership to affect organizational innovation an organization must have a strong innovative culture in addition to a leader with a \n transformational leadership \n style \n Organizational culture refers to an organization's deep structure normative beliefs and shared behavioral expectations This culture is fairly constant and can influence interorganizational relations Climate refers to the way that individuals perceive the extent to which the organizational culture impacts them The two essentially are interrelated One proposed model for assessing a creative environment in organizations includes the following dimensions \n Encouragement of Creativity \n Encouragement of creativity is the most frequently mentioned dimension in the literature It operates at three major levels each level containing multiple aspects \n Conceptual Model Underlying Assessment of Perceptions of the Work Environment for Creativity \n Organizational Encouragement \n The first level is Organizational Encouragement This involves encouragement of risk-taking and idea generation from all levels of management fair and supportive evaluation of new ideas recognition and reward of creativity and collaborative idea flow across an organization Each of these are equally important aspects of organizational encouragement but the third aspect recognition and reward of creativity may have adverse effects if the sole purpose for engaging in an activity is to gain reward \n Supervisory Encouragement \n The second level Supervisory Encouragement highlights the roles of supervisors and project managers in goal clarity open interaction between supervisors and subordinates and supervisory support of a teams work and ideas This level of encouragement points to the concepts of transformational leadership and LMX that emphasise the importance of the interactions of supervisors and subordinates in innovative performance \n Work Group Encouragement \n The third level of encouragement is Work Group Encouragement Diversity in team members backgrounds and openness to ideas affects creativity because individuals are exposed to a variety of novel and unusual ideas and such exposure had been demonstrated to have a positive effect on creative thinking \n Autonomy \n Autonomy is believed to foster creativity since studies have revealed that individuals produce more creative work and experience increased intrinsic motivation when they have a sense of control and ownership over their work and ideas and they perceive themselves as having a choice in how their goals are accomplished whether those goals are given to them by their supervisor or chosen by themselves \n Resources \n Resources have been suggested to be directly related to creativity in organizations Individuals perceptions of the availability of resources may lead to increased beliefs of the likelihood that the ideas they generate have a possibility of reaching the implementation stage \n Pressures \n The little evidence that exists on the dimension of pressure suggests somewhat paradoxical influences Some degree of pressure could have a positive effect if the pressure originates from the challenging and intellectual nature of the task itself increasing intrinsic motivation However if the pressure experienced is perceived extreme it could counteract creativity Amabile et al \n identify two forms of pressure excessive workload pressure and challenge They suggest that the first should have a negative influence on creativity while the second should have a positive one \n Organizational Impediments to Creativity \n Although there has been little research on the work of environment factors that undermine creativity some research suggests that these impediments include internal strife conservatism and rigid formal management structures within organizations \n This dimension is seen as working against autonomy and tends to have an inverse effect as individuals may perceive a more controlling environment \n Creative Work \n Creative work can occur at any job but more specifically it can occur in jobs where there are complicated ill-defined problems requiring innovative solutions \n The fact that the creative problems are ill-defined makes the creative work uncertain and it may involve risky efforts \n It is also resource intensive demanding and time consuming work \n requiring high levels of motivation \n and often requires collaboration \n This type of work must also involve both novel idea generation and novel idea implementation \n and requires expertise on the part of the workforce \n Creative Workforce \n A creative workforce is needed for innovation leadership to be successful Creative people have expertise on the subject requiring innovation and tend to use work as a source of identity \n Because of this they are powerfully intrinsically motivated by professional achievement opportunities and recognition Creative workers are also commonly characterized as highly valuing their autonomy additional dispositional attributes include openness flexibility cognitive complexity self-confidence dominance and \n introversion \n The patterns of characteristics creative workers exhibit typically allow them to confidently explore alternative ideas under ambiguous conditions \n Leader Attributes/Characteristics \n Successful innovation leadership requires a leader with certain characteristics These include expertise in the domain creativity ability to carry out transformational leadership behaviors planning and sense-making and social skills \n Innovative leaders can be recruited and hired through professional networks and referrals or alternatively found through succession planning which involves identifying innovative leaders who are already working within the organization \n Types of Innovation Leadership Styles \n In addition to these foundations various \n styles play an important role in innovation leadership each of which are used at different stages of the innovation process or for different types of innovation value-added vs exploratory Frequently associated leadership styles include transformational leadership \n transactional leadership \n and Ambidextrous leadership \n The type of leadership most strongly associated with innovation is transformational leadership \n Key Activities of Innovation Leadership \n Idea Generation \n As mentioned above different leadership styles and behaviors may be more appropriate at different stages of the innovation process Current research supports the notion that in the idea generation process innovation leadership requires a leader to use a more transformational style of leadership \n During this stage a leader needs to promote a safe environment for employees/team members to voice novel ideas and original thinking as well as provide workers with the resources to do so effectively \n Research has also found that leaders who engage in unconventional behaviors associated with transformational leadership were seen as stronger role models and as a result increase creative performance in their subordinates For example the founders of Google have been known to wear capes and jump-shoes around the office \n thus inspiring more outside-the-box thinking in their employees bThese open leadership behaviors convey that unorthodox and unconventional ideas and behaviors are not only accepted but also encouraged \n Idea Evaluation and Implementation \n In addition to providing a climate for idea generation innovation leadership also requires leaders to ensure that the process of idea generation does not overshadow the evaluation and implementation processes During these phases of leadership leaders must support some ideas while discarding other ideas and put the supported ideas into production The role of the leader must shift away from a transformational style to a more transactional style of leadership which involves being more direct and critical toward the ideas generated A leader now needs to ensure that constructive discussions of innovative ideas are taking place among their subordinates This serves to evaluate the usefulness of each idea eliminate those that do not appear viable to the organization or goal and push the ones that do appear viable into the production phase The leader must adopt what are known as closed leadership behaviors to achieve this Instead of stimulating idea generation the leader must shift focus from generating new ideas toward fine-tuning existing ideas to achieve progress toward the goal and ultimately implement the idea This challenge of balancing differing leadership styles when appropriate is called the \n generator evaluator paradox \n It is important to consider the role of ambidextrous leadership since a leader must be able to switch between leadership roles and styles when necessary to successfully lead for innovation Paradoxes of innovation leadership are discussed below \n Innovation Leadership and Influence \n Depending on the type of leadership style that is adopted by the innovation leader the leader may have either a direct or indirect influence on your employees \n Direct Influences \n Direct forms of influence in leading innovation include \n providing creative input and idea suggestion to employees \n providing employees with clear and concrete goals \n allocating organizational resources i e research and development spending manpower for implementing ideas \n Indirect Influences \n Indirect influences get the same results without providing explicit guidance to employees These types of influences include \n establishing a supportive climate for creativity within the organization \n acting as a role model for innovative thinking \n providing employees with rewards and recognition for innovative thinking \n hiring and team composition i e putting together teams with specific skill sets needed for innovative thinking or hiring employees with creative personalities without planning what they work on \n Proposed Model for Innovation Leadership \n A proposed model for innovation leadership has been a multilevel process model of innovation \n which uses the direct and indirect leadership on the processes of innovation mentioned in the above section to promote the innovation process In the model indirect leadership influences affect the individual creativity generation phase and team creativity evaluation phase process Direct leadership influences affect the team creativity evaluation phase process and the organizational innovation process implementation phase The individual creativity generation phase box in the model represents the process of the individual generating the initial idea or ideas and proposing them to their team The team creativity evaluation phase box represents the process of the team taking that idea making alterations and fine-tuning it to the point of making prototypes formalized sketches or simulations The organizational innovation implementation box represents taking those \n prototypes \n sketches or simulations and testing evaluating and possibly mass-producing them \n Figure Model of direct and indirect leadership influences on the process of innovation \n Two very important key features of this model should be mentioned \n The three stages of innovation idea generation evaluation and implementation are not independent of one another \n The stages in the model should not be viewed in a lock-step fashion meaning that there are both backward and forward influences and activities affecting each of the three stages For example ideas are generated discussed and tested only to feed information back into the system starting the process from the beginning again \n The forward and backward arrows between individual creativity and team creativity the forward and backward arrows between team creativity and organizational innovation as well as the arrow from organizational innovation to individual creativity visually represent this key feature \n Paradoxes of Innovation Leadership \n Innovation leadership is complex as can be seen from the Hunter & Cushenbery model \n and often \n paradoxes \n emerge that require leaders to strike a delicate balance between two conflicting roles e g encouraging innovative ideas vs limiting innovative ideas to include only those that are most viable and useful to the organization A balance must be struck not only within the leader and their behaviors but between conflicting interests of involved parties as well These include conflicting interests between the leader and the employees/teams between leaders and situational/contextual factors and between the employees/teams and the organization Critical potential paradoxes that are often faced by leaders of innovation have been provided by Hunter Thoroughgood Meyer & Ligon \n Internal/Localized Paradox \n Internal/Localized paradoxes entail conflicting roles experienced within the leader \n Dual Expertise Paradox \n The Dual Expertise Paradox postulates that a leader must have or acquire domain expertise while at the same time obtaining the necessary leadership skills to manage his/her employees and resources \n Generation Evaluation Paradox \n The Generation Evaluation Paradox stipulates that a leader must encourage a supportive climate for the generation of new ideas and thinking outside-the-box while evaluating these ideas and realizing that not all creative ideas are useful and many may even fail while not being too critical and negative of those ideas \n Team-level Paradox \n Team-level paradoxes entail conflicting interests between the leader and the employees/teams \n Creative Personality Cohesion Paradox \n Creative Personality Cohesion Paradox is based on the research finding that creative workers generally highly value autonomy \n and as a result often prefer to work alone This paradox illustrates the difficulty leaders have in providing their employees with the autonomy they must be creative while fostering team cohesion or closeness to facilitate idea sharing A leader must also be careful not to encourage too much cohesion as it may discourage group members from disagreeing even constructively disagreeing with fellow group members in an effort not to offend them or rock the boat \n Vision Autonomy Paradox \n The Vision Autonomy Paradox highlights the dilemma a leader faces between providing structure and guidance to a team with respect to the vision of the goal while at the same time stepping back and providing the team with enough autonomy especially considering the fact that creative workers highly value autonomy When leading for innovation providing an overabundance of structure may result in a backlash from employees who feel their autonomy is being taken away from them \n Restriction Freedom Paradox \n The Restriction Freedom Paradox underscores that innovation leaders need to allow employees enough time to develop creative endeavors and provide the resources to do so At the same time the leader must take care to provide enough pressure that they are still motivated to complete the task \n and not provide too many resources that it has a deadening effect on creativity \n Situational Paradox \n Situational Paradoxes entail conflicting interests between leaders and the situations they face \n Intrinsic Extrinsic Paradox \n The Intrinsic Extrinsic Paradox holds that instead of providing more readily available extrinsic motivation tools such as bonuses and salary increases leaders must provide intrinsic motivation which generally comes from within the employee to their employees This paradox is based on findings that intrinsic motivation is a key factor in facilitating creativity \n and extrinsic motivators may either hinder creativity \n or have an unclear relationship with creativity \n Local Long-Term Paradox \n The Local Long-Term Paradox posits that leaders of innovation must maintain their innovative edge by keeping an eye out for and capitalizing on potential opportunities even at the risk of placing those ideas above or even eliminating ideas that he or she had previously inspired in their teams The leader must also be capable of developing teams that are flexible enough to be passionate about ideas that may have replaced their own idea that was facilitated inspired and supported by their leader This is where the paradox is most clearly visible \n Competition Collaboration Paradox \n The \n competition collaboration paradox \n involves a leader developing open external relationships with other organizations to discover potential innovation opportunities while ensuring the organizations emerging ideas are protected in a competitive environment \n Feedback Rigidity Paradox \n The \n feedback rigidity paradox \n involves leaders seeking out and using customer and client advice and feedback towards innovative endeavors to a certain extent while maintaining control of the vision and not letting the feedback dictate to themas clients and customers often criticize innovations early on \n Failure Success Paradox \n The Failure Success Paradox is the idea that innovation leaders must ensure a safe organizational culture that is willing to embrace risk and failure while at the same time making sure that the organization is also producing successful products and services despite embracing risk and errors \n Additional Paradoxes \n Additional paradoxes identified by Hunter et al that do not directly involve the leader but are worth mentioning are the paradoxes that occur between teams and the organization These include the Insularity Cohesion paradox the Champion Evaluator paradox and the Creativity Cost paradox \n Outcomes \n Outcomes of innovation leadership include inspiring employees to the create and implement novel ideas for products services and technologies In addition these novel ideas can also be used to solve problems within an organization What this illustrates is that innovation spurred by innovation leadership can be translated across various industries and can be used for a multitude of purposes \n Ultimately inspiring and initiating organizational innovation through innovation leadership can serve to advance the organization it to the next level \n Real-World Examples of Innovation Leadership \n Companies that use innovative leadership include 3M which lets employees work on a project of their choosing for 15% of their time \n Similarly Google allows employees one day a week to work on their own project \n Zappos employees are allowed to radically decorate their cubicle and are encouraged to laugh and have fun at work impromptu in-office

{"theme.id": 4, "title": "Induced innovation", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_innovation", "depth": 1, "text": "Induced innovation \n Induced innovation \n is a \n macroeconomic \n hypothesis \n first proposed in \n by \n J R Hicks \n in his work \n The Theory of Wages \n He proposed that \"a change in the relative prices of the factors of production is itself a spur to \n invention \n and to invention of a particular kinddirected to economizing the use of a factor which has become relatively expensive \" \n Considerable literature has been produced on this hypothesis which is often presented in terms of the effects of wage increases as an encouragement to labor-saving innovation The hypothesis has also been applied to viewing increases in \n energy \n costs as a motivation for a more rapid improvement in energy efficiency of goods than would normally occur \n Induced Innovation in Climate Change \n Induced innovation in agriculture \n Criticism to the induced innovation theory \n Induced Innovation in Climate Change \n A significant application of Hicks theory can be found in the field of climate change The exponential population growth occurred in the last century has drastically increased pressure on natural resources \n In order to have a sustainable future its imperative to modify global strategies on climate change and the induced innovation theory can aid to model these policies \n To calculate the \n human impact on the environment \n economists often use the I=P*A*T equation where I the impact variable for example energy consumption is the product of P the population A the affluence often embodied by GDPper capita and T the technology \n The technical coefficient represents the efficiency of the system in use for particular resource and expresses the average state of technology The decrease of \"T\" would indicate a gain in efficiency however I could still be growing or remaining stable if the improved technology is not sufficient to compensate the effect of an increase in \"P\" and \"A\" Therefore a reduction in I would always mean that pressure on resources has lightened but this might not always be the consequence of using resources more efficiently reducing T \n A fundamental issue of climate change is the excess of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere particularly CO2 as the result of an intensified economic activity Global GDP and CO2 emissions were growing at a corresponding rate in the until the 1970s \n It was then that oil prices have increased exponentially causing people to reduce its consumption \n According to Hicks theory a change in factor prices will stimulate development of technical innovation to reduce the use of the factor for which the price increased compared to other factors Following the oil shock significant investments were made in alternative sources of energy more efficient cars and heating systems to mitigate oil consumption As a result CO2 emissions started growing at a slower rate than GDP per capita Although petrol prices then dropped in the 1980s CO2 emissions have continued to grow more slowly than GDP This is an indication of a complete structural change in technology induced by the need to innovate \n Induced innovation in agriculture \n The development of agriculture is a fundamental part of the world economic growth Being able to meet the demand of an exponentially growing population can be a challenging task especially if we consider that one of the most important factors land remains fairly fixed \n According to the World Bank data less than 38% of the global surface area of a can be deemed usable for cultivation of crops or permanent pastures \n Expanding such a number can only be achieved by remediation of soil in a certain area in order to make the land fertile Needless to say that such an intervention requires a huge investment that can be amortized only in a long period of time Therefore to meet the increasing demand countries are forced to drastically increase the productivity of the land they dispose \n This is where induced innovation steps in \n In order to best explain how Hicks macroeconomic theory works let us consider a situation in which the demand for agricultural derived products increases as a result of either population growth or increased household income Theory states that in such a situation prices of inputs for which supply is inelastic will rise relative to prices of more elastic inputs Similarly if the supply of a particular input increases at a faster rate than the supply of other inputs the price of such input will decline relative to the price of the other factors of production used Ideally then farmers would be looking to replace or use less of the more inelastic and less responsive factors of production since they are the more expensive to use Therefore technical innovations that replace such inputs would guarantee less costs and hence more profits In other words when demand for their products increases farmers are lured by changes in relative prices to seek for technological alternatives that substitute the increasingly scarce factors of production \n Here is where the government has to intervene Clearly agricultural workers cant develop these innovations themselves and therefore demand that public research institutions develop new technologies that will then be transformed into modernized machinery that agricultural supply firms can sell to local farmers Scientists will now study the best solution to this problem and respond by making the appropriate technical development such that producers can efficiently substitute the abundant inputs for the increasingly scarce factors Ultimately this will lead to a reduction of farmers unit costs in the best possible way \n Criticism to the induced innovation theory \n Although some validity is still today attributed to John Hicks induced innovation theory different economists have critiqued his claims and developed the theory further \n There has been a massive difference of technical innovation between developed and underdeveloped countries LDCs are expected in the imminent future to industrialize and develop new technologies Economists believe that induced innovation can have a significant role in rural farming technical advancement However Danish economist Ester Boserup takes a slightly different position She believes that population growth would increase pressure on soil leading to improved soil management strategies aimed to raise productivity Contrarily to Hicks that would claim this is the consequence of an increase in factor prices Boserup believes growing population number and physical land availability are the main determinants of this change \n Similarly economist Skarstein takes a detached position from Hicks theory He argues that the induced innovation cant be an automatic outcome of an increase in factor prices Shifting factor prices would not lead to any innovations in factor saving techniques it will merely induce a change in techniques along the prevailing substitution line he argues This change will take place as soon as the relative factor prices shift When the change has taken place there is no further incentive to move inwards to a more efficient technology \n Salters sustained another contrasting view from Hicks theory He claimed that all firms are cost savers therefore under competitive equilibrium regime factors of production are paid its marginal value Consequently they will all have the same value leading to no particular stimulus to innovate to save a specific factor \n Creativity techniques \n International Innovation Index"},

Railway station in \n Bratislava \n Slovakia \n In \n economic theory \n inventions are one of the chief examples of \" \n positive externalities \n \" a beneficial side-effect that falls on those outside a transaction or activity One of the central concepts of economics is that externalities should be internalizedunless some of the benefits of this positive externality can be captured by the parties the parties are under-rewarded for their inventions and systematic under-rewarding leads to under-investment in activities that lead to inventions The \n patent \n system captures those \n positive externalities \n for the inventor or other patent owner so that the economy as a whole invests an optimum amount of resources in the invention process \n Invention vs innovation \n Innovation \n In the social sciences an innovation is something that is new better and has been adopted and proven to create positive value This is a key distinction from an invention which may not create positive value but furthers progress in a given area of development The theory for adoption of an innovation called \n diffusion of innovations \n considers the likelihood that an innovation is adopted and the taxonomy of persons likely to adopt it or spur its adoption This theory was first put forth by \n Everett Rogers \n Gabriel Tarde \n also dealt with the adoption of innovations in his \n Laws of Imitation \n Purposes of invention \n An invention can serve many purposes and does not necessarily create positive value These purposes might differ significantly and may change over time An invention or a further-developed version of it may serve purposes never envisioned by its original inventor s or by others living at the time of its original invention As an example consider all the kinds of plastic developed their many uses and the significant growth this material invention is still undergoing \n Invention as defined by patent law \n This section \n does not \n cite \n any \n sources \n Please help \n improve this section \n by \n adding citations to reliable sources \n Unsourced material may be challenged and \n removed \n May \n Learn how and when to remove this template message \n Patentability \n U S patent \n The term \n invention \n is also an important legal concept and central to patent law systems worldwide As is often the case for legal concepts its legal meaning is slightly different from common usage of the word Additionally the \n legal \n concept of invention is quite different in American and European patent law \n In Europe the first test a patent application must pass is \"Is this an invention?\" If it is subsequent questions are whether it is new and sufficiently inventive The implicationcounter-intuitivelyis that a legal invention is not inherently novel Whether a patent application relates to an invention is governed by Article of the European Patent Convention that excludes e g discoveries \n as such \n and software \n as such \n The EPO Boards of Appeal decided that the technical character of an application is decisive for it to represent an invention following an age-old Italians and German tradition British courts don't agree with this interpretation Following a Australian decision \"NRDC\" they believe that it is not possible to grasp the invention concept in a single rule A British court once stated that the technical character test implies a \" restatement of the problem in more imprecise terminology \" \n In the United States all patent applications are considered inventions The statute explicitly says that the American invention concept includes discoveries USC a contrary to the European invention concept The European invention concept corresponds to the American \"patentable subject matter\" concept the first test a patent application is submitted to While the statute USC virtually poses no limits to patenting whatsoever courts have decided in binding precedents that abstract ideas natural phenomena and laws of nature are not patentable Various attempts were made to substantiate the \"abstract idea\" test which suffers from abstractness itself but eventually none of them was successful The last attempt so far was the \"machine or transformation\" test but the U S Supreme Court decided in that it is merely an indication at best \n Invention in the arts \n Invention has a long and important history in \n the arts \n Inventive thinking has always played a vital role in the \n creative process \n While some inventions in the arts are \n patentable \n others are not because they cannot fulfill the strict requirements governments have established for granting them see \n patent \n Some inventions in art include the \n Collage \n and construction invented by

{"theme.id": 4, "title": "Technological innovation system", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_innovation_system", "depth": 1, "text": "Technological innovation system \n The \n technological innovation system \n is a concept developed within the scientific field of \n innovation \n studies which serves to explain the nature and rate of \n technological change \n A Technological Innovation System can be defined as a dynamic network of agents interacting in a specific economic/industrial area under a particular institutional infrastructure and involved in the generation diffusion and utilization of technology \n The approach may be applied to at least three levels of analysis to a \n technology \n in the sense of a knowledge field to a \n product \n or an artifact or to a set of related products and \n artifacts aimed at satisfying a particular societal function \n With respect to the latter the approach has especially proven itself in explaining why and how sustainable energy technologies have developed and diffused into a society or have failed to do so \n Background \n Structures \n Dynamics \n Seven system functions \n Cumulative causation \n Acquiring new technologies and capabilities \n Notes \n Further reading \n Background \n The concept of a technological innovation system was introduced as part of a wider theoretical school called the \n innovation system \n approach The central idea behind this approach is that determinants of technological change are not only to be found in individual firms or in research institutes but also in a broad societal structure in which firms as well as knowledge institutes are embedded \n Since the 1980s innovation system studies have pointed out the influence of societal structures on technological change and indirectly on long-term economic growth within nations sectors or technological fields \n The purpose of analyzing a Technological Innovation System is to analyze and evaluate the development of a particular technological field in terms of the structures and processes that support or hamper it Besides its particular focus there are two more analytical features that set the Technological Innovation System approach apart from other innovation system approaches \n Firstly the Technological Innovation System concept emphasizes that stimulating knowledge flows is not sufficient to induce technological change and economic performance There is a need to exploit this knowledge in order to create new business opportunities This stresses the importance of individuals as sources of innovation something which is sometimes overseen in the more macro-oriented nationally or sectorally oriented innovation system approaches \n Secondly the Technological Innovation System approach often focuses on system dynamics \n The focus on entrepreneurial action has encouraged scholars to consider a Technological Innovation System as something to be built up over time This was already put forward by Carlsson and Stankiewicz \n T echnological Innovation Systems are defined in terms of knowledge/competence flows rather than flows of ordinary goods and services They consist of dynamic knowledge and competence networks In the presence of an entrepreneur and sufficient critical mass such networks can be transformed into development blocks i e synergistic clusters of firms and technologies within an industry or a group of industries \n This means that a Technological Innovation System may be analyzed in terms of its system components and/or in terms of its dynamics Both perspectives will be explained below \n Structures \n The system components of a Technological Innovation System are called structures These represent the static aspect of the system as they are relatively stable over time Three basic categories are distinguished \n Actors \n Actors involve organizations contributing to a technology as a developer or adopter or indirectly as a regulator financier etc It is the actors of a Technological Innovation System that through choices and actions actually generate diffuse and utilize technologies The potential variety of relevant actors is enormous ranging from private actors to public actors and from technology developers to technology adopters The development of a Technological Innovation System will depend on the interrelations between all these actors For example entrepreneurs are unlikely to start investing in their businesses if governments are unwilling to support them financially Visa-verse governments have no clue where financial support is necessary if entrepreneurs do not provide them with the information and the arguments they need to legitimate policy support \n Institutions \n Institutional structures are at the core of the innovation system concept \n It is common to consider institutions as the rules of the game in a society or more formally the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction \n A distinction can be made between formal institutions and informal institutions with formal institutions being the rules that are codified and enforced by some authority and informal institutions being more tacit and organically shaped by the collective interaction of actors Informal institutions can be normative or cognitive The normative rules are social norms and values with moral significance whereas cognitive rules can be regarded as collective mind frames or social paradigms \n Examples of formal institutions are government laws and policy decisions firm directives or contracts also belong to this category An example of a normative rule is the responsibility felt by a company to prevent or clean up waste Examples of cognitive rules are search heuristics or problem-solving routines They also involve dominant visions and expectations held by the actors \n Technological factors \n Technological structures consist of artefacts and the technological infrastructures in which they are integrated They also involve the techno-economic workings of such artefacts including costs safety reliability These features are crucial for understanding the feedback mechanisms between technological change and institutional change For example if R&D subsidy schemes supporting technology development should result in improvements with regard to the safety and reliability of applications this would pave the way for more elaborate support schemes including practical demonstrations These may in turn benefit technological improvements even more It should however be noted here that the importance of technological features has often been neglected by scholars \n The structural factors are merely the elements that make up the system In an actual system these factors are all linked to each other If they form dense configurations they are called networks An example would be a coalition of firms jointly working on the application of a fuel cell guided by a set of problem-solving routines and supported by a subsidy program Likewise industry associations research communities policy networks user-supplier relations etc are all examples of networks \n An analysis of structures typically yields insight into systemic features - complementarities and conflicts - that constitute drivers and barriers for technology diffusion at a certain moment or within a given period in time \n Dynamics \n Structures involve elements that are relatively stable over time Nevertheless for many technologies especially newly emerging ones these structures are not yet fully in place For this reason mostly the scholars have recently enriched the literature on Technological Innovation Systems with studies that focus on the build-up of structures over time The central idea of this approach is to consider all activities that contribute to the development diffusion and use of innovations as system functions \n These system functions are to be understood as types of activities that influence the build-up of a Technological Innovation System Each system function may be fulfilled in a variety of ways The premise is that in order to properly develop the system should positively fulfil all system functions Various lists of system functions have been constructed Authors like Bergek et al \n Hekkert et al \n Negro \n and Suurs \n give useful overviews These lists show much overlap and differences reside mostly in the particular way of clustering activities An example of such a list is provided below \n Note that it is also possible that activities negatively contribute to a system function These negative contributions imply a partial breakdown of the system In particular domestic instability has been shown to exert downward pressure on innovation systems while international threats and national security alliances have a significantly positive effect on national innovative performance \n Seven system functions \n As an example the seven system functions defined by Hekkert are explained here \n F1 Entrepreneurial activities \n The classic role of the entrepreneur is to translate knowledge into business opportunities and eventually innovations The entrepreneur does this by performing market-oriented experiments that establish change both to the emerging technology and to the institutions that surround it The Entrepreneurial Activities involve projects aimed to prove the usefulness of the emerging technology in a practical and/or commercial environment Such projects typically take the form of experiments and demonstrations \n F2 Knowledge development \n The Knowledge Development function involves learning activities mostly on the emerging technology but also on markets networks users etc There are various types of learning activities the most important categories being learning-by-searching and learning-by-doing The former concerns \n R&D \n activities in basic science whereas the latter involves learning activities in a practical context for example in the form of laboratory experiments or adoption trials \n F3 Knowledge diffusion / knowledge exchange through networks \n The characteristic organization structure of a Technological Innovation System is that of the network The primary function of networks is to facilitate the exchange of knowledge between all the actors involved in it Knowledge Diffusion activities involve partnerships between actors for example technology developers but also meetings like workshops and conferences The important role of Knowledge Diffusion stems from Lundvalls notion of interactive learning as the raison-dtre of any innovation system \n The innovation system approach stresses that innovation happens only where actors of different backgrounds interact A special form of interactive learning is learning-by-using which involves learning activities based on the experience of users of technological innovations for example through user-producer interactions \n F4 Guidance of the search \n The Guidance of the Search function refers to activities that shape the needs requirements and expectations of actors with respect to their further support of the emerging technology Guidance of the Search refers to individual choices related to the technology but it may also take the form of hard institutions for example policy targets It also refers to promises and expectations as expressed by various actors in the community Guidance of the Search can be positive or negative A positive Guidance of the Search means a convergence of positive signals - expectations promises policy directives - in a particular direction of technology development If negative there will be a digression or even worse a rejection of development altogether This convergence is important since usually various technological options exist within an emerging technological field all of which require investments in order to develop further Since resources are usually limited it is important that specific foci are chosen After all without any focus there will be a dilution of resources preventing all options from prospering On the other hand too much focus may result in the loss of variety A healthy Technological Innovation System will strike a balance between creating and reducing variety \n F5 Market formation \n Emerging technologies cannot be expected to compete with incumbent technologies In order to stimulate innovation it is usually necessary to create artificial niche markets The Market Formation function involves activities that contribute to the creation of a demand for the emerging technology for example by financially supporting the use of the emerging technology or by taxing the use of competing technologies Market Formation is especially important in the field of sustainable energy technologies since in this case there usually is a strong normative legitimation for the intervention in market dynamics \n F6 Resource mobilization \n Resource Mobilization refers to the allocation of financial material and human capital The access to such capital factors is necessary for all other developments Typical activities involved in this system function are investments and subsidies They can also involve the deployment of generic infrastructures such as educational systems large R&D facilities or refueling infrastructures In some cases the mobilization of natural resources such as biomass oil or natural gas is important as well The Resource Mobilization function represents a basic economic variable Its importance is obvious an emerging technology cannot be supported in any way if there are no financial or natural means or if there are no actors present with the right skills and competences \n F7 Support from advocacy coalitions \n The rise of an emerging technology often leads to resistance from actors with interests in the incumbent energy system In order for a Technological Innovation System to develop other actors must counteract this inertia This can be done by urging authorities to reorganize the institutional configuration of the system The Support from Advocacy Coalitions function involves political lobbies and advice activities on behalf of interest groups This system function may be regarded as a special form of Guidance of the Search After all lobbies and advices are pleas in favor of particular technologies The essential feature which sets this category apart is that advocacy coalitions do not have the power like for example governments to change formal institutions directly Instead they employ the power of persuasion The notion of the advocacy coalition is based on the work of Sabatier who introduced the idea within the context of political science \n The concept stresses the idea that structural change within a system is the outcome of competing interest groups each representing a separate system of values and ideas The outcome is determined by political power \n Cumulative causation \n Since Carlsson and Stankiewicz introduced the concept of a Technological Innovation System an increasing number of scholars have started focusing on dynamics A recurring theme within their studies has been the notion of cumulative causation closely related to the idea of a \n virtuous circle \n or \n vicious circle \n by \n Gunnar Myrdal \n In this context cumulative causation is the phenomenon that the build-up of a Technological Innovation System accelerates due to system functions interacting and reinforcing each other over time For example the successful realization of a research project contributing to Knowledge Development may result in high expectations contributing to Guidance of the Search among policy makers which may subsequently trigger the start-up of a subsidy program contributing to Resource Mobilization which induces even more research activities Knowledge Development Guidance of the Search etc System functions may also reinforce each other downwards In that case interactions result in conflicting developments or a vicious circle! Recently scholars have increasingly paid attention to the question of how cumulative causation may be established often with a particular focus on the development of sustainable energy technologies \n Acquiring new technologies and capabilities \n To improve competitiveness and retain sustainability firms require new technologies and capabilities In this age of rapid innovation and complexity it is challenging for the firms to develop internally and remain competitive at the same time Merger acquisition and alliance are some of the ways to achieve this but the primary driver is the desire to obtain valuable resources Many acquisitions failed to achieve their objectives and resulted in poor performance because of improper implementation \n Improper documentation and changing implicit knowledge makes it difficult to share information during acquisition \n For acquired firm symbolic and cultural independence which is the base of technology and capabilities are more important than administrative independence \n Detailed knowledge exchange and integrations are difficult when the acquired firm is large and high performing \n Management of executives from acquired firm is critical in terms of promotions and pay incentives to utilize their talent and value their expertise \n Transfer of technologies and capabilities are most difficult task to manage because of complications of acquisition implementation The risk of losing implicit knowledge is always associated with the fast pace acquisition \n Preservation of tacit knowledge employees and literature are always delicate during and after acquisition Strategic management of all these resources is a very important factor for a successful acquisition \n Increase in acquisitions in our global business environment has pushed us to evaluate the key stake holders of acquisition very carefully before implementation It is imperative for the acquirer to understand this relationship and apply it to its advantage Retention is only possible when resources are exchanged and managed without affecting their independence \n Relational capital \n Technological transitions"},

Benefits of Community of Innovation \n Organizational Ambidexterity \n Nurturing Communities of Innovation \n Interest in the practicality and concept of Communities of Innovation \n Overview \n Origin \n Coakes and Smith define \n Communities of Innovation \n CoI \n as a form of \n Communities of Practice \n that are dedicated to the support of \n innovation \n They suggest that CoI can be formed from champions of innovation and their \n social network \n and that CoI are safe places for the creation and support of innovatory ideas \n COI are groups made up of motivated individuals working together towards a common goal not because of orders from their superiors but because they are convinced of their common cause \n Development \n Communities of Creation \n Sawhney and Prandelli proposed the model of Communities of Creation as a new governance mechanism for managing knowledge found in different companies for the purpose of innovation Intellectual property rights are considered to be owned by the entire community although the community is governed by a central firm which acts as the sponsor and defines the ground rules for participation This model lies between the closed hierarchical model and the open market-based model \n Communities of Innovation compared to Communities of Practice \n These are Communities that take total financial administrative and operational control over the development of their communities Democratically elected and answerable to the whole community It is simply an extension of the community saving societies that have existed for centuries The prime objective is sustainable environmental and social development controlled by the skills and finance available It provides employment improves the future prospects for all participants and their children and injects a sense of pride and achievement Using locally available materials linked to new environmentally friendly cost effective construction materials will produce affordable housing schools and roads \n The Aga Khan Foundation is focused on reducing rural poverty particularly in resource-poor degraded or remote environments The Aga Khan Foundation created the model of participatory rural development The model of participatory rural development combines a set of common development principles with the flexibility to respond to specific contexts and needs Programmes typically link elements such as rural savings and credit natural resource management productive infrastructure development increased agricultural productivity and human skills development with a central concern for community-level participation and decision-making The ultimate goal is to enable community members to make informed choices from a range of appropriate options for sustainable and equitable development \n An example of something that uses this model of participatory rural development and attempts to enact Communities of Innovation is Aggrebind a soil stabilizer AggreBind is a \"unique environmentally friendly cross-linked water based styrene acrylic polymer with proprietary tracers AggreBind is available in a wide range of colors to produce roads from insitu materials and for the manufacturing of blocks bricks and pavers for buildings and homes without using any cement \" \n AggreBind deliberately focuses on marketing its product for use in rural communities giving the inhabitants of these regions the tools to utilize AggreBind as a building material and create a green self-sustainable better place to live \n Examples of Communities of Innovation \n The COI that developed Linux \n Traditionally the company is the most efficient mean of managing knowledge belonging to different people The primary \n motivation \n is job security career advancement and recognition Lee and Cole argue for a \n community structure \n for knowledge creation that crosses firms boundaries \n To substantiate their argument they put forth the case of how thousands of talented volunteers dispersed across organizational and geographical boundaries collaborate via the \n Internet \n to produce a knowledge-intensive \n innovative \n product of high \n quality \n the \n Linux \n kernel Lee and Cole p The Linux community has proved to be a very efficient mean of managing knowledge belonging to different people The primary \n motivation \n is value system recognition and potential career advancement or hop Lee and Cole argue that research on \n knowledge management \n has to date focused on \n hierarchy \n and therefore has not adequately addressed the mobilization of \n distributed knowledge \n knowledge that is dispersed among many people They note that as illustrated by the \n Linux \n case the advent of the Internet and \n Web-based technologies \n has enabled specialized communities to convene interact and share \n resources \n extensively via electronic interfaces even across firms boundaries Lee and Cole p People are able to contribute effectively outside their working hours \n coordination \n of the work including \n feedback \n is possible even when people are working from different locations The \n catchment area \n is therefore much larger and the \n critical mass \n of software engineers required to develop and maintain the Linux project was therefore achievable \n Benefits of Community of Innovation \n Organizational Ambidexterity \n Successful COIs increase innovations within an organization They therefore have the potential to contribute to \n organizational ambidexterity \n which refers to the organizations dual capabilities of managing current business and being flexible and adaptable to meet future changes and demands \n Nurturing Communities of Innovation \n This section is empty \n You

term promoted by \n Henry Chesbrough \n adjunct professor and faculty director of the Center for Open Innovation at the Haas School of Business at the University of California \n in a book of the same name \n though the idea and discussion about some consequences especially the interfirm cooperation in R&D date as far back as the 1960s \n The term was originally referred to as \"a paradigm that assumes that firms can and should use external ideas as well as internal ideas and internal and external paths to market as the firms look to advance their technology\" \n More recently it is defined as \"a distributed innovation process based on purposively managed knowledge flows across organizational boundaries using pecuniary and non-pecuniary mechanisms in line with the organization's business model\" \n The boundaries between a firm and its environment have become more permeable innovations can easily transfer inward and outward \n The concept is also related to \n user innovation \n cumulative innovation \n know-how trading \n mass innovation \n crowdsourced innovation \n and distributed innovation \n The central idea behind open innovation is that in a world of widely distributed knowledge companies cannot afford to rely entirely on their own research but should instead buy or license processes or inventions i e patents from other companies In addition internal inventions not being used in a firm's business should be taken outside the company e g through licensing joint ventures or \n spin-offs \n The open innovation paradigm can be interpreted to go beyond just using external sources of innovation such as customers rival companies and academic institutions and can be as much a change in the use management and employment of \n intellectual property \n as it is in the technical and research driven generation of intellectual property In this sense it is understood as the systematic encouragement and exploration of a wide range of internal and external sources for innovative opportunities the integration of this exploration with firm capabilities and resources and the exploitation of these opportunities through multiple channels \n Advantages \n Disadvantages \n Models \n Government Driven \n Product platforming \n Idea competitions \n Customer immersion \n Collaborative product design and development \n Innovation networks \n In science \n Versus closed innovation \n Terminology \n Versus open source \n Advantages \n Open innovation offers several benefits to companies operating on a program of global collaboration \n Reduced cost of conducting research and development \n Potential for improvement in development productivity \n Incorporation of customers early in the development process \n Increase in accuracy for market research and customer targeting \n Potential for synergism between internal and external innovations \n Potential for viral marketing \n Disadvantages \n Implementing a model of open innovation is naturally associated with a number of risks and challenges including \n Possibility of revealing information not intended for sharing \n Potential for the hosting organization to lose their \n competitive advantage \n as a consequence of revealing intellectual property \n Increased complexity of controlling innovation and regulating how contributors affect a project \n Devising a means to properly identify and incorporate external innovation \n Realigning innovation strategies to extend beyond the firm in order to maximize the return from external innovation \n Models \n Government Driven \n In the UK the Knowledge Transfer Partnerships KTP is a funding mechanism encouraging the partnership between a firm and a knowledge-based partner \n A KTP is a collaboration program between a knowledge-based partner i e a research institution a company partner and one or more associates i e recently qualified persons such as graduates KTP initiatives aim to deliver significant improvement in business partners profitability as a direct result of the partnership through enhanced quality and operations increased sales and access to new markets At the end of their KTP project the three actors involved have to prepare a final report that describes KTP initiative supported the achievement of the projects innovation goals \n Product platforming \n This approach involves developing and introducing a partially completed product for the purpose of providing a framework or tool-kit for contributors to access customize and exploit The goal is for the contributors to extend the platform product's functionality while increasing the overall value of the product for everyone involved \n Readily available software frameworks such as a \n software development kit \n SDK or an \n application programming interface \n API are common examples of product platforms This approach is common in markets with strong \n network effects \n where demand for the product implementing the framework such as a mobile phone or an online application increases with the number of developers that are attracted to use the platform tool-kit The high scalability of platforming often results in an increased complexity of administration and quality assurance \n Idea competitions \n This model entails implementing a system that encourages competitiveness among contributors by rewarding successful submissions Developer competitions such as \n hackathon \n events fall under this category of open innovation This method provides organizations with inexpensive access to a large quantity of innovative ideas while also providing a deeper insight into the needs of their customers and contributors \n Customer immersion \n While mostly oriented toward the end of the product development cycle this technique involves extensive customer interaction through employees of the host organization Companies are thus able to accurately incorporate customer input while also allowing them to be more closely involved in the design process and product management cycle \n Collaborative product design and development \n Similarly to product platforming an organization incorporates their contributors into the development of the product This differs from platforming in the sense that in addition to the provision of the framework on which contributors develop the hosting organization still controls and maintains the eventual products developed in collaboration with their contributors This method gives organizations more control by ensuring that the correct product is developed as fast as possible while reducing the overall cost of development \n Dr \n Henry Chesbrough \n recently supported this model for open innovation in the optics and photonics industry \n Innovation networks \n Similarly to idea competitions an organization leverages a network of contributors in the design process by offering a reward in the form of an \n incentive \n The difference relates to the fact that the network of contributors are used to develop solutions to identified problems within the development process as opposed to new products \n Emphasis needs to be placed on assessing organisational capabilities to ensure value creation in open innovation \n In science \n In \n Austria \n the \n Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft \n started a project named \" \n Tell us! \n \" about mental health issues and used the concept of open innovation to \n crowdsource \n research questions \n The institute also launched the first \" \n Lab for Open Innovation in Science \n \" to teach selected scientists the concept of open innovation over the course of one year On Facebook the \n Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft \n informs about the lab the participants and teachers and on news on open innovation in \n science \n Versus closed innovation \n The paradigm of \n closed innovation \n holds that successful innovation requires control Particularly a company should control the generation of their own ideas as well as production marketing distribution servicing financing and supporting What drove this idea is that in the early twentieth century academic and government institutions were not involved in the commercial application of science As a result it was left up to other corporations to take the \n new product development \n cycle into their own hands There just was not the time to wait for the scientific community to become more involved in the practical application of science There also was not enough time to wait for other companies to start producing some of the components that were required in their final product These companies became relatively self-sufficient with little communication directed outwards to other companies or universities \n Throughout the years several factors emerged that paved the way for open innovation paradigms \n The increasing availability and mobility of skilled workers \n The growth of the venture capital market \n External options for ideas sitting on the shelf \n The increasing capability of external suppliers \n These four factors have resulted in a new market of knowledge Knowledge is not anymore proprietary to the company It resides in employees suppliers customers competitors and universities If companies do not use the knowledge they have inside someone else will Innovation can be generated either by means of closed innovation or by open innovation paradigms \n There is an ongoing debate on which paradigm will dominate in the future \n Terminology \n Modern research of open innovation is divided into two groups which have several names but are similar in their essence discovery and exploitation outside-in and inside-out inbound and outbound The common factor for different names is the direction of innovation whether from outside the company in or from inside the company out \n Revealing non-pecuniary outbound innovation \n This type of open innovation is when a company freely shares its resources with other partners without an instant financial reward The source of profit has an indirect nature and is manifested as a new type of business model \n Selling pecuniary outbound innovation \n In this type of open innovation a company commercialises its inventions and technology through selling or licensing technology to a third party \n Sourcing non-pecuniary inbound innovation \n This type of open innovation is when companies use freely available external knowledge as a source of internal innovation Before starting any internal R&D project a company should monitor the external environment in search for existing solutions thus in this case internal R&D become tools to absorb external ideas for internal needs \n Acquiring pecuniary inbound innovation \n In this type of open innovation a company is buying innovation from its partners through licensing or other procedures involving monetary reward for external knowledge \n Versus open source \n Open source \n and open innovation might conflict on patent issues This conflict is particularly apparent when considering technologies that may save lives or other \n open-source-appropriate technologies \n that may assist in \n poverty \n reduction or \n sustainable development \n However \n open source \n and open innovation are not mutually exclusive because participating companies can donate their patents to an independent organization put them in a common pool or grant unlimited license use to anybody Hence some open-source initiatives can merge these two concepts this is the case for instance for IBM with its \n Eclipse \n platform which the company presents as a case of open innovation where competing companies are invited to cooperate inside an open-innovation network \n In \n Eric Raymond \n writing about the open-source software movement coined the term \n the cathedral and the bazaar \n The cathedral represented the conventional method of employing a group of experts to design and develop software though it could apply to any large-scale creative or innovative work The bazaar represented the open-source approach This idea has been amplified by a lot of people notably \n Don Tapscott \n and \n Anthony D Williams \n in their book \n Wikinomics \n Eric Raymond himself is also quoted as saying that 'one cannot code from the ground up in bazaar style One can test debug and improve in bazaar style but it would be very hard to originate a project in bazaar mode' In the same vein Raymond is also quoted as saying 'The individual wizard is where successful bazaar projects generally start' \n Open-source specialist \n Franois Letellier \n advocates that open source or \n free software \n is a natural way of innovation in the software industry and that it is an exemplary and very effective form of open innovation with open-source projects/communities act as innovation intermediaries \n Discovery Network \n Ideas bank \n Innovation \n Innovation intermediary

apersonal reflection or opinion essay \n that states a Wikipedia editor's personal feelings about a topic \n Please \n help improve it \n by rewriting it in an \n encyclopedic style \n January \n Learn how and when to remove this template message \n There are a number of theories attempting to address \n technology \n which tend to be associated with the disciplines of \n science and technology studies \n STS and \n communication studies \n Most generally the theories attempt to address the relationship between \n technology and society \n and prompt questions about \n agency \n determinism/autonomy \n and \n teleonomy \n If forced one might categorize them into social and group theories Additionally one might distinguish between descriptive and critical theories \n Descriptive \n theories attempt to address the definition and substance of technology the ways it has emerged changed and its relation to the human/social sphere More substantively it addresses the extent of which technology is autonomous and how much force it has in determining human practice or social structure \n Critical \n theories of technology \n often take a descriptive theory as their basis and articulate concerns examining what way the relationship can be changed The authors mentioned in this article are those that have some concern with technology or media though they often borrow from one another and of course build upon seminal theorists that preceded them \n Social theories \n Descriptive approaches \n Critical approaches \n Other stances \n Group theories \n Analytic theories \n Social theories \n Descriptive approaches \n Social construction of technology \n SCOT argues that technology does not determine human action but that human action shapes technology Key concepts include \n interpretive flexibility \n \"Technological artifacts are culturally constructed and interpreted By this we mean not only that there is flexibility in how people think of or interpret artifacts but also that there is flexibility in how artifacts are designed \" \n Relevant social group \n shares a particular set of meanings about an artifact \n ' \n Closure' \n and stabilization \n when the relevant social group has reached a consensus \n Wider context \n \"the sociocultural and political situation of a social group shapes its norms and values which in turn influence the meaning given to an artifact\" \n Key authors include MacKensie and Wajcman \n Actor-network theory \n ANT posits a heterogeneous network of humans and non-humans as equal interrelated actors It strives for impartiality in the description of human and nonhuman actors and the reintegration of the natural and social worlds For example Latour argues that instead of worrying whether we are anthropomorphizing technology we should embrace it as inherently anthropomorphic technology is made by humans substitutes for the actions of humans and shapes human action What is important is the chain and gradients of actors' actions and competences and the degree to which we choose to have figurative representations Key concepts include the \n inscription \n of beliefs practices relations into technology which is then said to \n embody \n them Key authors include \n Latour \n and Callon \n Structuration theory \n defines structures as rules and resources organized as properties of social systems The theory employs a recursive notion of actions constrained and enabled by structures which are produced and reproduced by that action Consequently in this theory technology is not rendered as an artifact but instead examines how people as they interact with a technology in their ongoing practices enact structures which shape their emergent and situated use of that technology Key authors include DeSantis and Poole and Orlikowski \n Systems theory \n considers the historical development of technology and media with an emphasis on inertia and heterogeneity stressing the connections between the artifact being built and the social economic political and cultural factors surrounding it Key concepts include \n reverse salients \n when elements of a system lag in development with respect to others differentiation \n operational closure \n and \n autopoietic autonomy \n Key authors include \n Thomas P Hughes \n and \n Luhmann \n Activity theory \n Critical approaches \n Critical theory \n goes beyond a descriptive account of how things are to examine why they have come to be that way and how they might otherwise be Critical theory asks whose interests are being served by the \n status quo \n and assesses the potential of future alternatives to better serve social justice According to Geuss's definition \"a critical theory then is a reflective theory which gives agents a kind of knowledge inherently productive of enlightenment and emancipation' Marcuse argued that whilst matters of technology design are often presented as neutral technical choices in fact they manifest political or moral values Critical theory is a form of archaeology that attempt to get beneath common-sense understandings in order to reveal the power relationships and interests determining particular technological configuration and use \n Perhaps the most developed contemporary critical theory of technology is contained in the works of \n Andrew Feenberg \n including 'Transforming Technology' \n Values in Design - asks how do we ensure a place for values alongside technical standards such as speed efficiency and reliability as criteria by which we judge the quality and acceptability of information systems and new media How do values such as privacy autonomy democracy and social justice become integral to conception design and development not merely retrofitted after completion? Key thinkers include \n Helen Nissenbaum \n Other stances \n Additionally many authors have posed technology so as to critique and or emphasize aspects of technology as addressed by the mainline theories For example \n Steve Woolgar \n considers \n technology as text \n in order to critique the \n sociology of scientific knowledge \n as applied to technology and to distinguish between three responses to that notion the instrumental response interpretive flexibility the interpretivist response environmental/organizational influences the reflexive response a double hermeneutic Pfaffenberger treats \n technology as drama \n to argue that a recursive structuring of technological artifacts and their social structure discursively regulate the technological construction of political power A technological drama is a discourse of technological \"statements\" and \"counterstatements\" within the processes of technological regularization adjustment and reconstitution \n An important philosophical approach to technology has been taken by \n Bernard Stiegler \n whose work has been influenced by other philosophers and historians of technology including \n Gilbert Simondon \n and \n Andr Leroi-Gourhan \n In the Schumpeterian and Neo-Schumpeterian theories technologies are critical factors of \n economic growth \n Carlota Perez \n Group theories \n There are also a number of technology related theories that address how media technology affects group processes Broadly these theories are concerned with the social effects of communication media Some e g media richness are concerned with questions of media choice i e when to use what medium effectively Other theories social presence SIDE media naturalness are concerned with the consequences of those media choices i e what are the social effects of using particular communication media \n Social presence theory \n Short et al is a seminal theory of the social effects of communication technology Its main concern is with telephony and telephone conferencing the research was sponsored by the British Post Office now British Telecom It argues that the social impact of a communication medium depend on the \n social presence \n it allows communicators to have Social presence is defined as a property of the medium itself the degree of acoustic visual and physical contact that it allows The theory assumes that more contact will increase the key components of \"presence\" greater intimacy immediacy warmth and inter-personal rapport As a consequence of social presence social influence is expected to increase In the case of communication technology the assumption is that more text-based forms of interaction e-mail instant messaging are less social and therefore less conducive to social influence \n Media richness theory \n Daft & Lengel shares some characteristics with social presence theory It posits that the amount of information communicated differs with respect to a medium's \n richness \n The theory assumes that resolving ambiguity and reducing uncertainty are the main goals of communication Because communication media differ in the rate of understanding they can achieve in a specific time with \"rich\" media carrying more information they are not all capable of resolving uncertainty and ambiguity well The more restricted the medium's capacity the less uncertainty and equivocality it is able to manage It follows that the richness of the media should be matched to the task so as to prevent over simplification or complication \n Media naturalness theory \n Kock builds on human evolution ideas and has been proposed as an alternative to media richness theory Media naturalness theory argues that since our Stone Age hominid ancestors have communicated primarily face-to-face evolutionary pressures have led to the development of a brain that is consequently designed for that form of communication Other forms of communication are too recent and unlikely to have posed evolutionary pressures that could have shaped our brain in their direction Using communication media that suppress key elements found in face-to-face communication as many electronic communication media do thus ends up posing cognitive obstacles to communication This is particularly the case in the context of complex tasks e g business process redesign new product development online learning because such tasks seem to require more intense communication over extended periods of time than simple tasks \n Media synchronicity theory MST Dennis & Valacich redirects richness theory towards the \n synchronicity \n of the communication \n The \n social identity model of deindividuation effects SIDE \n Postmes Spears and Lea Reicher Spears and Postmes Spears & Lea was developed as a response to the idea that anonymity and reduced presence made communication technology socially impoverished or \"deindividuated\" It provided an alternative explanation for these \" \n deindividuation \n effects\" based on theories of social identity e g Turner et al The SIDE model distinguishes cognitive and strategic effects of a communication technology Cognitive effects occur when communication technologies make \"salient\" particular aspects of personal or social identity For example certain technologies such as email may disguise characteristics of the sender that individually differentiate them i e that convey aspects of their personal identity and as a result more attention may be given to their social identity The strategic effects are due to the possibilities afforded by communication technology to selectively communicate or enact particular aspects of identity and disguise others SIDE therefore sees the social and the technological as mutually determining and the behavior associated with particular communication forms as the product or interaction of the two \n Time interaction and performance TIP McGrath theory describes work groups as time-based multi-modal and multi-functional social systems Groups interact in one of the modes of inception problem solving conflict resolution and execution The three functions of a group are production towards a goal support affective and well-being norms and roles \n Analytic theories \n Finally there are theories of technology which are not defined or claimed by a proponent but are used by authors in describing existing literature in contrast to their own or as a review of the field \n For example Markus and Robey propose a general technology theory consisting of the causal structures of agency technological organizational imperative emergent its structure variance process and the level micro macro of analysis \n Orlikowski notes that previous conceptualizations of technology typically differ over scope is technology more than hardware? and role is it an external objective force the interpreted human action or an impact moderated by humans? and identifies three models \n Technological imperative \n focuses on organizational characteristics which can be measured and permits some level of contingency \n Strategic choice \n focuses on how technology is influenced by the context and strategies of decision-makers and users \n Technology as a trigger of structural change \n views technology as a social object \n DeSanctis and Poole similarly write of

creativity Michael Mumford suggested \"Over the course of the last decade however we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel useful products\" Mumford p \n or in \n Robert Sternberg \n 's words the production of \"something original and worthwhile\" \n Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature \n As an illustration one definition given by \n Dr E Paul Torrance \n described it as \"a process of becoming sensitive to problems deficiencies gaps in knowledge missing elements disharmonies and so on identifying the difficulty searching for solutions making guesses or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them and finally communicating the results \" \n Aspects \n Theories of creativity particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others have focused on a variety of aspects The dominant factors are usually identified as \"the four Ps\" process product person and place according to \n Mel Rhodes \n A focus on \n process \n is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking such as \n Guilford \n or those describing the staging of the creative process such as \n Wallas \n are primarily theories of creative process A focus on creative \n product \n usually appears in attempts to measure creativity psychometrics see below and in creative ideas framed as successful \n memes \n The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more \n A focus on the nature of the creative \n person \n considers more general intellectual habits such as openness levels of \n ideation \n autonomy expertise exploratory behavior and so on A focus on \n place \n considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes such as degrees of autonomy access to resources and the nature of gatekeepers Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility \n Etymology \n The \n lexeme \n in the English word \n creativity \n comes from the \n Latin \n term \n cre \n \"to create make\" its \n derivational suffixes \n also come from Latin The word \"create\" appeared in English as early as the 14th century notably in Chaucer to indicate divine creation \n in \n The Parson's Tale \n However its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after \n the Enlightenment \n History of the concept \n History of the concept of creativity \n Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity preferring to see art as a form of discovery Asked in \n The Republic \n \"Will we say of a painter that he makes something?\" Plato answers \"Certainly not he merely \n imitates \n \" \n Ancient views \n Most ancient cultures including thinkers of \n Ancient Greece \n Ancient China \n and \n Ancient India \n lacked the concept of creativity seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation The \n ancient Greeks \n had no terms corresponding to \"to create\" or \"creator\" except for the expression \" \n poiein \n \" \"to make\" which only applied to \n poiesis \n poetry and to the \n poietes \n poet or \"maker\" who made it \n Plato \n did not believe in art as a form of creation Asked in \n The Republic \n \"Will we say of a painter that he makes something?\" he answers \"Certainly not he merely \n imitates \n \" \n It is commonly argued that the notion of \"creativity\" originated in \n Western culture \n through \n Christianity \n as a matter of \n divine inspiration \n According to the historian \n Daniel J Boorstin \n \"the early Western conception of creativity was the \n Biblical story of creation \n given in the \n Genesis \n \" \n However this is not creativity in the modern sense which did not arise until the \n Renaissance \n In the Judaeo-Christian tradition creativity was the sole province of God humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work \n A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture for instance \n Muses \n were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods \n Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative \" \n daemon \n \" Greek or \" \n genius \n \" Latin linked to the sacred or the divine However none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the \n Renaissance \n It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen not as a conduit for the divine but from the abilities of \" \n great men \n \" \n The Enlightenment and after \n The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the \n Renaissance \n and even later \n The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the \n Renaissance \n when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual and not God This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time aptly named \n humanism \n which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual \n From this philosophy arose the \n Renaissance man \n or polymath an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation \n One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is \n Leonardo da Vinci \n However this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment \n By the 18th century and the \n Age of Enlightenment \n mention of creativity notably in \n aesthetics \n linked with the concept of \n imagination \n became more frequent \n In the writing of \n Thomas Hobbes \n imagination became a key element of human cognition \n William Duff \n was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of \n genius \n typifying the separation being made between talent productive but breaking no new ground and genius \n As a direct and independent topic of study creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century \n Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of \n Darwinism \n In particular they refer to the work of \n Francis Galton \n who through his \n eugenicist \n outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence with creativity taken as an aspect of genius \n In the late 19th and early 20th centuries leading mathematicians and scientists such as \n Hermann von Helmholtz \n and \n Henri Poincar \n began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes \n Twentieth century to the present day \n The insights of Poincar and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as \n Graham Wallas \n and \n Max Wertheimer \n In his work \n Art of Thought \n published in Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process In the Wallas stage model creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of stages \n i \n preparation \n preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions \n ii \n incubation \n where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening \n iii \n intimation \n the creative person gets a \"feeling\" that a solution is on its way \n iv \n illumination \n or insight where the creative idea bursts forth from its \n preconscious \n processing into conscious awareness \n v \n verification \n where the idea is consciously verified elaborated and then applied \n Wallas' model is often treated as four stages with \"intimation\" seen as a sub-stage \n Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the \n evolutionary \n process which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments Simonton \n provides an updated perspective on this view in his book \n Origins of genius Darwinian perspectives on creativity \n In \n Alfred North Whitehead \n gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh later published as \n Process and Reality \n He is credited with having coined the term \"creativity\" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme \"Whitehead actually coined the term our term still the preferred currency of exchange among literature science and the arts a term that quickly became so popular so omnipresent that its invention within living memory and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people quickly became occluded\" \n The formal \n psychometric \n measurement of creativity from the standpoint of orthodox \n psychological \n literature is usually considered to have begun with \n J P Guilford \n 's address to the \n American Psychological Association \n which helped popularize the topic \n and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as with the work of H L Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination \n but it did not have the same impact Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity as measured as a separate aspect of human cognition to \n IQ \n -type intelligence into which it had previously been subsumed Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down \n \"Four C\" model \n James C Kaufman \n and Beghetto introduced a \"four C\" model of creativity \n mini-c \n \"transformative learning\" involving \"personally meaningful interpretations of experiences actions and insights\" \n little-c \n everyday problem solving and creative expression \n Pro-C \n exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent and \n Big-C \n creativity considered great in the given field This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity It also the authors argued made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals \n The contrast of terms \"Big C\" and \"Little c\" has been widely used Kozbelt Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity \n Margaret Boden \n distinguishes between h-creativity historical and p-creativity personal \n Robinson \n and Anna Craft \n have focused on creativity in a general population particularly with respect to education Craft makes a similar distinction between \"high\" and \"little c\" creativity \n and cites \n Ken Robinson \n as referring to \"high\" and \"democratic\" creativity \n Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi \n has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative perhaps domain-changing contributions Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity \n Theories of creative processes \n There has been much empirical study in \n psychology \n and \n cognitive science \n of the processes through which creativity occurs Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity \n Incubation \n Incubation is a temporary break from creative problem solving that can result in insight \n There has been some empirical research looking at whether as the concept of \"incubation\" in Wallas' model implies a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving Ward \n lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving and notes how some \n empirical evidence \n is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables \"forgetting\" of misleading clues Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become \n fixated \n on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem \n This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks \n This earlier hypothesis is discussed in \n Csikszentmihalyi \n 's five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem \n Convergent and divergent thinking \n J P Guilford \n drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production commonly renamed \n convergent \n and \n divergent thinking \n Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single correct solution to a problem whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature Other researchers have occasionally used the terms \n flexible \n thinking or \n fluid intelligence \n which are roughly similar to but not synonymous with creativity \n citation needed \n Creative cognition approach \n In Finke et al proposed the \"Geneplore\" model in which creativity takes place in two phases a generative phase where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts \n Weisberg \n argued by contrast that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results \n The ExplicitImplicit Interaction EII theory \n Helie and Sun \n recently proposed a unified framework for understanding \n creativity in problem solving \n namely the ExplicitImplicit Interaction EII theory of creativity This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of \n incubation \n and \n insight \n The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles namely \n The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge \n The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks \n The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge \n The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing \n The iterative and possibly bidirectional processing \n A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the \n CLARION cognitive architecture \n and used to simulate relevant human data This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation insight and various other related phenomena \n Conceptual blending \n Conceptual blending \n In \n The Act of Creation \n Arthur Koestler \n introduced the concept of \n bisociation \n that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference \n This idea was later developed into conceptual blending In the 1990s various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with \n metaphor \n analogy \n and \n structure mapping \n have been converging and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science art and humor has emerged under the label \n conceptual blending \n Honing theory \n Honing theory developed principally by psychologist \n Liane Gabora \n posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing self-mending nature of a worldview The creative process is a way in which the individual hones and re-hones an integrated worldview Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process When faced with a creatively demanding task there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview and the worldview changes through interaction with the task This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete at which point not only is the task conceived of differently but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components whether they be ideas attitudes or bits of knowledge \n A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state \n Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly mutating predefined possibilities but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task Thus the creative idea may feel half-baked It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with \n Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity for example how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise but it is predicted by honing theory according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive nurturing trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization However research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity which would stimulate honing \n Everyday imaginative thought \n In everyday thought people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think \"if only \" \n Their \n counterfactual thinking \n is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes \n It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought \n Assessing individual creative ability \n Creativity quotient \n Several attempts have been made to develop a \n creativity quotient \n of an individual similar to the \n intelligence quotient \n IQ however these have been unsuccessful \n Psychometric approach \n J P Guilford \n 's group \n which pioneered the modern \n psychometric \n study of creativity constructed several tests to measure creativity in \n Plot Titles where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles \n Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness \n Figure Concepts where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings these were scored for uncommonness \n Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks \n Remote Associations where participants are asked to find a word between two given words e g Hand Call \n Remote Consequences where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events e g loss of gravity \n Building on Guilford's work \n Torrance \n developed the \n Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking \n in \n They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills which were scored on \n Fluency \n The total number of interpretable meaningful and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus \n Originality \n The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects \n Elaboration \n The amount of detail in the responses \n The \n Creativity Achievement Questionnaire \n a self-report test that measures creative achievement across domains was described in and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output \n Such tests sometimes called \n Divergent Thinking DT \n tests have been both supported \n and criticized \n Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of \n divergent thinking \n tests using semantic approach When compared to human raters \n NLP \n techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality when compared to human raters \n The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of and respectively to human graders \n Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures \n Most recently an NSF-funded \n team of researchers led by \n James C Kaufman \n and Mark A Runco \n combined expertise in creativity research natural language processing computational linguistics and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system This system enabled automated scoring of \n DT \n tests that is reliable objective and scalable thus addressing most of the issues of \n DT \n tests that had been found and reported \n The resultant computer system was able to achieve a correlation of to human graders \n Social-personality approach \n Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity In these studies personality traits such as independence of judgement self-confidence attraction to complexity aesthetic orientation and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals \n A \n meta-analysis \n by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be \"more open to new experiences less conventional and less conscientious more self-confident self-accepting driven ambitious dominant hostile and impulsive \" Openness conscientiousness self-acceptance hostility and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed \n Within the framework of the \n Big Five \n model of personality some consistent traits have emerged \n Openness to experience \n has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity \n Among the other Big Five traits research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity Compared to non-artists artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness while scientists are more open to experience \n conscientious \n and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists \n Creativity and intelligence \n The potential relationship between creativity and \n intelligence \n has been of interest since the late 1900s when a multitude of influential studies from Getzels & Jackson \n Barron \n Wallach & Kogan \n and Guilford \n focused not only on creativity but also on intelligence This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related but also how and why \n There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship with the main theories as follows \n Threshold Theory Intelligence is a necessary but not sufficient condition for creativity There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120 \n Certification Theory Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence Instead individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence \n Interference Theory Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability \n Sternberg and OHara \n proposed a framework of possible relationships between creativity and intelligence \n Creativity is a subset of intelligence \n Intelligence is a subset of creativity \n Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs \n Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct coincident sets \n Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs disjoint sets \n Creativity as a subset of intelligence \n A number of researchers include creativity either explicitly or implicitly as a key component of intelligence \n Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence \n Gardners \n Theory of multiple intelligences \n MIT \n implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT To demonstrate this Gardner cited examples of different famous creators each of whom differed in their types of intelligences e g Picasso spatial intelligence Freud intrapersonal Einstein logical-mathematical and Gandhi interpersonal \n Sternbergs Theory of Successful intelligence \n see \n Triarchic theory of intelligence \n includes creativity as a main component and comprises sub-theories Componential Analytic Contextual Practical and Experiential Creative Experiential sub-theory the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems is directly related to creativity \n The \n CattellHornCarroll theory \n includes creativity as a subset of intelligence Specifically it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval Glr Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include \n ideational fluency associational fluency and originality/creativity Silvia et al \n conducted a study to look at the relationship between divergent thinking and verbal fluency tests and reported that both fluency and originality in divergent thinking were significantly affected by the broad level Glr factor Martindale \n extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages and as the individual begins to understand the problem the processing speed is increased \n The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence \n posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence Type is a conscious process and concerns goal directed thoughts which are explained by \n g \n Type is an unconscious process and concerns spontaneous cognition which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type and Type processes working together in combination The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees \n Intelligence as a subset of creativity \n In this relationship model intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity \n Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity \n Sternberg & Lubarts Investment Theory \n Using the metaphor of a stock market they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors they buy low and sell high in their ideas Like under/low-valued stock creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people The creative individual has to persevere and convince the others of the ideas value After convincing the others and thus increasing the ideas value the creative individual sells high by leaving the idea with the other people and moves onto generating another idea According to this theory six distinct but related elements contribute to successful creativity intelligence knowledge thinking styles personality motivation and environment Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely or in conjunction with the other five factors generate creative thoughts \n Amabiles Componential Model of Creativity \n In this model there are within-individual components needed for creativity domain-relevant skills creativity-relevant processes and task motivation and component external to the individual their surrounding social environment Creativity requires a confluence of all components High creativity will result when an individual is intrinsically motivated possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking and is working in a highly creative environment \n Amusement Park Theoretical Model \n In this 4-step theory both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels intelligence plays a key role \n To get into the amusement park there are initial requirements e g time/transport to go to the park Initial requirements like intelligence are necessary but not sufficient for creativity They are more like prerequisites for creativity and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement intelligence then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour \n Secondly are the subcomponents general thematic areas that increase in specificity Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit e g a zoo or a water park these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative e g poetry \n Thirdly there are specific domains After choosing the type of park to visit e g waterpark you then have to choose which specific park to go to Within the poetry domain there are many different types e g free verse riddles sonnet etc that have to be selected from \n Lastly there are micro-domains These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e g individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark \n Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs \n This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct but intersecting constructs \n Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs \n Renzullis Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness \n In this conceptualisation giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability creativity and task commitment Under this view creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs but they do overlap under the correct conditions \n PASS theory of intelligence \n In this theory the planning component relating to the ability to solve problems make decisions and take action strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity \n Threshold Theory TT A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120 Above this threshold of an IQ of if there is a relationship at all it is small and weak \n TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity \n In support of the TT Barron \n reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample Yamamoto \n in a sample of secondary school children reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of \n r \n = and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children Fuchs-Beauchamp et al \n in a sample of preschoolers found that creativity and intelligence correlated from \n r \n = to \n r \n = in the group of children who had an IQ below the threshold and in the group above the threshold the correlations were \n r \n = < Cho et al \n reported a correlation of between creativity and intelligence in the average IQ group of a sample of adolescents and adults and a correlation of close to \n r \n = for the high IQ group Jauk et al \n found support for the TT but only for measures of creative potential not creative performance \n Much modern day research reports findings against TT Wai et al \n in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood found that differences in SAT scores at age were predictive of creative real-life outcomes years later Kims \n meta-analysis of studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence creativity and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of Preckel et al \n investigating fluid intelligence and creativity reported small correlations of \n r \n = to \n r \n = across all levels of cognitive ability \n Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets \n Under this view researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving and in normal problem solving there is no need for creativity Thus creativity and Intelligence problem solving are the same thing Perkins \n referred to this as the nothing-special view \n Weisberg & Alba \n examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem see \n Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle \n where the participants are asked to connect all dots in the rows of dots using straight lines or less without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight they still found it difficult to solve the problem thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight or creativity that is required \n Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets \n In this view creativity and intelligence are completely different unrelated constructs \n Getzels and Jackson \n administered creativity measures to a group of children from grades 6-12 and compared these test findings to results from previously administered by the school IQ tests They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was \n r \n = The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers The high intelligence group scored the opposite they scored in the top 20% for IQ but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated \n However this work has been heavily criticised Wallach and Kogan \n highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills McNemar \n noted that there were major measurement issues in that the IQ scores were a mixture from different IQ tests \n Wallach and Kogan \n administered measures of creativity each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency and measures of general intelligence to 5th grade children These tests were untimed and given in a game-like manner aiming to facilitate creativity Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average \n r \n = Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average \n r \n = with each other Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated \n r \n = \n Neuroscience \n The \n neuroscience \n of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour It has been addressed \n in the article \"Creative Innovation Possible Brain Mechanisms \" The authors write that \"creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected \" Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways \n they have a high level of specialized knowledge \n they are capable of \n divergent thinking \n mediated by the \n frontal lobe \n and they are able to modulate \n neurotransmitters \n such as \n norepinephrine \n in their frontal lobe \n Thus the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the \n cortex \n that is most important for creativity \n This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep \n mood \n and \n addiction disorders \n and \n depression \n In Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive Drawing from evidence in brain imaging drug studies and lesion analysis she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes the \n temporal lobes \n and \n dopamine \n from the \n limbic system \n The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation Abnormalities in the frontal lobe such as depression or anxiety generally decrease creativity while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe and vice versa High dopamine levels increase general \n arousal \n and goal directed behaviors and reduce \n latent inhibition \n and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas \n A study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks including those that support associative thinking along with other \n default mode network \n functions \n Working memory and the cerebellum \n Vandervert \n described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the \n cerebellum \n collaborate to produce creativity and innovation Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of \n working memory \n responsible for processing all thought \n are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum \n The cerebellum consisting of billion neurons which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain \n is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes \n where creative and innovative thoughts arise \n Apparently creative insight or the \"aha\" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe \n According to Vandervert the details of creative adaptation begin in \"forward\" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control HMOSAIC \n New hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture HMOSAIC develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion \n Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports art music the design of video games technology mathematics the \n child prodigy \n and thought in general \n Essentially Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed fractionated by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem \n Most recently he has argued that this is the same process only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization that led to the evolution of language in humans \n Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process because it continuously optimizes efficiencies constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas music art or technology \n Prototyping they argue not only produces new products it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself Further Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive \"mental prototyping\" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the \n Khan Academy \n The model proposed by Vandervert has however received incisive critique from several authors \n REM sleep \n Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement Sleep aids this process \n REM \n rather than \n NREM sleep \n appears to be responsible \n This has been suggested to be due to changes in \n cholinergic \n and \n noradrenergic \n neuromodulation \n that occurs during REM sleep \n During this period of sleep high levels of acetylcholine in the \n hippocampus \n suppress feedback from the hippocampus to the \n neocortex \n and lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the spread of associational activity within neocortical areas without control from the hippocampus \n This is in contrast to waking consciousness where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing \"neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes \" \n Affect \n Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence As noted in \n voting behavior \n the term \"affect\" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making \n Positive affect relations \n According to \n Alice Isen \n positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity \n Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association \n Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem \n Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated Together these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity \n Barbara Fredrickson \n in her \n broaden-and-build \n model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions thus enhancing creativity \n According to these researchers positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association attention scope and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem cognitive scope \n Various meta-analyses such as Baas et al of studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect \n Creativity and artificial intelligence \n Jrgen Schmidhuber \n 's formal \n theory \n of creativity \n postulates that creativity curiosity and interestingness are by-products of a simple \n computational \n principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own \n sensory \n inputs The agent can use a \n black box \n optimization method such as \n reinforcement learning \n to learn through informed trial and error sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future \n reward \n signals There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals such as finding food when hungry But Schmidhuber's \n objective function \n to be maximized also includes an additional intrinsic term to model \"wow-effects \" This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals A wow-effect is formally defined as follows As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs it keeps improving the predictor or encoder which can be implemented as an \n artificial neural network \n or some other \n machine learning \n device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time The improvements can be measured precisely by computing the difference in computational costs storage size number of required synapses errors time needed to encode new observations before and after learning This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge which changes over time but the theory formally takes this into account The cost difference measures the strength of the present \"wow-effect\" due to sudden improvements in \n data compression \n or computational speed It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects Irregular random data or noise do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress and thus are \"boring\" by nature providing no reward Already known and predictable regularities also are boring Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown novel regular patterns in both actions and observations This motivates the agent to perform continual open-ended active creative exploration \n According to Schmidhuber his objective function explains the activities of scientists artists and \n comedians \n For example \n physicists \n are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished \n physical laws \n permitting better \n data compression \n Likewise composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements Similarly a comedian gets intrinsic reward for \"inventing a novel joke with an unexpected \n punch line \n related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data \" \n Schmidhuber argues that ongoing \n computer hardware \n advances will greatly scale up rudimentary \n artificial \n scientists and artists \n clarification needed \n based on simple implementations of the basic principle since \n He used the theory to create \n low-complexity art \n and an attractive \n human face \n Mental health \n Creativity and mental illness \n A study by psychologist \n J Philippe Rushton \n found creativity to correlate with \n intelligence \n and \n psychoticism \n Another study found creativity to be greater in \n schizotypal \n than in either normal or \n schizophrenic \n individuals While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the \n prefrontal cortex \n schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their \n right \n prefrontal cortex \n This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate In agreement with this hypothesis \n ambidexterity \n is also associated with \n schizotypal \n and \n schizophrenic \n individuals Three recent studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal \n and hypomanic personality \n and several different measures of creativity \n Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and \n mood disorders \n particularly \n manic-depressive disorder \n a k a \n bipolar disorder \n and \n depressive disorder \n a k a \n unipolar disorder \n In \n Touched with Fire Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament \n Kay Redfield Jamison \n summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in \n writers \n poets \n and \n artists \n She also explores research that identifies \n mood disorders \n in such famous writers and artists as \n Ernest Hemingway \n who shot himself after \n electroconvulsive treatment \n Virginia Woolf \n who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on composer \n Robert Schumann \n who died in a mental institution and even the famed \n visual artist \n Michelangelo \n A study looking at persons with schizophrenia bipolar disorder or unipolar depression and their relatives found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder There was no overall overrepresentation but overrepresentation for artistic occupations among those diagnosed with schizophrenia There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives \n Another study involving more than one million people conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders schizophrenia unipolar depression and substance abuse and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder \n However as a group those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder including anorexia and to some extent autism the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports \n According to psychologist Robert Epstein PhD creativity can be obstructed through stress \n Creativity and personality \n Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms depending on unique people and environments A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth innovation speed etc These are referred to as the four \"Creativity Profiles\" that can help achieve such goals \n i \n Incubate \n Long-term Development \n ii \n Imagine \n Breakthrough Ideas \n iii \n Improve \n Incremental Adjustments \n iv \n Invest \n Short-term Goals \n Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at \n Manchester Business School \n has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each \n i \"Idea Generation\" Fluency Originality Incubation and Illumination \n ii \"Personality\" Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity \n iii \"Motivation\" Intrinsic Extrinsic and Achievement \n iv \"Confidence\" Producing Sharing and Implementing \n This model was developed in a sample of working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling \n An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual as characterised by the \n psychometric \n approach and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference \n One characteristic of creative people as measured by some psychologists is what is called \n divergent production \n Divergent production \n is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation \n One way of measuring \n divergent production \n is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking \n The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity quantity and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions \n Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area become experts in their fields and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways In a study of projects by design students students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects \n The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person Motivation stems from two different sources intrinsic and extrinsic motivation Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest desires hopes goals etc Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment rewards fame approval from others etc Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people \n From a personality-traits perspective there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people \n Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences are more self-confident are more ambitious self-accepting impulsive driven dominant and hostile compared to people with less creativity \n From an evolutionary perspective creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas As ideas are continuously generated the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments As a result people have been creating and developing new innovative and creative ideas to build our progress as a society \n In studying exceptionally creative people in history some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found Creative people in history usually had supportive parents but rigid and non-nurturing Most had an interest in their field at an early age and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination \n Another theory of creative people is the \n investment theory of creativity \n This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity In the \n investment \n sense a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea Just like in the financial world some investments are worth the buy in while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected This \n investment theory of creativity \n views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way \n Malevolent creativity \n Malevolent creativity MC focuses on the \"darker side\" of creativity \n This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism However MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying cheating and betrayal \n Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving The personality traits of physical aggression conscientiousness emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC \n Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating those high in implicit aggression even if they were high in impulsiveness were far less destructive in their imagined solutions They concluded premeditation more than implicit aggression controlled an individuals expression of malevolent creativity \n The current measure for malevolent creativity is the item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale MCBS \n Malevolent creativity and crime \n Malevolent creativity has strong links with crime As creativity requires deviating from the conventional there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime \n Creativity across cultures \n Creativity is viewed differently in different countries \n For example cross-cultural research centred on \n Hong Kong \n found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person such as their aesthetic taste while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e g what they can contribute to society \n Mpofu et al surveyed African languages and found that had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' the exception being \n Arabic \n The principle of \n linguistic relativity \n i e that language can affect thought suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages However more research would be needed to establish this and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less or more creative \n Africa \n has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as \n music \n art \n and \n storytelling \n Nevertheless it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa \n and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America \n Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere but here again there are cultural differences even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity For example in Scandinavian countries creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges \n while in Germany creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems \n In organizations \n Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in \n Brazil \n The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity \n It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent For any given organization measures of effectiveness vary depending upon its mission environmental context nature of work the product or service it produces and customer demands Thus the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself how it functions how it is structured and what it emphasizes \n Amabile \n argued that to enhance creativity in business three components were needed \n Expertise technical procedural and intellectual knowledge \n Creative thinking skills how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems \n and Motivation especially \n intrinsic motivation \n There are two types of motivation \n extrinsic motivation \n external \n factors for example \n threats \n of being fired or money as a reward \n intrinsic motivation \n comes from inside an individual satisfaction enjoyment of work etc \n Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are \n Challenge matching people with the right assignments \n Freedom giving people \n autonomy \n choosing means to achieve goals \n Resources \n such as time money space etc There must be balance fit among resources and people \n Work group features \n diverse \n supportive teams where members share the excitement willingness to help and recognize each other's talents \n Supervisory \n encouragement recognitions cheering praising \n Organizational support value emphasis information sharing \n collaboration \n Nonaka who examined several successful Japanese companies similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations \n In particular he emphasized the role that \n tacit knowledge \n has to play in the creative process \n In business \n originality \n is not enough The idea must also be appropriateuseful and \n actionable \n Creative competitive intelligence \n is a new solution to solve this problem According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to \n innovation \n process and \n competitive intelligence \n to creative workers \n Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace It is essential for innovation and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses In the sociologist Silvia Leal Martn using the Innova 3DX method suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation corporate culture work environment leadership and management creativity self-esteem and optimism locus of control and learning orientation motivation and fear \n Similarly social psychologists organizational scientists and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition team processes and organizational culture as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation \n Team Composition \n Diversity between team members backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways However under some conditions diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives \n Thus the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity \n Team Processes \n Team communication \n norms \n such as respecting others expertise paying attention to others ideas expecting information sharing tolerating disagreements \n negotiating \n remaining open to others ideas learning from others and building on each others ideas increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with \n brainstorming \n and \n problem solving \n Through these processes team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge reach shared understandings identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks and make new connections between ideas Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team \n affect \n which facilitates collective creativity \n Organizational Culture \n Supportive and motivational environments that create \n psychological safety \n by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well \n Organizations in which \n help-seeking \n help giving \n and \n collaboration \n are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur \n Additionally \n leadership styles \n that downplay status hierarchies or power differences within an organization and empower people to speak up about their ideas or opinions also help to create cultures that are conducive to creativity \n Economic views of creativity \n Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects the impact of creativity on economic growth methods of modelling markets for creativity and the maximisation of economic creativity innovation \n In the early 20th century \n Joseph Schumpeter \n introduced the economic theory of \n creative destruction \n to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new Some economists such as \n Paul Romer \n view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and consequently economic growth Creativity leads to \n capital \n and creative products are protected by \n intellectual property \n laws \n Mark A Runco \n and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a \" \n psychoeconomic \n \" model of creativity \n In such a model creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive \n utility \n and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations \n The \n creative class \n is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies In his book \n The Rise of the Creative Class \n economist \n Richard Florida \n popularized the notion that regions with \"3 T's of economic development Technology Talent and Tolerance\" also have high concentrations of \n creative professionals \n and tend to have a higher level of economic development \n Fostering creativity \n Creativity techniques \n Daniel Pink in his book \n A Whole New Mind \n repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important In this \n conceptual age \n we will need to foster and encourage \n right-directed thinking \n representing creativity and emotion over \n left-directed thinking \n representing logical analytical thought However this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data \n Nickerson \n provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry \n Establishing purpose and intention \n Building basic skills \n Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge \n Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration \n Building motivation especially internal motivation \n Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks \n Focusing on mastery and self-competition \n Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity \n Providing opportunities for choice and discovery \n Developing self-management metacognitive skills \n Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance \n Providing balance \n Some see the conventional system of \n schooling \n as \"stifling\" of creativity and attempt particularly in the \n preschool \n / \n kindergarten \n and early school years to provide a creativity-friendly rich imagination-fostering environment for young children \n Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise \n In addition to helping with problem solving creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so \n See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought \n Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating valued for its own sake \n To promote creative thinking educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks \n Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it \n Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual Such ideas range from the \n psychological \n -cognitive such as \n Osborn \n - \n Parnes \n Creative Problem Solving Process \n Synectics \n science-based creative thinking Purdue Creative Thinking Program and \n Edward de Bono \n 's \n lateral thinking \n to the highly structured such as \n TRIZ \n the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving developed by the Russian scientist \n Genrich Altshuller \n and Computer-Aided \n morphological analysis \n Creativity has also been identified as one of the key \n 21st century skills \n and as one of the \n Four Cs of 21st century learning \n by educational leaders and theorists in the United States \n List of academic journals addressing creativity \n Creativity Research Journal \n Creativity

\n knowledge economy \n is the \n use of knowledge \n savoir \n savoir-faire \n savoir-tre to generate tangible and intangible values Technology and in particular knowledge technology help to incorporate part of human knowledge into machines This knowledge can be used by decision support systems in various fields to generate economic value Knowledge economy is also possible without technology \n The term was popularized by \n Peter Drucker \n as the title of Chapter in his book \n The Age of Discontinuity \n that Drucker attributed to economist \n Fritz Machlup \n originating in the idea of \" \n scientific management \n \" developed by \n Frederick Winslow Taylor \n Other than the agricultural-intensive economies and labor-intensive economies the global economy is in transition to a \"knowledge economy\" \n as an extension of an \" \n information society \n \" in the \n Information Age \n led by \n innovation \n The transition requires that the rules and practices that determined success in the industrial economy need rewriting in an interconnected globalized economy where knowledge resources such as \n trade secrets \n and expertise are as critical as other economic resources \n Concepts \n Evolution \n Driving forces \n Characteristics \n Technology \n Challenges for developing countries \n Bibliography \n Concepts \n A key concept of the knowledge economy is that knowledge and education often referred to as \" \n human capital \n \" can be treated as one of the following two \n A business product as educational and innovative intellectual products and services can be exported for a high value return \n A productive asset \n It can be defined as \n P roduction and services based on knowledge-intensive activities that contribute to an accelerated pace of technical and scientific advance as well as rapid obsolescence The key component of a knowledge economy is a greater reliance on intellectual capabilities than on physical inputs or natural resources \n The initial foundation for the knowledge economy was introduced in in the book \n The Effective Executive \n by Peter Drucker In this book Drucker described the difference between the manual worker page and the \n knowledge worker \n The manual worker according to him works with his or her hands and produces goods or services In contrast a knowledge worker page works with his or her head not hands and produces ideas knowledge and information \n The key problem in the \n formalization \n and \n modeling \n of knowledge economy is a vague definition of \n knowledge \n which is a rather relative concept For example it is not proper to consider \n information society \n as interchangeable with \n knowledge society \n Information \n is usually not equivalent to \n knowledge \n Their use as well depends on individual and group \n preferences \n see the cognitive IPK model which are \"economy-dependent\" \n Evolution \n The knowledge economy is also seen as the latest stage of development in global \n economic restructuring \n Thus far the developed world has transitioned from an agricultural economy pre-Industrial Age largely the \n agrarian sector \n to \n industrial economy \n with the \n Industrial Age \n largely the \n manufacturing sector \n to \n post-industrial \n / \n mass production \n economy mid-1900s largely the \n service sector \n to knowledge economy late 1900s 2000s largely the \n technology \n / \n human capital \n sector This latest stage has been marked by the upheavals in technological innovations and the globally competitive need for \n innovation \n with new products and processes that develop from the research community i e R&D factors universities labs educational institutes \n In the knowledge economy the specialized labor force is characterized as computer literate and well-trained in handling data developing algorithms and simulated models and innovating on processes and systems Harvard Business School Professor \n Michael Porter \n asserts that todays economy is far more dynamic and that \n comparative advantage \n is less relevant than \n competitive advantage \n which rests on making more productive use of inputs which requires continual \n innovation \n \" \n Consequently the technical \n STEM \n careers including computer scientists engineers chemists biologists mathematicians and scientific inventors will see continuous demand in years to come Additionally well-situated clusters which Michael Porter argues is vital in global economies connect locally with linked industries manufacturers and other entities that are related by skills technologies and other common inputs Hence knowledge is the catalyst and connective tissue in modern economies \n With earths depleting natural resources the need for green infrastructure a logistics industry forced into \n just-in-time \n deliveries growing global demand regulatory policy governed by performance results and a host of other items high priority is put on knowledge and research becomes paramount Knowledge provides the technical expertise problem-solving performance measurement and evaluation and data management needed for the transboundary interdisciplinary global scale of todays competition \n Worldwide examples of the knowledge economy taking place among many others include \n Silicon Valley \n in California aerospace and automotive engineering in \n Munich \n Germany biotechnology in \n Hyderabad \n India electronics and digital media in \n Seoul \n South Korea \n petrochemical \n and energy industry in Brazil Many other cities and regions try to follow a knowledge-driven development paradigm and increase their knowledge base by investing in higher education and research institutions in order to attract high skilled labour and better position themselves in the global competition \n It has been suggested that the next evolutionary step after knowledge economy is the \n network economy \n where the relatively localized knowledge is now being shared among and across various networks for the benefit of the network members as a whole to gain economic of scale in a wider more open scale It has been hypothesized that the gradual evolution of network economy would create a well interconnected economic order which would then begin to concentrate on the passion of individuals gradually leading to a \n Passion based economy \n Driving forces \n Commentators \n who? \n suggest there are various interlocking driving forces which are changing the rules of business and national competitiveness \n Globalization \n markets and products are more global \n Information technology \n which is related to next three \n Information \n / \n Knowledge \n Intensity efficient production relies on information and \n know-how \n many factory workers use their heads more than their hands \n New Media \n New media increases the production and distribution of knowledge which in turn results in \n collective intelligence \n Existing knowledge becomes much easier to access as a result of networked data-bases which promote online interaction between users and producers \n Computer networking \n and Connectivity developments such as the \n Internet \n bring the \" \n global village \n \" ever nearer \n As a result goods and services can be developed bought sold and in many cases even delivered over electronic networks \n As regards the applications of any new technology this depends on how it meets economic demand It can remain dormant or make a commercial breakthrough see \n diffusion of innovation \n Characteristics \n It can be argued that the knowledge economy differs from the traditional economy in several key respects \n The economics are not of scarcity but rather of abundance Unlike most resources that are depleted when used information and \n knowledge can be shared \n and actually grow through application \n The effect of location is either \n diminished in some economic activities using appropriate technology and methods virtual \n marketplaces \n and \n virtual organizations \n that offer benefits of speed agility round the clock operation and global reach can be created \n or on the contrary reinforced in some other economic fields by the creation of \n business clusters \n around centres of knowledge such as universities and research centres However clusters already existed in pre-knowledge economy times \n Laws barriers taxes and ways to measure are difficult to apply solely on a national basis Knowledge and information \"leak\" to where demand is highest and the barriers are lowest \n Knowledge enhanced products or services can command price premiums over comparable products with low embedded knowledge or knowledge intensity \n Pricing \n and value depends heavily on context Thus the same information or knowledge can have vastly different value to different people or even to the same person at different times \n Knowledge when locked into systems or processes has higher inherent value than when it can \"walk out of the door\" in people's heads \n Human capital \n competencies are a key component of value in a knowledge-based company yet few companies report competency levels in annual reports In contrast downsizing is often seen as a positive \"cost cutting\" measure \n Communication \n is increasingly being seen as fundamental to \n knowledge flows \n Social structures cultural context and other factors influencing social relations are therefore of fundamental importance to knowledge economies \n These characteristics require new ideas and approaches from policy makers managers and knowledge workers \n The knowledge economy has manifold forms in which it may appear but there are predictions that the new economy will extend radically creating a pattern in which even ideas will be recognised and identified as a \n commodity \n Technology \n The technology requirements for an \n Innovative System \n as described by the \n World Bank Institute \n must be able to disseminate a \n unified process \n by which a working method may converge scientific and technology solutions and organizational solutions \n According to the World Bank Institutes definition such \n innovation \n would further enable the World Bank Institutes vision outlined in their \n Millennium Development Goals \n Challenges for developing countries \n The United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development report UNCSTD concluded that for developing countries to successfully integrate \n ICTs \n and sustainable development in order to participate in the knowledge economy they need to intervene collectively and strategically \n Such collective intervention suggested would be in the development of effective national ICT policies that support the new regulatory framework promote the selected \n knowledge production \n and use of ICTs and harness their organizational changes to be in line with the \n Millennium Development Goals \n The report further suggests that developing countries to develop the required ICT strategies and policies for institutions and regulations taking into account the need to be responsive to the issues of convergence \n Attention economy \n Automation \n Basic income guarantee \n Cognitive-cultural economy \n Computational knowledge economy \n

the \n Old French \n term \" \n recerchier \n \" a compound word from \"re-\" + \"cerchier\" or \"sercher\" meaning 'search' \n The earliest recorded use of the term was in \n Definitions \n Research has been defined in a number of different ways \n A broad definition of research is given by \n Godwin Colibao \n \"In the broadest sense of the word the definition of research includes any gathering of data information and facts for the advancement of knowledge \" \n Another definition of research is given by John W Creswell who states that \" r esearch is a process of steps used to collect and analyze information to increase our understanding of a topic or issue\" It consists of three steps pose a question collect data to answer the question and present an answer to the question \n The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines research in more detail as \"a studious inquiry or examination especially investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts revision of accepted theories or laws in the light of new facts or practical application of such new or revised theories or laws\" \n Forms of research \n Original research redirects here For the Wikipedia policy see \n Wikipedia No original research \n Original research \n is research that is not exclusively based on a summary review or synthesis of earlier publications on the subject of research This material is of a \n primary source \n character The purpose of the original research is to produce new \n knowledge \n rather than to present the existing knowledge in a new form \n e g \n summarized or classified \n Original research can take a number of forms depending on the discipline it pertains to In \n experimental \n work it typically involves direct or indirect observation of the researched subject s e g in the laboratory or in the field documents the methodology results and conclusions of an experiment or set of experiments or offers a novel interpretation of previous results In \n analytical \n work there are typically some new for example mathematical results produced or a new way of approaching an existing problem In some subjects which do not typically carry out experimentation or analysis of this kind the originality is in the particular way existing understanding is changed or re-interpreted based on the outcome of the work of the \n researcher \n The degree of originality of the research is among major criteria for articles to be published in \n academic journals \n and usually established by means of \n peer review \n Graduate students \n are commonly required to perform original research as part of a \n dissertation \n Scientific research \n is a systematic way of gathering data and harnessing \n curiosity \n This research provides \n scientific \n information and theories for the explanation of the \n nature \n and the properties of the world It makes practical applications possible Scientific research is funded by public authorities by charitable organizations and by private groups including many companies Scientific research can be subdivided into different classifications according to their academic and application disciplines Scientific research is a widely used criterion for judging the standing of an academic institution but some argue that such is an inaccurate assessment of the institution because the quality of research does not tell about the quality of teaching these do not necessarily correlate \n Research in the humanities \n involves different methods such as for example \n hermeneutics \n and \n semiotics \n Humanities scholars usually do not search for the ultimate correct answer to a question but instead explore the issues and details that surround it Context is always important and context can be social historical political cultural or ethnic An example of research in the humanities is historical research which is embodied in \n historical method \n Historians use \n primary sources \n and other \n evidence \n to systematically investigate a topic and then to write histories in the form of accounts of the past Other studies aim to merely examine the occurrence of behaviours in societies and communities without particularly looking for reasons or motivations to explain these These studies may be qualitative or quantitative and can use a variety of approaches such as queer theory or feminist theory \n Artistic research \n also seen as 'practice-based research' can take form when creative works are considered both the research and the object of research itself It is the debatable body of thought which offers an alternative to purely scientific methods in research in its search for knowledge and truth \n Scientific research \n Scientific method \n Primary scientific research being carried out at the \n Microscopy \n Laboratory of the \n Idaho National Laboratory \n Scientific research equipment at \n MIT \n Generally research is understood to follow a certain structural \n process \n Though step order may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher the following steps are usually part of most formal research both basic and applied \n Observations and formation of the topic \n Consists of the subject area of one's interest and following that subject area to conduct subject related research The subject area should not be randomly chosen since it requires reading a vast amount of literature on the topic to determine the gap in the literature the researcher intends to narrow A keen interest in the chosen subject area is advisable The research will have to be justified by linking its importance to already existing knowledge about the topic \n Hypothesis \n A testable prediction which designates the relationship between two or more variables \n Conceptual definition \n Description of a concept by relating it to other concepts \n Operational definition \n Details in regards to defining the variables and how they will be measured/assessed in the study \n Gathering of data \n Consists of identifying a population and selecting samples gathering information from and/or about these samples by using specific research instruments The instruments used for data collection must be valid and reliable \n Analysis of data \n Involves breaking down the individual pieces of data in order to draw conclusions about it \n Data Interpretation \n This can be represented through tables figures and pictures and then described in words \n Test revising of hypothesis \n Conclusion reiteration if necessary \n A common misconception is that a hypothesis will be proven see rather \n null hypothesis \n Generally a hypothesis is used to make predictions that can be tested by observing the outcome of an experiment If the outcome is inconsistent with the hypothesis then the hypothesis is rejected see \n falsifiability \n However if the outcome is consistent with the hypothesis the experiment is said to support the hypothesis This careful language is used because researchers recognize that alternative hypotheses may also be consistent with the observations In this sense a hypothesis can never be proven but rather only supported by surviving rounds of scientific testing and eventually becoming widely thought of as true \n A useful hypothesis allows prediction and within the accuracy of observation of the time the prediction will be verified As the accuracy of observation improves with time the hypothesis may no longer provide an accurate prediction In this case a new hypothesis will arise to challenge the old and to the extent that the new hypothesis makes more accurate predictions than the old the new will supplant it Researchers can also use a null hypothesis which states no relationship or difference between the independent or dependent variables \n Historical research \n Historical method \n German historian \n Leopold von Ranke \n 1795-1886 considered to be one of the founders of modern source-based \n history \n The \n historical method \n comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use \n historical \n sources and other evidence to research and then to write history There are various history guidelines that are commonly used by historians in their work under the headings of external criticism internal criticism and synthesis This includes \n lower criticism \n and sensual criticism Though items may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher the following concepts are part of most formal historical research \n Identification \n of origin date \n Evidence \n of localization \n Recognition \n of authorship \n Analysis \n of data \n Identification of \n integrity \n Attribution of \n credibility \n Artistic research \n The controversial trend of artistic teaching becoming more academics-oriented is leading to artistic research being accepted as the primary mode of enquiry in art as in the case of other disciplines \n One of the characteristics of \n artistic \n research is that it must accept \n subjectivity \n as opposed to the classical scientific methods As such it is similar to the \n social sciences \n in using \n qualitative research \n and \n intersubjectivity \n as tools to apply measurement and critical analysis \n Artistic research has been defined by the \n University of Dance and Circus \n Dans och Cirkushgskolan DOCH \n Stockholm \n in the following manner - \"Artistic research is to investigate and test with the purpose of gaining knowledge within and for our artistic disciplines It is

with presentation of the arts \n For a survey of the central problematics of today's Artistic Research see \n Giaco Schiesser \n According to artist \n Hakan Topal \n in artistic research \"perhaps more so than other disciplines intuition is utilized as a method to identify a wide range of new and unexpected productive modalities\" \n Most writers whether of fiction or non-fiction books also

model structure of research \n The hourglass model starts with a broad spectrum for research focusing in on the required information through the method of the project like the neck of the hourglass then expands the research in the form of discussion and results The major steps in conducting research are \n Identification of research problem \n Literature review \n Specifying the purpose of research \n Determining specific research questions \n Specification of a \n conceptual framework \n usually a set of hypotheses \n Choice of a methodology for data collection \n Data collection \n Verifying data \n Analyzing and interpreting the data \n Reporting and evaluating research \n Communicating the research findings and possibly recommendations \n The steps generally represent the overall process however they should be viewed as an ever-changing iterative process rather than a fixed set of steps \n Most research begins with a general statement of the problem or rather the purpose for engaging in the study \n The literature review identifies flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study Often a \n literature review \n is conducted in a given subject area before a research question is identified A gap in the current literature as identified by a researcher then engenders a research question The research question may be parallel to the \n hypothesis \n The hypothesis is the supposition to be tested The researcher s collects data to test the hypothesis The researcher s then analyzes and interprets the data via a variety of statistical methods engaging in what is known as \n empirical research \n The results of the data analysis in rejecting or failing to reject the \n null hypothesis \n are then reported and evaluated At the end the researcher may discuss avenues for further research However some researchers advocate for the reverse approach starting with articulating findings and discussion of them moving \"up\" to identification of a research problem that emerges in the findings and literature review The reverse approach is justified by the transactional nature of the research endeavor where research inquiry research questions research method relevant research literature and so on are not fully known until the findings have fully emerged and been interpreted \n Rudolph Rummel \n says \" no researcher should accept any one or two tests as definitive It is only when a range of tests are consistent over many kinds of data researchers and methods can one have confidence in the results \" \n Plato \n in \n Meno \n talks about an inherent difficulty if not a paradox of doing research that can be paraphrased in the following way \"If you know what you're searching for why do you search for it?! i e you have already found it If you don't know what you're searching for what are you searching for?!\" \n Research methods \n The research room at the New York Public Library an example of \n secondary research \n in progress \n Maurice Hilleman \n is credited with saving more lives than any other scientist of the 20th century \n The goal of the research process is to produce new knowledge or deepen understanding of a topic or issue This process takes three main forms although as previously discussed the boundaries between them may be obscure \n Exploratory research \n which helps to identify and define a problem or question \n Constructive research \n which tests theories and proposes solutions to a problem or question \n Empirical research \n which tests the feasibility of a solution using \n empirical evidence \n There are two major types of empirical research design qualitative research and quantitative research Researchers choose qualitative or quantitative methods according to the nature of the research topic they want to investigate and the research questions they aim to answer \n Qualitative research \n This involves understanding human behavior and the reasons that govern such behavior by asking a broad question collecting data in the form of words images video etc that is analyzed and searching for themes This type of research aims to investigate a question without attempting to quantifiably measure variables or look to potential relationships between variables It is viewed as more restrictive in testing hypotheses because it can be expensive and time-consuming and typically limited to a single set of research subjects \n citation needed \n Qualitative research is often used as a method of exploratory research as a basis for later quantitative research hypotheses \n citation needed \n Qualitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of \n social constructionism \n Quantitative research \n This involves systematic empirical investigation of quantitative properties and phenomena and their relationships by asking a narrow question and collecting numerical data to analyze it utilizing \n statistical \n methods The quantitative research designs are experimental correlational and survey or descriptive \n Statistics derived from quantitative research can be used to establish the existence of associative or causal relationships between variables Quantitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of \n positivism \n The quantitative data collection methods rely on random sampling and structured data collection instruments that fit diverse experiences into predetermined response categories \n citation needed \n These methods produce results that are easy to summarize compare and generalize \n citation needed \n Quantitative research is concerned with testing hypotheses derived from theory and/or being able to estimate the size of a phenomenon of interest \n If the research question is about people participants may be randomly assigned to different treatments this is the only way that a quantitative study can be considered a true experiment \n citation needed \n If this is not feasible the researcher may collect data on participant and situational characteristics in order to statistically control for their influence on the dependent or outcome variable If the intent is to generalize from the research participants to a larger population the researcher will employ probability sampling to select participants \n In either qualitative or quantitative research the researcher s may collect primary or secondary data Primary data is data collected specifically for the research such as through interviews or questionnaires Secondary data is data that already exists such as \n census \n data which can be re-used for the research It is good ethical research practice to use secondary data wherever possible \n Mixed-method research i e research that includes qualitative and quantitative elements using both primary and secondary data is becoming more common \n Big data \n has brought big impacts on research methods so that now many researchers do not put much effort into data collection furthermore methods to analyze easily available huge amounts of data have also been developed \n Non-empirical research \n Non-empirical \n theoretical \n research is an approach that involves the development of theory as opposed to using observation and experimentation As such non-empirical research seeks solutions to problems using existing knowledge as its source This however does not mean that new ideas and innovations cannot be found within the pool of existing and established knowledge Non-empirical research is not an absolute alternative to empirical research because they may be used together to strengthen a research approach Neither one is less effective than the other since they have their particular purpose in science Typically empirical research produces observations that need to be explained then theoretical research tries to explain them and in so doing generates empirically testable hypotheses these hypotheses are then tested empirically giving more observations that may need further explanation and so on See \n Scientific method \n A simple example of a non-empirical task is the prototyping of a new drug using a differentiated application of existing knowledge another is the development of a business process in the form of a flow chart and texts where all the ingredients are from established knowledge Much of \n cosmological research \n is theoretical in nature \n Mathematics \n research does not rely on externally available data rather it seeks to prove \n theorems \n about \n mathematical objects \n Ethics \n Research ethics involves the application of fundamental \n ethical \n principles to a variety of topics involving research including \n scientific research \n These include the design and implementation of research involving \n human experimentation \n animal experimentation \n various aspects of \n academic scandal \n including \n scientific misconduct \n such as fraud \n fabrication of data \n and \n plagiarism \n whistleblowing \n regulation of research etc Research ethics is most developed as a concept in \n medical research \n The key agreement here is the \n Declaration of Helsinki \n The \n Nuremberg Code \n is a former agreement but with many still important notes Research in the \n social sciences \n presents a different set of issues than those in medical research \n Problems in research \n Methods of research \n In many disciplines Western methods of conducting research are predominant \n Researchers are overwhelmingly taught Western methods of data collection and study The increasing participation of \n indigenous peoples \n as researchers has brought increased attention to the lacuna in culturally-sensitive methods of data collection Non-Western methods of data collection may not be the most accurate or relevant for research on non-Western societies For example \n Hua Oranga \n was created as a criterion for psychological evaluation in \n Mori \n populations and is based on dimensions of mental health important to the Mori people \"taha wairua the spiritual dimension taha hinengaro the mental dimension taha tinana the physical dimension and taha whanau the family dimension \n Linguicism \n Periphery scholars face the challenges of exclusion and \n linguicism \n in research and academic publication As the great majority of mainstream academic journals are written in English multilingual periphery scholars often must translate their work in order to be accepted to elite Western-dominated journals \n Multilingual scholars influences from their native communicative styles can be assumed to be incompetence instead of difference \n Publication \n This article needs to be \n updated \n In particular This subsection's claims are potentially outdated in the \"digital age\" given that near-total penetration of Web access among scholars worldwide enables any scholar s to submit papers to any journal anywhere \n Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information \n May \n Publications from periphery countries rarely rise to the same elite status as those of North America and Europe primarily \n citation needed \n because limitations on the availability of resources including high-quality paper and sophisticated image-rendering software and printing tools render these publications less able to satisfy standards currently carrying formal or informal authority in the publishing industry \n These limitations in turn result in the under-representation of scholars from periphery nations among the set of publications holding prestige status relative to the quantity and quality of those scholars' research efforts and this under-representation in turn results in disproportionately reduced acceptance of the results of their efforts as contributions to the body of knowledge available worldwide \n Influence of the open-access movement \n The open access movement assumes that all information generally deemed useful should be free and belongs to a public domain that of humanity \n This idea gained prevalence as a result of Western colonial history and ignores alternative conceptions of knowledge circulation For instance most indigenous communities consider that access to certain information proper to the group should be determined by relationships \n There is alleged to be a double standard in the Western knowledge system On the one hand digital right management used to restrict access to personal information on social networking platforms is celebrated as a protection of privacy while simultaneously when similar functions are utilised by cultural groups i e indigenous communities this is denounced as access control and reprehended as censorship \n Future perspectives \n Even though Western dominance seems to be prominent in research some scholars such as Simon Marginson argue for the need for a plural university world \n Marginson argues that the East Asian Confucian model could take over the Western model \n This could be due to changes in funding for research both in the East and the West Focussed on emphasizing educational achievement East Asian cultures mainly in China and South Korea have encouraged the increase of funding for research expansion \n In contrast in the Western academic world notably in the United Kingdom as well as in some state governments in the United States funding cuts for university research have occurred which some \n who? \n say may lead to the future decline of Western dominance in research \n

A \n disruptive innovation \n is an \n innovation \n that creates a new \n market \n and \n value network \n and eventually disrupts an existing market and value network displacing established market leading firms products and alliances The term was defined and phenomenon analyzed by \n Clayton M Christensen \n and coworkers beginning in \n Since the early 2000s \"signicant societal impact\" has also been viewed as an aspect of disruptive innovation \n Not all innovations are disruptive even if they are revolutionary For example the first \n automobiles \n in the late 19th century were not a disruptive innovation because early automobiles were expensive luxury items that did not disrupt the market for \n horse-drawn vehicles \n The market for transportation essentially remained intact until the debut of the lower-priced \n Ford Model T \n in \n The \n mass-produced \n automobile was a disruptive innovation because it changed the transportation market whereas the first thirty years of automobiles did not \n Disruptive innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and \n entrepreneurs \n rather than existing market-leading companies The business environment of market leaders does not allow them to pursue disruptive innovations when they first arise because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from sustaining innovations which are needed to compete against current competition \n A disruptive process can take longer to develop than by the conventional approach and the risk associated to it is higher than the other more incremental or evolutionary forms of innovations but once it is deployed in the market it achieves a much faster penetration and higher degree of impact on the established markets \n Beyond business and economics disruptive innovations can also be considered to disrupt \n complex systems \n only including economic and business-related aspects \n History and usage of the term \n Theory \n Disruptive technology \n High-technology effects \n Practical example of disruption \n Examples \n Notes \n Further reading \n History and usage of the term \n The term \n disruptive technologies \n was coined by \n Clayton M Christensen \n and introduced in his article \n Disruptive Technologies Catching the Wave \n which he cowrote with Joseph Bower The article is aimed at management executives who make the funding or purchasing decisions in companies rather than the research community He describes the term further in his book \n The Innovator's Dilemma \n Innovator's Dilemma \n explored the cases of the disk drive industry which with its rapid generational change is to the study of business what fruit flies are to the study of genetics as Christensen was advised in the 1990s \n and the excavating equipment industry where \n hydraulic actuation \n slowly displaced cable-actuated movement In his sequel with Michael E Raynor \n The Innovator's Solution \n Christensen replaced the term \n disruptive technology \n with \n disruptive innovation \n because he recognized that few technologies are intrinsically disruptive or sustaining in character rather it is the \n business model \n that the technology enables that creates the disruptive impact However Christensen's evolution from a technological focus to a business-modelling focus is central to understanding the evolution of business at the market or industry level Christensen and Mark W Johnson who cofounded the management consulting firm \n Innosight \n described the dynamics of \"business model innovation\" in the \n Harvard Business Review \n article \"Reinventing Your Business Model\" \n The concept of disruptive technology continues a long tradition of identifying radical technical change in the study of \n innovation \n by economists and the development of tools for its management at a firm or policy level \n In the late 1990s the automotive sector began to embrace a perspective of \"constructive disruptive technology\" by working with the consultant David E O'Ryan whereby the use of current off-the-shelf technology was integrated with newer innovation to create what he called \"an unfair advantage\" The process or technology change as a whole had to be \"constructive\" in improving the current method of manufacturing yet disruptively impact the whole of the business case model resulting in a significant reduction of waste energy materials labor or legacy costs to the user \n In keeping with the insight that what matters economically is the business model not the technological sophistication itself Christensen's theory explains why many disruptive innovations are \n not \n \"advanced technologies\" which the technology mudslide hypothesis would lead one to expect Rather they are often novel combinations of existing off-the-shelf components applied cleverly to a small fledgling value network \n Theory \n The current theoretical understanding of disruptive innovation is different from what might be expected by default an idea that \n Clayton M Christensen \n called the \"technology mudslide hypothesis\" This is the simplistic idea that an established firm fails because it doesn't \"keep up technologically\" with other firms In this hypothesis firms are like climbers scrambling upward on crumbling footing where it takes constant upward-climbing effort just to stay still and any break from the effort such as complacency born of profitability causes a rapid downhill slide Christensen and colleagues have shown that this simplistic hypothesis is wrong it doesn't model reality What they have shown is that good firms are usually aware of the innovations but their business environment does not allow them to pursue them when they first arise because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from that of sustaining innovations which are needed to compete against current competition In Christensen's terms a firm's existing \n value networks \n place insufficient value on the disruptive innovation to allow its pursuit by that firm Meanwhile start-up firms inhabit different value networks at least until the day that their disruptive innovation is able to invade the older value network At that time the established firm in that network can at best only fend off the \n market share \n attack with a me-too entry for which survival not thriving is the only reward \n Christensen defines a disruptive innovation as a product or service designed for a new set of customers \n \"Generally disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward consisting of off-the-shelf components put together in a product architecture that was often simpler than prior approaches They offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so could rarely be initially employed there They offered a different package of attributes valued only in emerging markets remote from and unimportant to the mainstream \" \n Christensen argues that disruptive innovations can hurt successful well-managed companies that are responsive to their customers and have excellent research and development These companies tend to ignore the markets most susceptible to disruptive innovations because the markets have very tight profit margins and are too small to provide a good growth rate to an established sizable firm \n Thus disruptive technology provides an example of an instance when the common business-world advice to \" \n focus on the customer \n \" or \"stay close to the customer\" or \"listen to the customer\" can be strategically counterproductive \n While Christensen argued that disruptive innovations can hurt successful well-managed companies O'Ryan countered that \"constructive\" integration of existing new and forward-thinking innovation could improve the economic benefits of these same well-managed companies once decision-making management understood the systemic benefits as a whole \n How low-end disruption occurs over time \n Christensen distinguishes between \"low-end disruption\" which targets customers who do not need the full performance valued by customers at the high end of the market and \"new-market disruption\" which targets customers who have needs that were previously unserved by existing incumbents \n \"Low-end disruption\" occurs when the rate at which products improve exceeds the rate at which customers can adopt the new performance Therefore at some point the performance of the product overshoots the needs of certain customer segments At this point a disruptive technology may enter the market and provide a product that has lower performance than the incumbent but that exceeds the requirements of certain segments thereby gaining a foothold in the market \n In low-end disruption the disruptor is focused initially on serving the least profitable customer who is happy with a good enough product This type of customer is not willing to pay premium for enhancements in product functionality Once the disruptor has gained a foothold in this customer segment it seeks to improve its profit margin To get higher profit margins the disruptor needs to enter the segment where the customer is willing to pay a little more for higher quality To ensure this quality in its product the disruptor needs to innovate The incumbent will not do much to retain its share in a not-so-profitable segment and will move up-market and focus on its more attractive customers After a number of such encounters the incumbent is squeezed into smaller markets than it was previously serving And then finally the disruptive technology meets the demands of the most profitable segment and drives the established company out of the market \n \"New market disruption\" occurs when a product fits a new or emerging market segment that is not being served by existing incumbents in the industry \n The extrapolation of the theory to all aspects of life has been challenged \n as has the methodology of relying on selected case studies as the principal form of evidence \n Jill Lepore \n points out that some companies identified by the theory as victims of disruption a decade or more ago rather than being defunct remain dominant in their industries today including \n Seagate Technology \n U S Steel \n and \n Bucyrus \n Lepore questions whether the theory has been oversold and misapplied as if it were able to explain everything in every sphere of life including not just business but education and public institutions \n Disruptive technology \n In \n Milan Zeleny \n described high technology as disruptive technology and raised the question of what is being disrupted The answer according to Zeleny is the \n support network \n of high technology \n For example introducing electric cars disrupts the support network for gasoline cars network of gas and service stations Such disruption is fully expected and therefore effectively resisted by support net owners In the long run high disruptive technology bypasses upgrades or replaces the outdated support network \n Technology being a form of social relationship \n citation needed \n always evolves No technology remains fixed Technology starts develops persists mutates stagnates and declines just like living \n organisms \n The evolutionary life cycle occurs in the use and development of any technology A new high-technology core emerges and challenges existing \n technology support nets \n TSNs which are thus forced to coevolve with it New versions of the core are designed and fitted into an increasingly appropriate TSN with smaller and smaller high-technology effects High technology becomes regular technology with more efficient versions fitting the same support net Finally even the efficiency gains diminish emphasis shifts to product tertiary attributes appearance style and technology becomes TSN-preserving appropriate technology This technological equilibrium state becomes established and fixated resisting being interrupted by a technological mutation then new high technology appears and the cycle is repeated \n Regarding this evolving process of technology \n Christensen \n said \n \"The technological changes that damage established companies are usually not radically new or difficult from a technological point of view They do however have two important characteristics First they typically present a different package of performance attributesones that at least at the outset are not valued by existing customers Second the performance attributes that existing customers do value improve at such a rapid rate that the new technology can later invade those established markets \" \n Joseph Bower \n explained the process of how disruptive technology through its requisite support net dramatically transforms a certain industry \n \"When the technology that has the potential for revolutionizing an industry emerges established companies typically see it as unattractive its not something their mainstream customers want and its projected profit margins arent sufficient to cover big-company cost structure As a result the new technology tends to get ignored in favor of whats currently popular with the best customers But then another company steps in to bring the innovation to a new market Once the disruptive technology becomes established there smaller-scale innovation rapidly raise the technologys performance on attributes that mainstream customers value \" \n The automobile was high technology with respect to the horse carriage however it evolved into technology and finally into appropriate technology with a stable unchanging TSN The main high-technology advance in the offing is some form of \n electric car \n whether the energy source is the sun hydrogen water air pressure or traditional charging outlet Electric cars preceded the gasoline automobile by many decades and are now returning to replace the traditional gasoline automobile \n Milan Zeleny \n described the above phenomenon \n He also wrote that \n \"Implementing high technology is often resisted This resistance is well understood on the part of active participants in the requisite TSN The electric car will be resisted by gas-station operators in the same way automated teller machines ATMs were resisted by bank tellers and automobiles by horsewhip makers Technology does not qualitatively restructure the TSN and therefore will not be resisted and never has been resisted Middle management resists \n business process reengineering \n because BPR represents a direct assault on the support net coordinative hierarchy they thrive on Teamwork and multi-functionality is resisted by those whose TSN provides the comfort of narrow specialization and command-driven work \" \n High-technology effects \n High technology \n is a technology core that changes the very architecture structure and organization of the components of the \n technology support net \n High technology therefore transforms the qualitative nature of the TSN's tasks and their relations as well as their requisite physical energy and information flows It also affects the skills required the roles played and the styles of management and coordinationthe organizational culture itself \n This kind of technology core is different from regular technology core which preserves the qualitative nature of flows and the structure of the support and only allows users to perform the same tasks in the same way but faster more reliably in larger quantities or more efficiently It is also different from appropriate technology core which preserves the TSN itself with the purpose of technology implementation and allows users to do the same thing in the same way at comparable levels of efficiency instead of improving the efficiency of performance \n As for the difference between high technology and low technology Milan Zeleny once said \n \" The effects of high technology always breaks the direct comparability by changing the system itself therefore requiring new measures and new assessments of its productivity High technology cannot be compared and evaluated with the existing technology purely on the basis of cost net present value or return on investment Only within an unchanging and relatively stable TSN would such direct financial comparability be meaningful For example you can directly compare a manual typewriter with an electric typewriter but not a typewriter with a word processor Therein lies the management challenge of high technology \" \n However not all modern technologies are high technologies They have to be used as such function as such and be embedded in their requisite TSNs They have to empower the individual because only through the individual can they empower knowledge Not all information technologies have integrative effects Some information systems are still designed to improve the traditional hierarchy of command and thus preserve and entrench the existing TSN The administrative model of management for instance further aggravates the division of task and labor further specializes knowledge separates management from workers and concentrates information and knowledge in centers \n As knowledge surpasses capital labor and raw materials as the dominant economic resource technologies are also starting to reflect this shift Technologies are rapidly shifting from centralized hierarchies to distributed networks Nowadays knowledge does not reside in a super-mind super-book or super-database but in a complex relational pattern of networks brought forth to coordinate human action \n Practical example of disruption \n In the practical world the popularization of \n personal computers \n illustrates how knowledge contributes to the ongoing technology innovation The original centralized concept one computer many persons is a knowledge-defying idea of the prehistory of computing and its inadequacies and failures have become clearly apparent The era of personal computing brought powerful computers \"on every desk\" one person one computer This short transitional period was necessary for getting used to the new computing environment but was inadequate from the vantage point of producing knowledge Adequate knowledge creation and management come mainly from networking and distributed computing one person many computers Each person's computer must form an access point to the entire computing landscape or ecology through the Internet of other computers databases and mainframes as well as production distribution and retailing facilities and the like For the first time technology empowers individuals rather than external hierarchies It transfers influence and power where it optimally belongs at the \n loci \n of the useful knowledge Even though hierarchies and bureaucracies do not innovate free and empowered individuals do knowledge innovation spontaneity and self-reliance are becoming increasingly valued and promoted \n Examples \n This section \n needs additional or better citations for \n verification
