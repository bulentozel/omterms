Administration Do it yourself DIY is the method of building modifying or repairing things without the direct aid of experts or professionals Academic research describes DIY as behaviors where \"individuals engage raw and semi-raw materials and component parts to produce transform or reconstruct material possessions including those drawn from the natural environment e g landscaping \"   DIY behavior can be triggered by various motivations previously categorized as marketplace motivations economic benefits lack of product availability lack of product quality need for customization and identity enhancement craftsmanship empowerment community seeking uniqueness   The term \"do-it-yourself\" has been associated with consumers since at least   primarily in the domain of home improvement and maintenance activities   The phrase \"do it yourself\" had come into common usage in standard English by the 1950s   in reference to the emergence of a trend of people undertaking home improvement and various other small craft and construction projects as both a creative-recreational and cost-saving activity Subsequently the term DIY has taken on a broader meaning that covers a wide range of skill sets DIY is associated with the international alternative rock punk rock and indie rock music scenes indymedia networks pirate radio stations and the zine community In this context DIY is related to the Arts and Crafts movement in that it offers an alternative to modern consumer culture 's emphasis on relying on others to satisfy needs It has also become prevalent in the personal finance When investing in the stock one can utilize a professional advisor or partake in do-it-yourself investing Contents   History   Home improvement   Fashion   Subculture   Groups and Publications       References History edit Italian archaeologists unearthed the ruins of a 6th-century BC Greek structure in southern Italy that came with detailed assembly instructions and is being called an \"ancient IKEA building\" The structure was a temple-like building discovered at Torre Satriano near the southern city of Potenza in Basilicata a region where local people mingled with Greeks who settled along the southern coast known as Magna Graecia and in Sicily from the 8th century BC onwards Professor Christopher Smith director of the British School at Rome said that the discovery was \"the clearest example yet found of mason's marks of the time It looks as if someone was instructing others how to mass-produce components and put them together in this way\" Much like the instruction booklets various sections of the luxury building were inscribed with coded symbols showing how the pieces slotted together The characteristics of these inscriptions indicate they date back to around the 6th century BC which tallies with the architectural evidence suggested by the decoration The building was built by Greek artisans coming from the Spartan colony of Taranto in Apulia       In North America there was a DIY magazine publishing niche in the first half of the twentieth century Magazines such as Popular Mechanics founded in   and Mechanix Illustrated founded in   offered a way for readers to keep current on useful practical skills techniques tools and materials As many readers lived in rural or semi-rural regions initially much of the material related to their needs on the farm or in a small town Home improvement edit   Home improvement Shelves attached to a toy vehicle The DIY movement is a re-introduction often to urban and suburban dwellers of the old pattern of personal involvement and use of skills in upkeep of a house or apartment making clothes maintenance of cars computers websites or any material aspect of living The philosopher Alan Watts from the \" Houseboat Summit \" panel discussion in a   edition of the San Francisco Oracle reflected a growing sentiment Our educational system in its entirety does nothing to give us any kind of material competence In other words we don't learn how to cook how to make clothes how to build houses how to make love or to do any of the absolutely fundamental things of life The whole education that we get for our children in school is entirely in terms of abstractions It trains you to be an insurance salesman or a bureaucrat or some kind of cerebral character   In the 1970s DIY spread through the North American population of college- and recent-college-graduate age groups In part this movement involved the renovation of affordable rundown older homes But it also related to various projects expressing the social and environmental vision of the 1960s and early 1970s The young visionary Stewart Brand working with friends and family and initially using the most basic of typesetting and page-layout tools published the first edition of The Whole Earth Catalog subtitled Access to Tools in late   Fiberglass dome house California in style of the Whole Earth Catalog building techniques The first Catalog and its successors used a broad definition of the term \"tools\" There were informational tools such as books often technical in nature professional journals courses classes and the like There were specialized designed items such as carpenters ' and masons ' tools garden tools welding equipment chainsaws fiberglass materials and so on even early personal computers The designer J Baldwin acted as editor to include such items writing many of the reviews The Catalog' s publication both emerged from and spurred the great wave of experimentalism convention-breaking and do-it-yourself attitude of the late 1960s Often copied the Catalog appealed to a wide cross-section of people in North America and had a broad influence DIY home improvement books burgeoned in the 1970s first created as collections of magazine articles An early extensive line of DIY how-to books was created by Sunset Books based upon previously published articles from their magazine Sunset based in California Time-Life Better Homes and Gardens and other publishers soon followed suit Electronics World   home assembled amplifier In the mid-1990s DIY home-improvement content began to find its way onto the World Wide Web HouseNet was the earliest bulletin-board style site where users could share information HomeTips com established in early   was among the first Web-based sites to deliver free extensive DIY home-improvement content created by expert authors citation needed Since the late 1990s DIY has exploded on the Web through thousands of sites In the 1970s when home video VCRs came along DIY instructors quickly grasped its potential for demonstrating processes by audio-visual means In   the PBS television series This Old House starring Bob Vila premiered and this spurred a DIY television revolution The show was immensely popular educating people on how to improve their living conditions and the value of their house without the expense of paying someone else to do as much of the work In   the HGTV Network cable television channel was launched in the United States and Canada followed in   by the DIY Network cable television channel Both were launched to appeal to the growing percentage of North Americans interested in DIY topics from home improvement to knitting Such channels have multiple shows showing how to stretch one's budget to achieve professional-looking results Design Cents Design on a Dime etc while doing the work yourself Toolbelt Diva specifically caters to female DIYers Beyond magazines and television the scope of home improvement DIY continues to grow online where most mainstream media outlets now have extensive DIY-focused informational websites such as This Old House Martha Stewart Hometalk and the DIY Network These are often extensions of their magazine or television brand The growth of independent online DIY resources is also spiking   The number of homeowners who blog about their experiences continues to grow along with DIY websites from smaller organizations Fashion edit Mennonite farmer's wife dressmaking   DIY amongst the fashion community is popular with ideas being shared on social media such as YouTube about clothing jewellery makeup and hair styles Techniques include distressing jeans bleaching jeans redesigning an old shirt and studding denim This trend is becoming popular Subculture edit

mixing robot DIY as a subculture could be said to have begun with the punk movement of the 1970s   Instead of traditional means of bands reaching their audiences through large music labels bands began recording manufacturing albums and merchandise booking their own tours and creating opportunities for smaller bands to get wider recognition and gain cult status through repetitive low-cost DIY touring The burgeoning zine movement took up coverage of and promotion of the underground punk scenes and significantly altered the way fans interacted with musicians Zines quickly branched off from being hand-made music magazines to become more personal they quickly became one of the youth culture's gateways to DIY culture This led to tutorial zines showing others how to make their own shirts

open-design movement edit Sharing of manufacturing information can be traced back to the 18th and 19th century     Aggressive patenting put an end to that period of extensive knowledge sharing   More recently principles of open design have been related to the free software and open source movements   In   Eric S Raymond Tim O'Reilly and Larry Augustin established \"open source\" as an alternative expression to \"free software \" and in   Bruce Perens published the Open Source Definition In late   Dr Sepehr Kiani a PhD in mechanical engineering from MIT realized that designers could benefit from open source policies and in early   he convinced Dr Ryan Vallance and Dr Samir Nayfeh of the potential benefits of open design in machine design applications   Together they established the Open Design Foundation ODF as a non-profit corporation and set out to develop an Open Design Definition   The idea of open design was taken up either simultaneously or subsequently by several other groups and individuals The principles of open design are closely similar to those of open-source hardware design which emerged in March   when Reinoud Lamberts of the Delft University of Technology proposed on his Open Design Circuits website the creation of a hardware design community in the spirit of free software   Ronen Kadushin coined the title \"Open Design\" in his   Master s thesis and the term was later formalized in the   Open Design Manifesto   Current directions of the open-design movement edit Play media Open Source Ecology open source farming and industrial machinery The open-design movement currently unites two trends On one hand people apply their skills and time on projects for the common good perhaps where funding or commercial interest is lacking for developing countries or to help spread ecological or cheaper technologies On the other hand open design may provide a framework for developing advanced projects and technologies that might be beyond the resource of any single company or country and involve people who without the copyleft mechanism might not collaborate otherwise There is now also a third trend where these two methods come together to use high-tech open-source e g 3D printing but customized local solutions for sustainable development   Open Design holds great potential in driving future innovation as resent research has proven that stakeholder users working together produce more innovative designs than designers consulting users through more traditional means   Open machine design as compared to open-source software edit The open-design movement is currently fairly nascent but holds great potential for the future In some respects design and engineering are even more suited to open collaborative development than the increasingly common open-source software projects because with 3D models and photographs the concept can often be understood visually It is not even necessary that the project members speak the same languages to usefully collaborate However there are certain barriers to overcome for open design when compared to software development where there are mature and widely used tools available and the duplication and distribution of code cost next to nothing Creating testing and modifying physical designs is not quite so straightforward because of the effort time and cost required to create the physical artefact although with access to emerging flexible computer-controlled manufacturing techniques the complexity and effort of construction can be significantly reduced see tools mentioned in the fab lab article Open-design organizations edit VIA OpenBook reference design CAD visualisation Open design is currently a fledgling movement consisting of several unrelated or loosely related initiatives   Many of these organizations are single funded projects while a few organizations are focusing on an area needing development In some cases e g Thingiverse for 3D printable designs or Appropedia for open

Definition edit A   survey of literature on innovation found over   definitions In an industrial survey of how the software industry defined innovation the following definition given by Crossan and Apaydin was considered to be the most complete which builds on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD manual's definition   Innovation is production or adoption assimilation and exploitation of a value-added novelty in economic and social spheres renewal and enlargement of products services and markets development of new methods of production and establishment of new management systems It is both a process and an outcome According to Kanter innovation includes original invention and creative use and defines innovation as a generation admission and realization of new ideas products services and processes   Two main dimensions of innovation were degree of novelty patent i e whether an innovation is new to the firm new to the market new to the industry or new to the world and type of innovation i e whether it is process or product-service system innovation   Inter-disciplinary views edit Business and economics edit   innovation economics In business and in economics innovation can become a catalyst for growth With rapid advancements in transportation and communications over the past few decades the old-world concepts of factor endowments and comparative advantage which focused on an area's unique inputs are outmoded for today's global economy Economist Joseph Schumpeter 1883-1950 who contributed greatly to the study of innovation economics argued that industries must incessantly revolutionize the economic structure from within that is innovate with better or more effective processes and products as well as market distribution such as the connection from the craft shop to factory He famously asserted that \" creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism \"   Entrepreneurs continuously look for better ways to satisfy their consumer base with improved quality durability service and price which come to fruition in innovation with advanced technologies and organizational strategies   need quotation to verify A prime example of innovation involved the explosive boom of Silicon Valley startups out of the Stanford Industrial Park In   dissatisfied employees of Shockley Semiconductor the company of Nobel laureate and co-inventor of the transistor William Shockley left to form an independent firm Fairchild Semiconductor After several years Fairchild developed into a formidable presence in the sector Eventually these founders left to start their own companies based on their own unique latest ideas and then leading employees started their own firms Over the next   years this snowball process launched the momentous startup-company explosion of information-technology firms Essentially Silicon Valley began as   new enterprises born out of Shockley's eight former employees   Since then hubs of innovation have sprung up globally with similar metonyms including Silicon Alley encompassing New York City Another example involves business incubators - a phenomenon nurtured by governments around the world close to knowledge clusters mostly research-based like universities or other Government Excellence Centres - which aim primarily to channel generated knowledge to applied innovation outcomes in order to stimulate regional or national economic growth   Organizations edit In the organizational context innovation may be linked to positive changes in efficiency productivity quality competitiveness and market share However recent research findings highlight the complementary role of organizational culture in enabling organizations to translate innovative activity into tangible performance improvements   Organizations can also improve profits and performance by providing work groups opportunities and resources to innovate in addition to employee's core job tasks   Peter Drucker wrote Innovation is the specific function of entrepreneurship whether in an existing business a public service institution or a new venture started by a lone individual in the family kitchen It is the means by which the entrepreneur either creates new wealth-producing resources or endows existing resources with enhanced potential for creating wealth Drucker   According to Clayton Christensen disruptive innovation is the key to future success in business   The organisation requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage It is necessary to create and nurture an environment of innovation Executives and managers need to break away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage It is a time of risk but even greater opportunity   The world of work is changing with the increase in the use of technology and both companies and businesses are becoming increasingly competitive Companies will have to downsize and re-engineer their operations to remain competitive This will affect employment as businesses will be forced to reduce the number of people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more   While disruptive innovation will typically \"attack a traditional business model with a lower-cost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly \"   foundational innovation is slower and typically has the potential to create new foundations for global technology systems over the longer term Foundational innovation tends to transform business operating models as entirely new business models emerge over many years with gradual and steady adoption of the innovation leading to waves of technological and institutional change that gain momentum more slowly   The advent of the packet-switched communication protocol TCP/IP originally introduced in   to support a single use case for United States Department of Defense electronic communication email and which gained widespread adoption only in the mid-1990s with the advent of the World Wide Web is a foundational technology   All organizations can innovate including for example hospitals universities and local governments   For instance former Mayor Martin O Malley pushed the City of Baltimore to use CitiStat a performance-measurement data and management system that allows city officials to maintain statistics on several areas from crime trends to the conditions of pothole s This system aids in better evaluation of policies and procedures with accountability and efficiency in terms of time and money In its first year CitiStat saved the city $13   million   Even mass transit systems have innovated with hybrid bus fleets to real-time tracking at bus stands In addition the growing use of mobile data terminals in vehicles that serve as communication hubs between vehicles and a control center automatically send data on location passenger counts engine performance mileage and other information This tool helps to deliver and manage transportation systems   Still other innovative strategies include hospitals digitizing medical information in electronic medical records For example the U S Department of Housing and Urban Development 's HOPE VI initiatives turned severely distressed public housing in urban areas into revitalized mixed-income environments the Harlem Children s Zone used a community-based approach to educate local area children and the Environmental Protection Agency 's brownfield grants facilitates turning over brownfields for environmental protection green spaces community and commercial development Sources edit There are several sources of innovation It can occur as a result of a focus effort by a range of different agents by chance or as a result of a major system failure According to Peter F Drucker the general sources of innovations are different changes in industry structure in market structure in local and global demographics in human perception mood and meaning in the amount of already available scientific knowledge etc   Original model of three phases of the process of Technological Change In the simplest linear model of innovation the traditionally recognized source is manufacturer innovation This is where an agent person or business innovates in order to sell the innovation Specifically R&D measurement is the commonly used input for innovation in particular in the business sector named Business Expenditure on R&D BERD that grew over the years on the expenses of the declining R&D invested by the public sector   Another source of innovation only now becoming widely recognized is end-user innovation This is where an agent person or company develops an innovation for their own personal or in-house use because existing products do not meet their needs MIT economist Eric von Hippel has identified end-user innovation as by far the most important and critical in his classic book on the subject The Sources of Innovation   The robotics engineer Joseph F Engelberger asserts that innovations require only three things A recognized need Competent people with relevant technology and Financial support   However innovation processes usually involve identifying customer needs macro and meso trends developing competences and finding financial support The Kline chain-linked model of innovation   places emphasis on potential market needs as drivers of the innovation process and describes the complex and often iterative feedback loops between marketing design manufacturing and R&D Innovation by businesses is achieved in many ways with much attention now given to formal research and development R&D for \"breakthrough innovations\" R&D help spur on patents and other scientific innovations that leads to productive growth in such areas as industry medicine engineering and government   Yet innovations can be developed by less formal on-the-job modifications of practice through exchange and combination of professional experience and by many other routes Investigation of relationship between the concepts of innovation and technology transfer revealed overlap   The more radical and revolutionary innovations tend to emerge from R&D while more incremental innovations may emerge from practice but there are many exceptions to each of these trends Information technology and changing business processes and management style can produce a work climate favorable to innovation   For example the software tool company Atlassian conducts quarterly \"ShipIt Days\" in which employees may work on anything related to the company's products   Google employees work on self-directed projects for 20% of their time known as Innovation Time Off Both companies cite these bottom-up processes as major sources for new products and features An important innovation factor includes customers buying products or using services As a result firms may incorporate users in focus groups user centred approach work closely with so called lead users lead user approach or users might adapt their products themselves The lead user method focuses on idea generation based on leading users to develop breakthrough innovations U-STIR a project to innovate Europe s surface transportation system employs such workshops   Regarding this user innovation a great deal of innovation is done by those actually implementing and using technologies and products as part of their normal activities Sometimes user-innovators may become entrepreneurs selling their product they may choose to trade their innovation in exchange for other innovations or they may be adopted by their suppliers Nowadays they may also choose to freely reveal their innovations using methods like open source In such networks of innovation the users or communities of users can further develop technologies and reinvent their social meaning     One technique for innovating a solution to an identified problem is to actually attempt an experiment with many possibile solutions   This technique was famously used by Thomas Edison's laboratory to find a version of the incandescent light bulb economically viable for home use which involved searching through thousands of possible filament designs before settling on carbonized bamboo This technique is sometimes used in pharmaceutical drug discovery Thousands of chemical compounds are subjected to high-throughput screening to see if they have any activity against a target molecule which has been identified as biologically significant to a disease Promising compounds can then be studied modified to improve efficacy reduce side effects and reduce cost of manufacture and if successful turned into treatments The related technique of A/B testing is often used to help optimize the design of web sites and mobile apps This is used by major sites such as amazon com Facebook Google and Netflix   Procter & Gamble uses computer-simulated products and onlinen user panels to conduct larger numbers of experiments to guide the design packaging and shelf placement of consumer products   Capital One uses this technique to drive credit card marketing offers   Goals and failures edit Programs of organizational innovation are typically tightly linked to organizational goals and objectives to the business plan and to market competitive positioning One driver for innovation programs in corporations is to achieve growth objectives As Davila et al   notes \"Companies cannot grow through cost reduction and reengineering alone Innovation is the key element in providing aggressive top-line growth and for increasing bottom-line results\"   One survey across a large number of manufacturing and services organizations found ranked in decreasing order of popularity that systematic programs of organizational innovation are most frequently driven by improved quality creation of new markets extension of the product range reduced labor costs improved production processes reduced materials reduced environmental damage replacement of products / services reduced energy consumption conformance to regulations   These goals vary between improvements to products processes and services and dispel a popular myth that innovation deals mainly with new product development Most of the goals could apply to any organisation be it a manufacturing facility marketing firm hospital or local government Whether innovation goals are successfully achieved or otherwise depends greatly on the environment prevailing in the firm   Conversely failure can develop in programs of innovations The causes of failure have been widely researched and can vary considerably Some causes will be external to the organization and outside its influence of control Others will be internal and ultimately within the control of the organization Internal causes of failure can be divided into causes associated with the cultural infrastructure and causes associated with the innovation process itself Common causes of failure within the innovation process in most organizations can be distilled into five types poor goal definition poor alignment of actions to goals poor participation in teams poor monitoring of results poor communication and access to information   Diffusion edit   Diffusion of innovations Diffusion of innovation research was first started in   by seminal researcher Gabriel Tarde who first plotted the S-shaped diffusion curve Tarde defined the innovation-decision process as a series of steps that includes   First knowledge Forming an attitude A decision to adopt or reject Implementation and use Confirmation of the decision Once innovation occurs innovations may be spread from the innovator to other individuals and groups This process has been proposed that the life cycle of innovations can be described using the ' s-curve ' or diffusion curve The s-curve maps growth of revenue or productivity against time In the early stage of a particular innovation growth is relatively slow as the new product establishes itself At some point customers begin to demand and the product growth increases more rapidly New incremental innovations or changes to the product allow growth to continue Towards the end of its lifecycle growth slows and may even begin to decline In the later stages no amount of new investment in that product will yield a normal rate of return The s-curve derives from an assumption that new products are likely to have \"product life\" i e a start-up phase a rapid increase in revenue and eventual decline In fact the great majority of innovations never get off the bottom of the curve and never produce normal returns Innovative companies will typically be working on new innovations that will eventually replace older ones Successive s-curves will come along to replace older ones and continue to drive growth upwards In the figure above the first curve shows a current technology The second shows an emerging technology that currently yields lower growth but will eventually overtake current technology and lead to even greater levels of growth The length of life will depend on many factors   Measures edit Measuring innovation is inherently difficult as it implies commensurability so that comparisons can be made in quantitative terms Innovation however is by definition novelty Comparisons are thus often meaningless across products or service   Nevertheless Edison et al   in their review of literature on innovation management found   innovation metrics They categorized these measures along five dimensions i e inputs to the innovation process output from the innovation process effect of the innovation output measures to access the activities in an innovation process and availability of factors that facilitate such a process   There are two different types of measures for innovation the organizational level and the political level Organizational level edit The measure of innovation at the organizational level relates to individuals team-level assessments and private companies from the smallest to the largest company Measure of innovation for organizations can be conducted by surveys workshops consultants or internal benchmarking There is today no established general way to measure organizational innovation Corporate measurements are generally structured around balanced scorecards which cover several aspects of innovation such as business measures related to finances innovation process efficiency employees' contribution and motivation as well benefits for customers Measured values will vary widely between businesses covering for example new product revenue spending in R&D time to market customer and employee perception & satisfaction number of patents additional sales resulting from past innovations   Political level edit For the political level measures of innovation are more focused on a country or region competitive advantage through innovation In this context organizational capabilities can be evaluated through various evaluation frameworks such as those of the European Foundation for Quality Management The OECD Oslo Manual   suggests standard guidelines on measuring technological product and process innovation Some people consider the Oslo Manual complementary to the Frascati Manual from   The new Oslo manual from   takes a wider perspective to innovation and includes marketing and organizational innovation These standards are used for example in the European Community Innovation Surveys   Other ways of measuring innovation have traditionally been expenditure for example investment in R&D Research and Development as percentage of GNP Gross National Product Whether this is a good measurement of innovation has been widely discussed and the Oslo Manual has incorporated some of the critique against earlier methods of measuring The traditional methods of measuring still inform many policy decisions The EU Lisbon Strategy has set as a goal that their average expenditure on R&D should be 3% of GDP   Indicators edit Many scholars claim that there is a great bias towards the \"science and technology mode\" S&T-mode or STI-mode while the \"learning by doing using and interacting mode\" DUI-mode is ignored and measurements and research about it rarely done For example an institution may be high tech with the latest equipment but lacks crucial doing using and interacting tasks important for innovation citation needed A common industry view unsupported by empirical evidence is that comparative cost-effectiveness research is a form of price control which reduces returns to industry and thus limits R&D expenditure stifles future innovation and compromises new products access to markets   Some academics claim cost-effectiveness research is a valuable value-based measure of innovation which accords \"truly significant\" therapeutic advances i e providing \"health gain\" higher prices than free market mechanisms   Such value-based pricing has been viewed as a means of indicating to industry the type of innovation that should be rewarded from the public purse   An Australian academic developed the case that national comparative cost-effectiveness analysis systems should be viewed as measuring \"health innovation\" as an evidence-based policy concept for valuing innovation distinct from valuing through competitive markets a method which requires strong anti-trust laws to be effective on the basis that both methods of assessing pharmaceutical innovations are mentioned in annex 2C   of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement       Indices edit Several indices attempt to measure innovation and rank entities based on these measures such as The Bloomberg Innovation Index The \"Bogota Manual\"   similar to the Oslo Manual is focused on Latin America and the Caribbean countries citation needed The \"Creative Class\" developed by Richard Florida citation needed The EIU Innovation Ranking The Global Competitiveness Report The Global Innovation Index GII by INSEAD   The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation ITIF Index Innovation   - From the World Bank Aggregates innovation indicators and more from a number of different public sources The Innovation Capacity Index ICI published by a large number of international professors working in a collaborative fashion The top scorers of ICI     were   Sweden       Finland     and   United States       The Innovation Index developed by the Indiana Business Research Center to measure innovation capacity at the county or regional level in the United States   The Innovation Union Scoreboard The innovationsindikator for Germany developed by the Federation of German Industries Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie in     The INSEAD Innovation Efficacy Index   The International Innovation Index produced jointly by The Boston Consulting Group the National Association of Manufacturers and its nonpartisan research affiliate The Manufacturing Institute is a worldwide index measuring the level of innovation in a country NAM describes it as the \"largest and most comprehensive global index of its kind\" citation needed The Management Innovation Index - Model for Managing Intangibility of Organizational Creativity Management Innovation Index   The NYCEDC Innovation Index by the New York City Economic Development Corporation tracks New York City s \"transformation into a center for high-tech innovation It measures innovation in the City s growing science and technology industries and is designed to capture the effect of innovation on the City s economy \"   The Oslo Manual is focused on North America Europe and other rich economies The State Technology and Science Index developed by the Milken Institute is a U S -wide benchmark to measure the science and technology capabilities that furnish high paying jobs based around key components   The World Competitiveness Scoreboard   Rankings edit Many research studies try to rank countries based on measures of innovation Common areas of focus include high-tech companies manufacturing patents post secondary education research and development and research personnel The left ranking of the top   countries below is based on the   Bloomberg Innovation Index   However studies may vary widely for example the Global Innovation Index   ranks Switzerland as

Warfare Center argued on the basis of both U S patents and world technological breakthroughs per capita that the rate of human technological innovation peaked in   and has been slowing ever since     In his article he asked \"Will the level of technology reach a maximum and then decline as in the Dark Ages?\"   In later comments to New Scientist magazine Huebner clarified that while he believed that we will reach a rate of innovation in   equivalent to that of the Dark Ages he was not predicting the reoccurrence of the Dark Ages themselves   John Smart criticized the claim and asserted that technological singularity researcher Ray Kurzweil and others showed a \"clear trend of acceleration not deceleration\" when it came to innovations   The foundation replied to Huebner the journal his article was published in citing Second Life and eHarmony as proof of accelerating innovation to which Huebner replied   However Huebner's findings were confirmed in   with U S Patent Office data   and in a   paper   Innovation and Development edit The theme of innovation as a tool to disrupting patterns of poverty has gained momentum since the mid-2000s among major international development actors such as DFID   Gates Foundation 's use of the Grand Challenge funding model   and USAID 's Global Development Lab   Networks have been established to support innovation in development such as D-Lab at MIT   Investment funds have been established to identify and catalyze innovations in developing countries such as DFID's Global Innovation Fund   Human Development Innovation Fund   and in partnership with USAID the Global Development Innovation Ventures   Innovation as a tool for development is usually focused on developing countries but a burgeoning literature has relevance for innovation as a tool for development in developed countries too particularly with respect to poverty works have largely focused on innovation and poverty indirectly by employing variables associated with poverty rather than poverty itself Indeed Bell Alex Raj Chetty Xavier Jaravel Neviana Petkova & John Van Reenen   studied the links between patent tax and school district records of inventors in the US and noted a negative association between poverty and the likelihood of becoming an inventor Aghion Philippe Ufuk Akcigit Ari Hyytinen & Otto Toivanen   studied the factors associated with becoming an inventor in Finland and found that parental income and education and innate ability or IQ increased the likelihood of becoming an inventor Akcigit Ufuk John Grisby & Tom Nicholas   utilized both micro and macro data to identify factors associated with becoming an inventor in the US and reaffirmed the importance of parental income and education especially the father s Additional micro factors however were the inventor s education and having migrated from his or her state of birth Focusing strictly on macro data Hall & Howell-Moroney   found a negative association between state-level innovation capacity and poverty Recent research has reaffirmed these findings but by discerning a significant and negative association between county poverty rates and county patent counts across the US between 2008-2014 Government policies edit Given the noticeable effects on efficiency quality of life and productive growth innovation is a key factor in society and economy Consequently policymakers have long worked to develop environments that will foster innovation and its resulting positive benefits from funding Research and Development to supporting regulatory change funding the development of innovation clusters and using public purchasing and standardisation to 'pull' innovation through For instance experts are advocating that the U S federal government launch a National Infrastructure Foundation a nimble collaborative strategic intervention organization that will house innovations programs from fragmented silos under one entity inform federal officials on innovation performance metrics strengthen industry-university partnerships and support innovation economic development initiatives especially to strengthen regional clusters Because clusters are the geographic incubators of innovative products and processes a cluster development grant program would also be targeted for implementation By focusing on innovating in such areas as precision manufacturing information technology and clean energy other areas of national concern would be tackled including government debt carbon footprint and oil dependence   The U S Economic Development Administration understand this reality in their continued Regional Innovation Clusters initiative   In addition federal grants in R&D a crucial driver of innovation and productive growth should be expanded to levels similar to Japan Finland South Korea and Switzerland in order to stay globally competitive Also such grants should be better procured to metropolitan areas the essential engines of the American economy   Many countries recognize the importance of research and development as well as innovation including Japan's Ministry of Education Culture Sports Science and Technology MEXT   Germany s Federal Ministry of Education and Research   and the Ministry of Science and Technology in the People's Republic of China Furthermore Russia's innovation programme is the Medvedev modernisation programme which aims at creating a diversified economy based on high technology and innovation Also the Government of Western Australia has established a number of innovation incentives for government

originated with the start of communication in prehistoric times Trading was the main facility of prehistoric people who bartered goods and services with each other when there was no such thing as modern day currency Peter Watson dates the history of long-distance commerce from circa     years ago   Trade exists for many reasons Due to specialisation and division of labor most people concentrate on a small aspect of production trading for other products Trade exists between regions because different regions have a comparative advantage in the production of some tradable commodity or because different regions' size allows for the benefits of mass production As such trade at market prices between locations benefits both locations Community organization Intentional Community edit

entire colony in a common long room Oneida Community Oneida New York   The Oneida Community practiced Communalism in the sense of communal property and possessions and Mutual Criticism where every member of the community was subject to criticism by committee or the community as a whole during a general meeting The goal was to eliminate bad character traits Early Kibbutz settlements founded near Jerusalem   A Kibbutz is an Israeli collective community The movement combines socialism and Zionism in a form of practical Labor Zionism founded at a time when independent farming was not practical or perhaps more correctly not practicable Forced by necessity into communal life and inspired by their own ideology the kibbutz members developed a pure communal mode of living that attracted interest from the entire world While the kibbutzim lasted for several generations as utopian communities most of today's kibbutzim are scarcely different from the capitalist enterprises and regular towns to which the kibbutzim were originally supposed to be alternatives citation needed Indigenous Collaboration edit See also Yui disambiguation needed |Yui &   disambiguation needed disambiguation needed Collaboration in indigenous communities particularly in the Americas often includes the entire community working toward a common goal in a horizontal structure with flexible leadership   Children in some Indigenous American communities work fluidly to collaborate with the rest of the community They are allowed and want to participate freely with the adults Children can be contributors in the process of meeting objectives by taking on tasks that suit their skills   Indigenous learning techniques comprise Learning by Observing and Pitching In For example a study of Mayan fathers and children with traditional Indigenous ways of learning worked together in collaboration more frequently when building a 3D model puzzle then Mayan fathers with western schooling   Also Chillihuani people of the Andes value work and create work parties in which members of each household in the community participate   Children from indigenous-heritage communities want to help around the house voluntarily   In the Mazahua Indigenous community of Mexico school children show initiative and autonomy by contributing in their classroom completing activities as a whole assisting and correcting their teacher during lectures when a mistake is made   Fifth and sixth graders in the community work with the teacher installing a classroom window the installation becomes a class project in which the students participate in the process alongside the teacher They all work together without needing leadership and their movements are all in sync and flowing It is not a process of instruction but rather a hands-on experience in which students work together as a synchronous group with the teacher switching roles and sharing tasks In these communities collaboration is emphasized and learners are trusted to take initiative While one works the other watches intently and all are allowed to attempt tasks with the more experienced stepping in to complete more complex parts while others pay close attention   Collaboration under capitalism edit Ayn Rand utterly rejected the notion that one should live an isolated life She recognized that a crucial way we develop ourselves and pursue our rational self-interest is by building strong relationships with other people whether in business friendship romance or any other kind of life-serving relationship Rand wrote hundreds of pages about the virtues and benefits of collaborating with others to mutual advantage She also recognized that as participants in capitalism we re all connected through the voluntary division of labor in the free market where value is exchanged always for value In presenting her theory of rational egoism Rand explained why acting in one s self-interests often entails looking out for others to protect the innocent from injustice to aid our friends and allies and to protect and support our friends and loved ones   Game theory edit This section does not cite any sources Please help improve this section

among a nation's armed forces its private industry and associated political and commercial interests In such a system the military is dependent on industry to supply material and other support while the defense industry depends on government for revenue Skunk Works Skunk Works is a term used in engineering and technical fields to describe a group within an organization given a high degree of autonomy and unhampered by bureaucracy tasked with working on advanced or secret projects Founded at Lockheed in   the team developed highly innovative aircraft in short time frames even beating its first deadline by   days   Creator of the organization Kelly Johnson is said to have been an 'organizing genius' and had fourteen basic operating rules   Manhattan Project The Manhattan Project was the project to develop the first nuclear weapon atomic bomb during World War II by the United States the United Kingdom and Canada Formally designated as the Manhattan Engineer District it refers specifically to the period of the project from     under the control of the U S Army Corps of Engineers under the administration of General Leslie R Groves The scientific research was directed by American physicist J Robert Oppenheimer While the aforementioned persons were influential in the project itself the value of this project as an influence on organized collaboration is better attributed to Vannevar Bush   In early   Bush lobbied for the creation of the National Defense Research Committee Frustrated by previous bureaucratic failures in implementing technology in World War I Bush sought to organize the scientific power of the United States for greater success   The project succeeded in developing and detonating three nuclear weapons in   a test detonation of a plutonium implosion bomb on July   the Trinity test near Alamogordo New Mexico an enriched uranium bomb code-named \" Little Boy \" on August   over Hiroshima Japan and a second plutonium bomb code-named \" Fat Man \" on August   over Nagasaki Japan Project management edit The     Liberty ships built in four years by the United States during World War II required new approaches in organization and manufacturing As a discipline Project Management developed from different fields of application including construction engineering and defense In the United States the forefather of project management is Henry Gantt called the father of planning and control techniques who is famously known for his use of the \"bar\" chart as a project management tool for being an associate of Frederick Winslow Taylor 's theories of scientific management and for his study of the work and management of Navy ship building His work is the forerunner to many modern project management tools including the work breakdown structure WBS and resource allocation The 1950s marked the beginning of the modern project management era Again in the United States prior to the 1950s projects were managed on an ad hoc basis using mostly Gantt charts and informal techniques and tools At that time two mathematical project scheduling models were developed   the \" Program Evaluation and Review Technique \" or PERT developed as part of the United States Navy 's in conjunction with the Lockheed Corporation Polaris missile submarine program   and   the \" Critical Path Method \" CPM developed in a joint venture by both DuPont Corporation and Remington Rand Corporation for managing plant maintenance projects These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises In   the Project Management Institute PMI was formed to serve the interest of the project management industry The premise of PMI is that the tools and techniques of project management are common even among the widespread application of projects from the software industry to the construction industry In   the PMI Board of Directors authorized the development of what has become A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge PMBOK standards and guidelines of practice that are widely used throughout the profession The International Project Management Association IPMA founded in Europe in   has undergone a similar development and instituted the IPMA Project Baseline Both organizations are now participating in the development of a global project management standard Academia edit Black Mountain College Founded in   by John Andrew Rice Theodore Dreier and other former faculty of Rollins College Black Mountain was experimental by nature and committed to an interdisciplinary approach attracting a faculty which included many of America's leading visual artists poets and designers Operating in a relatively isolated rural location with little budget Black Mountain College inculcated an informal and collaborative spirit and over its lifetime attracted a venerable roster of instructors Some of the innovations relationships and unexpected connections formed at Black Mountain would prove to have a lasting influence on the postwar American art scene high culture and eventually pop culture Buckminster Fuller met student Kenneth Snelson at Black Mountain and the result was the first geodesic dome improvised out of slats in the school's back yard Merce Cunningham formed his dance company and John Cage staged his first happening Not a haphazardly conceived venture Black Mountain College was a consciously directed liberal arts school that grew out of the progressive education movement In its day it was a unique educational experiment for the artists and writers who conducted it and as such an important incubator for the American avant garde Black Mountain proved to be an important precursor to and prototype for many of the alternative colleges of today ranging from the University of California Santa Cruz to Hampshire College and Evergreen State College among others Learning Community The Evergreen signature clock tower Dr Wolff-Michael Roth and Stuart Lee of the University of Victoria assert   that until the early 1990s the individual was the 'unit of instruction' and the focus of research The two observed that researchers and practitioners switched     to the idea that knowing is 'better' thought of as a cultural practice         Roth and Lee also claim   that this led to changes in learning and teaching design in which students were encouraged to share their ways of doing mathematics history science with each other In other words that children take part in the construction of consensual domains and 'participate in the negotiation and institutionalization of meaning' In effect they are participating in learning communities This analysis does not take account of the appearance of Learning communities in the United States in the early 1980s For example The Evergreen State College which is widely considered a pioneer in this area established an intercollegiate learning community in   In   this same college established The Washington Center for Improving

romanticized notion of a lone genius artist has existed since the time of Giorgio Vasari s Lives of the Artists published in   Vasari promulgated the idea that artistic skill was endowed upon chosen individuals by gods which created an enduring and largely false popular misunderstanding of many artistic processes Artists have used collaboration to complete large scale works for centuries but the myth of the lone artist was not questioned by the public consciousness until the 1960s and 1970s   Collaborative art groups edit Dada   Fluxus   Situationist International   Experiments in Art and

Hypothetically one person could control all of this But most often every work of ballet is the by-product of collaboration From the earliest formal works of ballet to the great 19th century masterpieces of Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Marius Petipa to the 20th century masterworks of George Balanchine and Igor Stravinsky to today s ballet companies feature strong collaborative connections between choreographers composers and costume designers are essential Within dance as an art form there is also the collaboration between choreographer and dancer The choreographer creates a movement in her/his head and then physically demonstrates the movement to the dancer which the dancer sees and attempts to either mimic or interpret - two or more people striving for a connected goal Business edit Collaboration in business can be found both inter- and intra-organization   and ranges from the simplicity of a partnership and crowd funding to the complexity of a multinational corporation Inter-organizational collaboration depicts relationship between two or several organizations in which the participating parties agree to invest resources mutually achieve goals share information resources rewards and responsibilities as well as jointly make decisions and solve problems   Collaboration between public private and voluntary sectors can be effective in tackling complex policy problems but may be handled more effectively by committed boundary-spanning teams and networks than by formal organizational structures   Collaboration between team members allows for better communication within the organization and throughout the supply chains It is a way of coordinating different ideas from numerous people to generate a wide variety of knowledge Collaboration with a selected few firms as opposed to collaboration with a large number of different firms has been shown to positively impact firm performance and innovation outcomes   The recent improvement in technology has provided the world with high speed internet wireless connection and web-based collaboration tools like blogs and wikis and has as such created a \" mass collaboration \" People from all over the world are efficiently able to communicate and share ideas through the internet or even conferences without any geographical barriers The power of social networks is beginning to permeate into business culture where many collaborative uses are being found including file sharing and knowledge transfer Evan Rosen the author of The Culture of Collaboration defines collaboration as \"working together to create value while sharing virtual or physical space \"   According to Rosen command-and-control organizational structures inhibit collaboration and replacing these obsolete structures allows collaboration to flourish     Management cybernetics A plethora of studies have shown that collaboration can be a powerful tool towards higher achievement and increased productivity since collective efficacy can significantly boost groups aspirations motivational investment morale and resilience to challenges   However a four-year study of interorganizational collaboration found that successful collaboration can be rapidly derailed through external policy steering particularly where it undermines relations built on trust     On a more specific level coworking spaces are businesses

used models of collaboration found in classrooms across all grade levels and content areas   Once only regarded as collaboration between special education and general education teachers it is now more generally defined as two professionals delivering substantive instruction to a diverse group of students in a single physical space \"   As classrooms have become increasingly diverse so too have the challenges for educators Due to the diverse needs of students with designated special needs English languages learners ELL and students of varied academic levels teachers have been led to develop new approaches that provide additional support for their students   In practice this is an inclusive model where students are not removed from the classroom to receive separate instruction but rather they remain and receive collaborative instruction by both their general teacher and special education teachers   Societal changes that have taken place over the past few decades allows new ways of conceptualizing collaboration and to understand the evolution and expansion of these types of relationships For example economic changes that have taken place domestically and internationally have resulted in the transformation from an industry-dependent economy to an information-centered economy that is dependent on new technologies and expansion of industries that provide services   From an educational standpoint such transformations were projected through federal reports such as A Nation at Risk in   and What Matters Most Teaching for America s Future in   In these reports economic success could be assured if students developed the capacity to learn how to manage teams and work together successfully in teams   The continuing development of Web     technologies such as wikis blogs multiplayer games online communities and Twitter among others has changed the manner in which students communicate and collaborate Teachers are increasingly using collaborative software to establish virtual learning environments VLEs This allows them to share learning materials and feedback with both students and in some cases parents citation needed   Collaborative Partnerships

occurs when musicians in different places or groups work on the same album or song Typically in today's music word multiple parties are involved singers songwriters lyrisits composers and producers come together to create one song For example one specific collaboration from recent times   was the song \" FourFiveSeconds \" This single represents a type of collaboration because it is a form of art that was developed by multiple artists with the inclusion of Rihanna a recent pop idol Paul McCartney former guitarist and vocalist for the Beatles and Kanye West a currently popular rapper Collaboration between musicians especially with regards to jazz is often heralded as the epitome of complex collaborative practice Special websites as well as software have been created to facilitate musical collaboration over the Internet resulting in the emergence of Online Bands Several awards exist specifically for collaboration in music Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals awarded since   Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals awarded since   Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration awarded since   Collaboration has been a constant feature of Electroacoustic Music due to the complexity of the technology Since the beginning all laboratories and electronic music studios have involved the presence of different individuals with diverse but intertwined competencies In particular the embedding of technological tools into the process of musical creation resulted in the emergence of a new agent with new expertise the musical assistant the technician the tutor the computer music designer the music mediator a profession that has been described and defined in different ways over the years who can work in the phase of writing creating new instruments recording and/or performance He or she explains the possibilities of the various instruments and applications as well as the potential sound effects to the composer when the latter did not have sufficient knowledge of the programme or a clear idea of what he or she could obtain from it The musical assistant also explains the most recent results in musical research and translates artistic ideas into programming languages Finally he or she transforms those ideas into a score or a computer program and often performs the musical piece during the concerts   Examples of collaboration are numerous Pierre Boulez and Andrew Gerzso Alvise Vidolin and Luigi Nono Jonathan Harvey and Gilbert Nouno among others Entertainment edit Collaboration in entertainment is a relatively new phenomenon brought on with the advent of social media reality TV and video sharing sites such as YouTube and Vimeo Collaboration occurs when writers directors actors producers and other individuals or groups work on the same television show short film or feature-length film A revolutionary system has been developed by Will Wright for the production of the TV series title Bar Karma on CurrentTV Special web-based software titled Storymaker has been written to facilitate plot collaboration over the Internet Screenwriters' organizations bring together professional and amateur writers and filmmakers in a collaborative manner for entertainment development Publishing edit Collaboration in publishing can be as simple as dual-authorship or as complex as commons-based peer production Technological examples include Usenet e-mail lists blogs and Wikis while ' brick and mortar ' examples include monographs books and periodicals such as newspapers journals and magazines   Collaborative writing and Collaborative fiction Science edit Though there is no political institution organizing the sciences on an international level a self-organized global network had formed in the late 20th century   Observed by the rise in co-authorships in published papers Wagner and Leydesdorff found international collaborations to have doubled from   to     While collaborative authorships within nations has also risen this has done so at a slower rate and is not cited as frequently     Science     Medicine edit In medicine the physician assistant - physician relationship

Trilateral agreement between ESO the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Natural Sciences for the operation of ALMA   Due to the complexity of today's business environment collaboration in technology encompasses a broad range of tools that enable groups of people to work together including social networking instant messaging team spaces web sharing audio conferencing video and telephony Broadly defined any technology that facilitates linking of two or more humans to work together can be considered a collaborative tool Wikipedia Blogs even Twitter are collaborative tools Many large companies are developing enterprise collaboration strategies and standardize on collaboration platforms to allow employees customers and partners to intelligently connect and interact Enterprise collaboration tools are centered on attaining collective intelligence and staff collaboration at the organization level or with partners These include features such as staff networking expert recommendations information sharing expertise location peer feedback and real-time collaboration At the personal level this enables employees to enhance social awareness and their profiles and interactions Collaboration encompasses both asynchronous and synchronous methods of communication and serves as an umbrella term for a wide variety of software packages Perhaps the most commonly associated form of synchronous collaboration are web conferencing using tools but the term can easily be applied to IP telephony instant messaging and rich video interaction with telepresence as well The effectiveness of a collaborative effort is driven by three critical factors - Communication - Content Management - Workflow control The Internet The low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas knowledge and skills has made collaborative work dramatically easier Not only can a group cheaply communicate and test but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups to easily form in the first place even among niche interests An example of this is the free software movement in software development which produced GNU and Linux from scratch and has taken over development of Mozilla and OpenOffice org formerly known as Netscape Communicator and StarOffice Commons-based peer production Commons-based peer production is a term coined by Yale 's Law professor Yochai Benkler to describe a new model of economic production in which the creative energy of large numbers of people is coordinated usually with the aid of the internet into large meaningful projects mostly without traditional hierarchical organization or financial compensation He compares this to firm production where a centralized decision process decides what has to be done and by whom and market-based production when tagging different prices to different jobs serves as an attractor to anyone interested in doing the job Examples of products created by means of commons-based peer production include Linux a computer operating system Slashdot a news and announcements website Kuro5hin a discussion site for technology and culture Wikipedia an online encyclopedia and Clickworkers a collaborative scientific work Another example is Socialtext a software solution that uses tools such as wikis and weblogs and helps companies to create a collaborative work environment Massively distributed collaboration The term massively distributed collaboration was coined by Mitchell Kapor in a presentation at UC Berkeley on 2005-11-09 to describe an emerging activity of wikis and electronic mailing lists and blogs and other content-creating virtual communities online Wartime collaboration edit   Collaborationism Since World War II the term \"collaboration\" acquired a negative meaning as referring to persons and groups which help a foreign occupier of their country due to actual use by people in European countries who worked with and for the Nazi German occupiers Linguistically \"collaboration\" implies more or less equal partners who work together which was the meaning the Nazi German occupiers were suggesting for ideological reasons but was obviously not the case as one party was an army of occupation and the other were people of the occupied country living under the power of this army Thus the term \"collaboration\" acquired during World War II the additional sense of criminal deeds in the service of the occupying power including complicity with the occupying power in murder persecutions pillage and economic exploitation as well as participation in a puppet government The use of \"collaboration\" to mean \"traitorous cooperation with the enemy \" dates from   originally in reference to the Vichy Regime in France the French State civil servant and civilians who sympathised and participated in the Nazi Germany 's actions and voluntary troops LVF who fought against the Free French and later De Gaulle 's French Force Since then the words collaboration and collaborateur may have this very pejorative meaning in French and the abbreviation collabo has only this pejorative and insulting meaning Nonetheless collaboration and collaborateur have kept in French their original positive acceptations with for example collaborateur still commonly used in referring to co-workers In order to make a distinction the more specific term Collaborationism is often used for this phenomenon of collaboration with an occupying army However there is no water-tight distinction \"Collaboration\" and \"Collaborator\" as well as \"Collaborationism\" and \"Collaborationist\" are often used in this pejorative sense and even more so the equivalent terms in French and other languages spoken in countries which experienced direct Nazi occupation   edit Look up collaboration in

Valley billboard The maker culture is a contemporary culture or subculture representing a technology-based extension of DIY culture citation needed that intersects with hacker culture which is less concerned with physical objects as it focuses on software and revels in the creation of new devices as well as tinkering with existing ones The maker culture in general supports open-source hardware Typical interests enjoyed by the maker culture include engineering-oriented pursuits such as electronics robotics 3-D printing and the use of Computer Numeric Control tools as well as more traditional activities such as metalworking woodworking and mainly its predecessor the traditional arts and crafts The subculture stresses a cut-and-paste approach to standardized hobbyist technologies and encourages cookbook re-use of designs published on websites and maker-oriented publications     There is a strong focus on using and learning practical skills and applying them to reference designs

 Criticisms       References     Philosophical emphasis edit The maker movement is a social movement with an artisan spirit Maker culture emphasizes learning-through-doing active learning in a social environment Maker culture emphasizes informal networked peer-led and shared learning motivated by fun and self-fulfillment   Maker culture encourages novel applications of technologies and the exploration of intersections between traditionally separate domains and ways of working including metal-working calligraphy film making and computer programming Community interaction and knowledge sharing are often mediated through networked technologies with websites and social media tools forming the basis of knowledge repositories and a central channel for information sharing and exchange of ideas and focused through social meetings in shared spaces such as hackspaces Maker culture has attracted the interest of educators concerned about students disengagement from STEM subjects science technology engineering and mathematics in formal educational settings Maker culture is seen as having the potential to contribute to a more participatory approach and create new pathways into topics that will make them more alive and relevant to learners Some say that the maker movement is a reaction to the de-valuing of physical exploration and the growing sense of disconnection with the physical world in modern cities   Many products produced by the maker communities have a focus on health food sustainable development environmentalism and local culture and can from that point of view also be seen as a negative response to disposables globalised mass production the power of chain stores multinationals and consumerism In reaction to the rise of maker culture Barack Obama pledged to open several national research and development facilities to the public   In addition the U S federal government renamed one of their national centers \" America Makes \"   The methods of digital fabrication previously the exclusive domain of institutions have made making on a personal scale accessible following a logical and economic progression similar to the transition from minicomputers to personal computers in the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s   In   Dale Dougherty launched Make magazine to serve the growing community followed by the   launch of Maker Faire   The term coined by Dougherty grew into a full-fledged industry based on the growing number of DIYers who want to build something rather than buy it Spurred primarily by the advent of RepRap 3D printing for the fabrication of prototypes declining cost and broad adoption have opened up new realms of innovation As it has become cost effective to make just one item for prototyping or a small number of household items   this approach can be depicted as personal fabrication for \"a market of one person\"   Makerspaces edit Main articles Makerspace Hackerspace and Fablab The rise of the maker culture is closely associated with the rise of hackerspaces Fab Labs and other \"makerspaces\" of which there are now many around the world including over   each in Germany and the United States   Hackerspaces allow like-minded individuals to share ideas tools and skillsets     Some notable hackerspaces which have been linked with the maker culture include Artisan's Asylum   Dallas Makerspace   Noisebridge NYC Resistor Pumping Station One and TechShop In addition those who identify with the subculture can be found at more traditional universities with a technical orientation such as MIT and Carnegie Mellon specifically around \" shop \" areas like the MIT Hobby Shop and CMU Robotics Club As maker culture becomes more popular hackerspaces and Fab Labs are becoming more common in universities   and public libraries The federal government has started adopting the concept of fully open makerspaces within its agencies the first of which SpaceShop Rapid Prototyping Lab resides at NASA Ames Research Center   In Europe the popularity of the labs is more prominent than in the US about three times more labs exist there   Outside Europe and the US the maker culture is also on the rise with several hacker or makerspaces being landmarks in their respective cities' entrepreneurial and educational landscape More precisely HackerspaceSG in Singapore has been set up by the team now leading the city-state's and arguably South-East Asia's most prominent accelerator JFDI Asia Lamba Labs in Beirut is recognized as a hackerspace where people can collaborate freely in a city often divided by its different ethnic and religious groups   Xinchejian   in Shanghai is China's first hackerspace which allows for innovation and collaboration in a country known for its strong internet censorship With the rise of cities which will host 60% of mankind by     hackerspaces fablabs and makerspaces will likely gain traction as they are places for local entrepreneurs to gather and collaborate providing local solutions to environmental social or economical issues   The Institute for the Future has launched in this regard Maker Cities as \"an open and collaborative online game to generate ideas about how citizens are changing work production governance learning well-being and their neighborhoods and what this means for the future\"   The most comprehensive directory of Makerspaces around the world can be found here Maker segmentation edit As tools and technology became increasingly affordable and accessible and the business of making ecosystem more expansive and new makers started to learn basic skills such as soldering and working with Arduino and other easy-to-program development platforms makers began to segment into three distinct groups   Dougherty identified them as zero-to-maker maker-to-maker and maker-to-market A fourth segment was recently added maker-enabler or maker-advocate Zero to maker Every maker has a different starting point However the common thread begins with an inspiration to invent the spark that turns an individual from purely consuming products to having a hand in actually making them To go from zero to maker the two most important aspects are the ability to learn the requisite skills and access to the necessary means of production Maker to maker The distinction in this stage is that makers begin to collaborate and access the expertise of others At this stage makers also contribute to existing platforms Powerful undercurrents are at work both from technological revolution as well as unleashing the innate desire for self-expression and creation The desire to improve and share with others catalyzes the move to maker to maker Maker to market From the workshops and the digital communities a new wave of invention and innovation springs forth Knowledge flows and concentrates Some of the inventions and creations will appeal to a broader audience than the original makers Some may even find commercial appeal However even if only a few makers pursue market opportunities the impact may be huge Maker advocate For every maker in the above segments there are individuals that foster and support them Children's museums and public libraries are promoting more DIY activities and tools to expose patrons to maker culture in the zero-to-maker segment Family members and maker space staff support the maker-to-maker segment Many maker businesses have a cloud of supporting personnel that enable their success Although not necessarily makers themselves these maker-advocates comprise a large segment of maker culture Tools and hardware edit   Free hardware The Cloud edit The cloud describes a family of tools in service of the maker movement enabling increased collaboration digital workflow distributed manufacturing i e the download of files that translate directly into objects via a digitized manufacturing process and collaborative economy This combined with the Open source movement initially focused on software has been expanding into open-source hardware assisted by easy access to online plans in the cloud and licensing agreements Some example of cloud-based tools include online project repositories like Appropedia and thingiverse version-controlled collaborative platforms like GitHub and wevolver knowledge sharing platforms like instructables wikipedia and other Wikis including WikiHow and wikifab and platforms for distributed manufacturing like shapeways and 100k garages Microcomputers edit Programmable microcontrollers and microcomputers like the Arduino Raspberry Pi BeagleBone Black and Intel s Galileo and Edison controllers are easy to program and enable connected devices and some open source Combined with the cloud they re helping create the Internet of Things and lower the barrier to entry for hardware development Digital Fabrication edit Desktop 3D printing is now possible in various plastics and metals   In combination with DIY open-source microelectronics they can create autoreplicant 3d printers such as RepRap Digital fabrication also includes various subtractive fabrication tech eg Laser cutting CNC milling and Knitting machines To create one's own designs for digital fabrication requires digital design tools like solidworks autodesk and Rhinoceros 3D More recently less expensive or easier to use software has emerged For example fusion   is free for start ups and individuals and onshape and tinkercad are browser-based digital design software Online project repositories make many parts available for digital fabrication even for people who are unable to do their own design work Opendesk is one example of a company which has made a business by designing and hosting projects for distributed digital fabrication Funding Platforms edit Patreon and kickstarter are two examples of distributed funding platforms key to the Maker Movement Hand Tools edit Maker Culture is not all about new digital technologies Traditional and analog tools remain crucial to the movement Traditional tools are often more familiar and accessible which is key to Maker Culture In many places and projects where digital fabrication tools are just not suitable hand tools are Other types of making edit Maker culture involves many types of making - this section reviews some of the major types Amateur scientific equipment edit This involves making scientific instruments for citizen science or open source labs   With the advent of low-cost digital manufacturing it is becoming increasingly common for scientists as well as amateurs to fabricate their own scientific apparatuses from open source hardware designs     Docubricks is a repository of open source science hardware   Clothes edit   Ravelry Clothes can include sew and no-sew DIY hacks       Clothing can also include knitted or crocheted clothing and accessories Some knitters may use knitting machines with varying degrees of automatic patterning Fully electronic knitting machines can be interfaced to computers running computer-aided design software Arduino boards have been interfaced to electronic knitting machines to further automate the process   Free People a popular clothing retailer for young women often hosts craft nights inside the doors of its Anthropologie locations   Biology food and composting edit Examples of maker culture in food production include baking homebrewing winemaking vegoil pickling sausage cheesemaking yogurt and pastry production This can also extend into urban agriculture composting and synthetic biology   Organic cosmetics edit   Organic movement Maker cosmetics includes perfumes creams lotions gels and shampoos Tool kits for maker cosmetics can include beakers   and   ml digital scales laboratory thermometers if possible from -20 to   C pH paper glass rods plastic spatulas and spray to disinfect with alcohol Perfumes can be done at home using   ethanol also in the form of vodka or Everclear essential oils or fragrance oils infused oils even flavour extracts such as pure vanilla extract distilled or spring water and glycerine Tools include glass bottles glass jar measuring cup / measuring spoons a dropper funnel and aluminum foil or wrapping paper if you are using clear glass bottles   Musical instruments edit The concept of homemade and experimental instruments in music has its roots prior to the maker movement from complicated experiments with figures such as Reed Ghazala and Michel Waisvisz pioneering early circuit bending techniques to simple projects such as the Cigar Box Guitar Bart Hopkin published the magazine Experimental Musical Instruments for   years followed by a series of books about instrument building Organizations such as Zvex WORM STEIM Death by Audio and Casper Electronics cater to the do-it-yourself audience while musicians like Nicolas Collins and Yuri Landman create and perform with custom made and experimental instruments Tool making edit Makers can also make or fabricate their own tools   This includes knives hand tools lathes 3-D printers wood working tools   etc Vehicles edit A kit car also known as a \"component car\" is an automobile that is available as a set of parts that a manufacturer sells and the buyer himself then assembles into a functioning car Car tuning can include electric vehicle conversion Motorcycle making and conversions are also represented As examples Tinker Bike is an open source motorcycle kit adaptable to recycled components NightShift Bikes is a small Makerist project in custom DIY electric motorcycle conversions   Bicycles too have a DIY Maker-style community Zenga Bros ' Tall Bikes are one example   Community bike workshops are a specific type of makerspace   Media edit MAKE a magazine published since   by O'Reilly Media is considered a \"central organ of the Maker Movement \"   and its founder Dale Dougherty is widely considered the founder of the Movement Other media outlets associated with the movement include Wamungo Hackaday Makery and the popular weblog Boing Boing Boing Boing editor Cory Doctorow has written a novel Makers which he describes as being \"a book about people who hack hardware business-models and living arrangements to discover ways of staying alive and happy even when the economy is falling down the toilet\"   In   Intel sponsored a reality TV show America's Greatest Makers where   teams of Makers compete for $1 million Maker Faires edit Since   the subculture has held regular events around the world Maker Faire which in   drew a crowd of     attendees     Smaller community driven Maker Faires referred to as Mini Maker Fairs are also held in various places where an O'Reilly-organised Maker Faire has not yet been held         Maker Faire provides a Mini Maker Faire starter kit to encourage the spread of local Maker Faire events   Following the Maker Faire model similar events which don't use the Maker Faire brand have emerged around the world Maker Film Fest edit A Maker Film Festival was announced for August   Powerhouse Science Center in Durango Colorado featuring \"Films About Makers and Makers Making Movies \"   Criticisms edit The Maker Movement has at times been criticized for not fulfilling its goals of inclusivity and democratization   The most famous of these critiques come from Deb Chachra 's piece Why I Am Not a Maker in The Atlantic criticizing the movement's gendered history and present     Evgeny Morozov 's Making It in The New Yorker challenging the movement's potential to actually disrupt or democratize innovation     and Will Holman 's The Toaster Paradox about Thomas Thwaites ' the Toaster Project 's challenges to the DIY and \"Maker impulse \"   Others criticize that the Maker Movement is not a movement at all that it has grown to be so broad as to be practically meaningless   In   Garnet Hertz published a   issue book series titled Critical Making that collected submissions from   designers artists and academics to critically rethink the maker movement The project was an \"appeal to the electronic DIY maker movement to be critically engaged with culture history and society after learning to use a 3D printer making an LED blink or using an Arduino then

Achieving sustainability will enable the Earth to continue supporting human life Batad rice terraces The Philippines UNESCO World Heritage site Sustainability from 'sustain' and 'ability' is the

by persistently and dynamically approaching it the process results in a sustainable system   Healthy ecosystems and environments are necessary to the survival of humans and other organisms Ways of reducing negative human impact are environmentally-friendly chemical engineering environmental resources management and environmental protection Information is gained from green computing green

Etymology edit   Sustainable development The name sustainability is derived from the Latin sustinere tenere to hold sub under Sustain can mean \"maintain\" \"support\" or \"endure\"     Since the 1980s sustainability has been used more in the sense of human sustainability on planet Earth and this has resulted in the most widely quoted definition of sustainability as a part of the concept sustainable development that of the Brundtland Commission of the United Nations on March     \"sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\"     Components edit Three dimensions of sustainability edit A diagram indicating the relationship between the \"three pillars of sustainability\" in which both economy and society are constrained by environmental limits   Venn diagram of sustainable development at the confluence of three constituent parts   The   World Summit on Social Development identified sustainable development goals such as economic development social development and environmental protection   This view has been expressed as an illustration using three overlapping ellipses indicating that the three pillars of sustainability are not mutually exclusive and can be mutually reinforcing   In fact the three pillars are interdependent and in the long run none can exist without the others   The three pillars have served as a common ground for numerous sustainability standards and certification systems in recent years in particular in the food industry     Standards which today explicitly refer to the triple bottom line include Rainforest Alliance Fairtrade and UTZ Certified     Some sustainability experts and practitioners have illustrated four pillars of sustainability or a quadruple bottom line One such pillar is future generations which emphasizes the long-term thinking associated with sustainability   There is also an opinion that considers resource use and financial sustainability as two additional pillars of sustainability   Sustainable development consists of balancing local and global efforts to meet basic human needs without destroying or degrading the natural environment     The question then becomes how to represent the relationship between those needs and the environment A study from   pointed out that environmental justice is as important as sustainable development   Ecological economist Herman Daly asked \"what use is a sawmill without a forest?\"   From this perspective the economy is a subsystem of human society which is itself a subsystem of the biosphere and a gain in one sector is a loss from another   This perspective led to the nested circles figure of 'economics' inside 'society' inside the 'environment' The simple definition that sustainability is something that improves \"the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of supporting eco-systems\"   though vague conveys the idea of sustainability having quantifiable limits But sustainability is also a call to action a task in progress or \"journey\" and therefore a political process so some definitions set out common goals and values   The Earth Charter   speaks of \"a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature universal human rights economic justice and a culture of peace\" This suggested a more complex figure of sustainability which included the importance of the domain of 'politics' More than that sustainability implies responsible and proactive decision-making and innovation that minimizes negative impact and maintains balance between ecological resilience economic prosperity political justice and cultural vibrancy to ensure a desirable planet for all species now and in the future   Specific types of sustainability include sustainable agriculture sustainable architecture or ecological economics   Understanding sustainable development is important but without clear targets an unfocused term like \"liberty\" or \"justice\"   It has also been described as a \"dialogue of values that challenge the sociology of development\"   Circles of sustainability and the fourth dimension of sustainability edit Urban sustainability analysis of the greater urban area of the city of S o Paulo using the Circles of Sustainability' method of the UN and Metropolis Association   While the United Nations Millennium Declaration identified principles and treaties on sustainable development including economic development social development and environmental protection it continued using three domains economics environment and social sustainability More recently using a systematic domain model that responds to the debates over the last decade the Circles of Sustainability approach distinguished four domains of economic ecological political and cultural sustainability this in accord with the United Nations Unesco Agenda   and in particular the Agenda   for culture which specifies culture as the fourth domain of sustainable development   The model is now being used by organizations such as the United Nations Cities Programme   and Metropolis   In the case of Metropolis this approach does not mean adding a fourth domain of culture to the dominant triple bottom line figure of the economy environment and the social Rather it involves treating all four domains economy ecology politics and culture as social including economics and distinguishing between ecology as the intersection of the human and natural worlds and environment as that which goes far beyond what we as humans can ever know   Seven modalities edit Another model suggests humans attempt to achieve all of their needs and aspirations via seven modalities economy community occupational groups government environment culture and physiology   From the global to the individual human scale each of the seven modalities can be viewed across seven hierarchical levels Human sustainability can be achieved by attaining sustainability in all levels of the seven modalities Shaping the future edit Integral elements of sustainability are research and innovation activities A telling example is the European environmental research and innovation policy It aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to make them sustainable Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme Horizon   which is also open to participation worldwide   Encouraging good farming practices ensures farmers fully benefit from the environment and at the same time conserving it for future generations Additionally instigating innovative and sustainable travel and transportation solutions must play a vital role in this process   Resiliency edit Resiliency in ecology is the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbance and still retain its basic structure and viability Resilience-thinking evolved from the need to manage interactions between human-constructed systems and natural ecosystems in a sustainable way despite the fact that to policymakers a definition remains elusive Resilience-thinking addresses how much planetary ecological systems can withstand assault from human disturbances and still deliver the services current and future generations need from them It is also concerned with commitment from geopolitical policymakers to promote and manage essential planetary ecological resources in order to promote resilience and achieve sustainability of these essential resources for benefit of future generations of life?   The resiliency of an ecosystem and thereby its sustainability can be reasonably measured at junctures or events where the combination of naturally occurring regenerative forces solar energy water soil atmosphere vegetation and biomass interact with the energy released into the ecosystem from disturbances   A practical view of sustainability is closed systems that maintain processes of productivity indefinitely by replacing resources used by actions of people with resources of equal or greater value by those same people without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems   In this way sustainability can be concretely measured in human projects if there is a transparent accounting of the resources put back into the ecosystem to replace those displaced In nature the accounting occurs naturally through a process of adaptation as an ecosystem returns to viability from an external disturbance The adaptation is a multi-stage process that begins with the disturbance event earthquake volcanic eruption hurricane tornado flood or thunderstorm followed by absorption utilization or deflection of the energy or energies that the external forces created   In analysing systems such as urban and national parks dams farms and gardens theme parks open-pit mines water catchments one way to look at the relationship between sustainability and resiliency is to view the former with a long-term vision and resiliency as the capacity of human engineers to respond to immediate environmental events   History edit   History of sustainability The history of sustainability traces human-dominated ecological systems from the earliest civilizations to the present day   This history is characterized by the increased regional success of a particular society followed by crises that were either resolved producing sustainability or not leading to decline     In early human history the use of fire and desire for specific foods may have altered the natural composition of plant and animal communities   Between     and     years ago agrarian communities emerged which depended largely on their environment and the creation of a \"structure of permanence \"   The Western industrial revolution of the 18th to 19th centuries tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease   In the mid-20th century a gathering environmental movement pointed out that there were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed In the late 20th century environmental problems became global in scale         The   and   energy crises demonstrated the extent to which the global community had become dependent on non-renewable energy resources In the 21st century there is increasing global awareness of the threat posed by the human greenhouse effect produced largely by forest clearing and the burning of fossil fuels     Principles and concepts edit The philosophical and analytic framework of sustainability draws on and connects with many different disciplines and fields in recent years an area that has come to be called sustainability science has emerged   Scale and context edit Sustainability is studied and managed over many scales levels or frames of reference of time and space and in many contexts of environmental social and economic organization The focus ranges from the total carrying capacity sustainability of planet Earth to the sustainability of economic sectors ecosystems countries municipalities neighbourhoods home gardens individual lives individual goods and services clarification needed occupations lifestyles behaviour patterns and so on In short it can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it   As Daniel Botkin author and environmentalist has stated \"We see a landscape that is always in flux changing over many scales of time and space \"   The sheer size and complexity of the planetary ecosystem has proved problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability To shed light on the big picture explorer and sustainability campaigner Jason Lewis has drawn parallels to other more tangible closed systems For example he likens human existence on Earth isolated as the planet is in space whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources cannot be imported to prevent accelerated depletion of resources to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water   In both cases he argues exercising the precautionary principle is a key factor in survival   Consumption edit A major driver of human impact on Earth systems is the destruction of biophysical resources and especially the Earth's ecosystems The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used whether or not those resources are renewable and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved Careful resource management can be applied at many scales from economic sectors like agriculture manufacturing and industry to work organizations the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services     One of the initial attempts to express human impact mathematically was developed in the 1970s and is called the I PAT formula This formulation attempts to explain human consumption in terms of three components population numbers levels of consumption which it terms \"affluence\" although the usage is different and impact per unit of resource use which is termed \"technology\" because this impact depends on the technology used The equation is expressed I = P A T Where I = Environmental impact P = Population A = Affluence T = Technology   Circularity edit In recent years concepts based on re- cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance The most prominent among these concepts might be the Circular Economy with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union There is also a broad range of similar concepts or schools of thought including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology looped and performance economy regenerative design industrial ecology biomimicry and the blue economy These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution However these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs For example the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy and there are cases that require different or additional strategies like purchasing new more energy efficient equipment A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy namely a   conditional relation a   strong conditional relation a   necessary but not sufficient conditional relation a   beneficial relationship a structured and unstructured   subset relation a   degree relation a   cost-benefit/trade-off relation and a   selective relation   Measurement edit   Sustainability measurement Sustainability measurement is a term that denotes the measurements used as the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability   The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability involving the sustainability of environmental social and economic domains both individually and in various combinations are evolving they include indicators benchmarks audits sustainability standards and certification systems like Fairtrade and Organic indexes and accounting as well as assessment appraisal   and other reporting systems They are applied over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales     Some of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate sustainability reporting Triple Bottom Line accounting World Sustainability Society Circles of Sustainability and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the Environmental Sustainability Index and Environmental Performance Index Population edit   Human population planning Graph showing human population growth from     BC   AD illustrating current exponential growth World population growth rate     as estimated in   by the U S Census Bureau International Data Base According to the most recent July   revision of the official United Nations World Population Prospects the world population is projected to reach     billion by   up from the current     billion July   to exceed   billion people by   and to reach     billion by the year     Most of the increase will be in developing countries whose population is projected to rise from     billion in   to     billion in   This increase will be distributed among the population aged         billion and   or over     billion because the number of children under age   in developing countries is predicted to decrease In contrast the population of the more developed regions is expected to undergo only slight increase from     billion to     billion and this would have declined to     billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries which is expected to average     million persons annually from   to     Long-term estimates in   of global population suggest a peak at around   of nine to ten billion people and then a slow decrease to     billion by     Emerging economies like those of China and India aspire to the living standards of the Western world as does the non-industrialized world in general   It is the combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that poses a stark challenge to sustainability   Carrying capacity edit Further information Carrying capacity Ecological footprint for different nations compared to their Human Development Index HDI At the global scale scientific data now indicates that humans are living beyond the carrying capacity of planet Earth and that this cannot continue indefinitely This scientific evidence comes from many sources but is presented in detail in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and the planetary boundaries framework   An early detailed examination of global limits was published in the   book Limits to Growth which has prompted follow-up commentary and analysis   A   review in Nature by   international researchers expressed concerns that the Earth may be \"approaching a state shift\" in its biosphere   The Ecological footprint measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen In   it required     global hectares per person 30% more than the natural biological capacity of     global hectares assuming no provision for other organisms   The resulting ecological deficit must be met from unsustainable extra sources and these are obtained in three ways embedded in the goods and services of world trade taken from the past e g fossil fuels or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage e g by over exploiting forests and fisheries The figure right examines sustainability at the scale of individual countries by contrasting their Ecological Footprint with their UN Human Development Index a measure of standard of living The graph shows what is necessary for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while at the same time maintaining sustainable resource use The general trend is for higher standards of living to become less sustainable As always population growth has a marked influence on levels of consumption and the efficiency of resource use     The sustainability goal is to raise the global standard of living without increasing the use of resources beyond globally sustainable levels that is to not exceed \"one planet\" consumption Information generated by reports at the national regional and city scales confirm the global trend towards societies that are becoming less sustainable over time     Romanian American economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen a progenitor in economics and a paradigm founder of ecological economics has argued that the carrying capacity of Earth that is Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use     Leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly a student of Georgescu-Roegen has propounded the same argument       At the enterprise scale carrying capacity now also plays a critical role in making it possible to measure and report the sustainability performance of individual organizations This is most clearly demonstrated through use of Context-Based Sustainability CBS tools methods and metrics including the MultiCapital Scorecard which have been in development since       Contrary to many other mainstream approaches to measuring the sustainability performance of organizations which tend to be more incrementalist in form CBS is explicitly tied to social environmental and economic limits and thresholds in the world Thus rather than simply measure and report changes in relative terms from one period to another CBS makes it possible to compare the impacts of organizations to organization-specific norms standards or thresholds for what they the impacts would have to be in order to be empirically sustainable i e which if generalized to a larger population would not fail to maintain the sufficiency of vital resources for human or non-human well-being     Global human impact on biodiversity edit Further information Millennium Ecosystem Assessment At a fundamental level energy flow and biogeochemical cycling set an upper limit on the number and mass of organisms in any ecosystem   Human impacts on the Earth are demonstrated in a general way through detrimental changes in the global biogeochemical cycles of chemicals that are critical to life most notably those of water oxygen carbon nitrogen and phosphorus   The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is an international synthesis by over   of the world's leading biological scientists that analyzes the state of the Earth's ecosystems and provides summaries and guidelines for decision-makers It concludes that human activity is having a significant and escalating impact on the biodiversity of world ecosystems reducing both their resilience and biocapacity The report refers to natural systems as humanity's \"life-support system\" providing essential \" ecosystem services \" The assessment measures   ecosystem services concluding that only four have shown improvement over the last   years   are in serious decline and five are in a precarious condition   Sustainable development goals edit   Sustainable development goals The Sustainable Development Goals SDGs are the current harmonized set of seventeen future international development targets The Official Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted on   September   has   paragraphs with the main paragraph   outlining the   Sustainable Development Goals and its associated   targets This included the following seventeen goals   Poverty End poverty in all its forms everywhere   Food End hunger achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture   Health Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages   Education Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all   Women Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls   Water Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all   Energy Ensure access to affordable reliable sustainable and modern energy for all   Economy Promote sustained inclusive and sustainable economic growth full and productive employment and decent work for all   Infrastructure Build resilient infrastructure promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation   Inequality Reduce inequality within and among countries   Habitation Make cities and human settlements inclusive safe resilient and sustainable   Consumption Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns   Climate Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts ensuring that both mitigation and adaptation strategies are in placed   Marine-ecosystems Conserve and sustainably use the oceans seas and marine resources for sustainable development   Ecosystems Protect restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems sustainably manage forests combat desertification and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss   Institutions Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development provide access to justice for all and build effective accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels   Sustainability Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development   As of August   there were   proposed targets for these goals and   proposed indicators to show compliance   The Sustainable Development Goals SDGs replace the eight Millennium Development Goals MDGs which expired at the end of   The MDGs were established in   following the Millennium Summit of the United Nations Adopted by the   United Nations member states at the time and more than twenty international organizations these goals were advanced to help achieve the following sustainable development standards by   To eradicate extreme poverty and hunger To achieve universal primary education To promote gender equality and empower women To reduce child mortality To improve maternal health To combat HIV/AIDS malaria and other diseases To ensure environmental sustainability one of the targets in this goal focuses on increasing sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation To develop a global partnership for development Sustainable development edit According to the data that member countries represented to the United Nations Cuba was the only country in the world in   that met the World Wide Fund for Nature 's definition of sustainable development with an ecological footprint of less than     hectares per capita     and a Human Development Index of over             Environmental dimension edit Healthy ecosystems provide vital goods and services to humans and other organisms There are two major ways of reducing negative human impact and enhancing ecosystem services and the first of these is environmental management This direct approach is based largely on information gained from earth science environmental science and conservation biology However this is management at the end of a long series of indirect causal factors that are initiated by human consumption so a second approach is through demand management of human resource use Management of human consumption of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from economics Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment   Environmental management edit   Sustainability and environmental management At the global scale and in the broadest sense environmental management involves the oceans freshwater systems land and atmosphere but following the sustainability principle of scale it can be equally applied to any ecosystem from a tropical rainforest to a home garden     Atmosphere edit At a March   meeting of the Copenhagen Climate Council     climate experts from   countries issued a keynote statement that there is now \"no excuse\" for failing to act on global warming and that without strong carbon reduction \"abrupt or irreversible\" shifts in climate may occur that \"will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with\"     Management of the global atmosphere now involves assessment of all aspects of the carbon cycle to identify opportunities to address human-induced climate change and this has become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential catastrophic effects on biodiversity and human communities see Energy below Other human impacts on the atmosphere include the air pollution in cities the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides sulfur oxides volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance albedo of the Earth 's surface Known as global dimming the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between   and   although the trend has subsequently reversed Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming   Freshwater and oceans edit Changes in environmental conditions lead to coral bleaching and harm to biodiversity of fragile marine ecosystems Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface Of this   5% is the salty water of the oceans and only   5% freshwater most of which is locked up in the Antarctic ice sheet The remaining freshwater is found in glaciers lakes rivers wetlands the soil aquifers and atmosphere Due to the water cycle fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation however there is still a limited amount necessitating management of this resource Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for ecosystem services has only recently emerged as during the 20th century more than half the world's wetlands have been lost along with their valuable environmental services Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean safe water   Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue harvestable and green soil water available for plant use water and this applies at all scales of water management   Ocean circulation patterns have a strong influence on climate and weather and in turn the food supply of both humans and other organisms Scientists have warned of the possibility under the influence of climate change of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of ocean currents that could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe   Ten per cent of the world's population about   million people live in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise Land use edit A rice paddy in Bangladesh Rice wheat corn and potatoes make up more than half the world's food supply Loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to man-made capital Land use change is fundamental to the operations of the biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation agriculture forest woodland grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems   At the local human scale major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities     Since the Neolithic Revolution about 47% of the world's forests have been lost to human use Present-day forests occupy about a quarter of the world's ice-free land with about half of these occurring in the tropics   In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing with the exception of Siberia but deforestation in the tropics is of major concern   Food is essential to life Feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth's resources This begins with the appropriation of about 38% of the Earth's land surface   and about 20% of its net primary productivity   Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness everything from the crop need for irrigation water synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of food packaging transport now a major part of global trade and retail Environmental problems associated with industrial agriculture and agribusiness are now being addressed through such movements as sustainable agriculture organic farming and more sustainable business practices   Management of human consumption edit Further information Consumption economics Helix of sustainability the carbon cycle of manufacturing The underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption   This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production use and disposal more sustainable Consumption of goods and services can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns through to the resource demands of specific goods and services the impacts of economic sectors through national economies to the global economy   Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation The ideas of embodied resource use the total resources needed to produce a product or service resource intensity and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption Key resource categories relating to human needs are food energy materials and water In   the International Resource Panel hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP published the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production   and identified priority actions for developed and developing countries The study found that the most critical impacts are related to ecosystem health human health and resource depletion From a production perspective it found that fossil-fuel combustion processes agriculture and fisheries have the most important impacts Meanwhile from a final consumption perspective it found that household consumption related to mobility shelter food and energy-using products cause the majority of life-cycle impacts of consumption Energy edit Main articles Sustainable energy Renewable energy and Efficient energy use Flow of CO   in an ecosystem The Sun's energy stored by plants primary producers during photosynthesis passes through the food chain to other organisms to ultimately power all living processes Since the industrial revolution the concentrated energy of the Sun stored in fossilized plants as fossil fuels has been a major driver of technology which in turn has been the source of both economic and political power In   climate scientists of the IPCC concluded that there was at least a 90% probability that atmospheric increase in CO   was human-induced mostly as a result of fossil fuel emissions but to a lesser extent from changes in land use Stabilizing the world's climate will require high-income countries to reduce their emissions by   90% over   levels by   which should hold CO   levels at     ppm from current levels of about   ppm Above this level temperatures could rise by more than   C to produce \"catastrophic\" climate change     Reduction of current CO   levels must be achieved against a background of global population increase and developing countries aspiring to energy-intensive high consumption Western lifestyles   Reducing greenhouse emissions is being tackled at all scales ranging from tracking the passage of carbon through the carbon cycle   to the commercialization of renewable energy developing less carbon-hungry technology and transport systems and attempts by individuals to lead carbon neutral lifestyles by monitoring the fossil fuel use embodied in all the goods and services they use   Engineering of emerging technologies such as carbon-neutral fuel       and energy storage systems such as power to gas compressed air energy storage     and pumped-storage hydroelectricity       are necessary to store power from transient renewable energy sources including emerging renewables such as airborne wind turbines   Water edit Further information Water resources Water security and food security are inextricably linked In the decade     human water withdrawals were four times greater than the previous decade This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy especially the increase in irrigated land growth in industrial and power sectors and intensive dam construction on all continents This altered the water cycle of rivers and lakes affected their water quality and had a significant impact on the global water cycle   Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe populations increase aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary   From   to   water demand doubled agricultural use increased by 75% industrial use by more than 200% and domestic use more than 400%   In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using   50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture 22% for industry and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing   Water efficiency is being improved on a global scale by increased demand management improved infrastructure improved water productivity of agriculture minimising the water intensity embodied water of goods and services addressing shortages in the non-industrialized world concentrating food production in areas of high productivity and planning for climate change such as through flexible system design A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible     At the local level people are becoming more self-sufficient by harvesting rainwater and reducing use of mains water     Food edit Feijoada A typical black bean food dish from Brazil Further information Food Food security and Category Sustainable food system The American Public Health Association APHA defines a \"sustainable food system\"     as \"one that provides healthy food to meet current food needs while maintaining healthy ecosystems that can also provide food for generations to come with minimal negative impact to the environment A sustainable food system also encourages local production and distribution infrastructures and makes nutritious food available accessible and affordable to all Further it is humane and just protecting farmers and other workers consumers and communities \"   Concerns about the environmental impacts of agribusiness and the stark contrast between the obesity problems of the Western world and the poverty and food insecurity of the developing world have generated a strong movement towards healthy sustainable eating as a major component of overall ethical consumerism   The environmental effects of different dietary patterns depend on many factors including the proportion of animal and plant foods consumed and the method of food production         The World Health Organization has published a Global Strategy on Diet Physical Activity and Health report which was endorsed by the May   World Health Assembly It recommends the Mediterranean diet which is associated with health and longevity and is low in meat rich in fruits and vegetables low in added sugar and limited salt and low in saturated fatty acids the traditional source of fat in the Mediterranean is olive oil rich in monounsaturated fat The healthy rice-based Japanese diet is also high in carbohydrates and low in fat Both diets are low in meat and saturated fats and high in legumes and other vegetables they are associated with a low incidence of ailments and low environmental impact   At the global level the environmental impact of agribusiness is being addressed through sustainable agriculture and organic farming At the local level there are various movements working towards local food production more productive use of urban wastelands and domestic gardens including permaculture urban horticulture local food slow food sustainable gardening and organic gardening     Sustainable seafood is seafood from either fished or farmed sources that can maintain or increase production in the future without jeopardizing the ecosystems from which it was acquired The sustainable seafood movement has gained momentum as more people become aware about both overfishing and environmentally destructive fishing methods Materials toxic substances waste edit An electric wire reel reused as a center table in a Rio de Janeiro decoration fair The reuse of materials is a sustainable practice that is rapidly growing among designers in Brazil As global population and affluence has increased so has the use of various materials increased in volume diversity and distance transported Included here are raw materials minerals synthetic chemicals including hazardous substances manufactured products food living organisms and waste   By   humanity could consume an estimated   billion tons of minerals ores fossil fuels and biomass per year three times its current amount unless the economic growth rate is decoupled from the rate of natural resource consumption Developed countries' citizens consume an average of   tons of those four key resources per capita ranging up to   or more tons per person in some developed countries with resource consumption levels far beyond what is likely sustainable   Sustainable use of materials has targeted the idea of dematerialization converting the linear path of materials extraction use disposal in landfill to a circular material flow that reuses materials as much as possible much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature   This approach is supported by product stewardship and the increasing use of material flow analysis at all levels especially individual countries and the global economy   The use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources and that can be recycled is preferred to the use on non-renewables from a life cycle standpoint The waste hierarchy Synthetic chemical production has escalated following the stimulus it received during the second World War Chemical production includes everything from herbicides pesticides and fertilizers to domestic chemicals and hazardous substances   Apart from the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere chemicals of particular concern include heavy metals nuclear waste chlorofluorocarbons persistent organic pollutants and all harmful chemicals capable of bioaccumulation Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless there needs to be rigorous testing of new chemicals in all countries for adverse environmental and health effects International legislation has been established to deal with the global distribution and management of dangerous goods     The effects of some chemical agents needed long-term measurements and a lot of legal battles to realize their danger to human health The classification of the toxic carcinogenic agents is handle by the International Agency for Research on Cancer Every economic activity produces material that can be classified as waste To reduce waste industry business and government are now mimicking nature by turning the waste produced by industrial metabolism into resource Dematerialization is being encouraged through the ideas of industrial ecology ecodesign   and ecolabelling In addition to the well-established \"reduce reuse and recycle\" shoppers are using their purchasing power for ethical consumerism   The European Union is expected to table by the end of   an ambitious Circular Economy package which is expected to include concrete legislative proposals on waste management ecodesign and limits on land fills Economic dimension edit Further information Ecological economics Environmental economics and Green economy The Great Fish Market painted by Jan Brueghel the Elder On one account sustainability \"concerns the specification of a set of actions to be taken by present persons that will not diminish the prospects of future persons to enjoy levels of consumption wealth utility or welfare comparable to those enjoyed by present persons\"   Sustainability interfaces with economics through the social and ecological consequences of economic activity   Sustainability economics represents \" a broad interpretation of ecological economics where environmental and ecological variables and issues are basic but part of a multidimensional perspective Social cultural health-related and monetary/financial aspects have to be integrated into the analysis \"   However the concept of sustainability is much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare resources or profit margins   At present the average per capita consumption of people in the developing world is sustainable but population numbers are increasing and individuals are aspiring to high-consumption Western lifestyles The developed world population is only increasing slightly but consumption levels are unsustainable The challenge for sustainability is to curb and manage Western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact This must be done by using strategies and technology that break the link between on the one hand economic growth and on the other environmental damage and resource depletion   A recent UNEP report proposes a green economy defined as one that \"improves human well-being and social equity while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities\" it \"does not favor one political perspective over another but works to minimize excessive depletion of natural capital \" The report makes three key findings \"that greening not only generates increases in wealth in particular a gain in ecological commons or natural capital but also over a period of six years produces a higher rate of GDP growth\" that there is \"an inextricable link between poverty eradication and better maintenance and conservation of the ecological commons arising from the benefit flows from natural capital that are received directly by the poor\" \"in the transition to a green economy new jobs are created which in time exceed the losses in \"brown economy\" jobs However there is a period of job losses in transition which requires investment in re-skilling and re-educating the workforce\"   Several key areas have been targeted for economic analysis and reform the environmental effects of unconstrained economic growth the consequences of nature being treated as an economic externality and the possibility of an economics that takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior   Decoupling

and environmental degradation as communities grow so the environment declines This trend is clearly demonstrated on graphs of human population numbers economic growth and environmental indicators   Unsustainable economic growth has been starkly compared to the malignant growth of a cancer   because it eats away at the Earth's ecosystem services which are its life-support system There is concern that unless resource use is checked modern global civilization will follow the path of ancient civilizations that collapsed through overexploitation of their resource base     While conventional economics is concerned largely with economic growth and the efficient allocation of resources ecological economics has the explicit goal of sustainable scale rather than continual growth fair distribution and efficient allocation in that order     The World Business Council for Sustainable Development states that \"business cannot succeed in societies that fail\"   In economic and environmental fields the term decoupling is becoming increasingly used in the context of economic production and environmental quality When used in this way it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to environmental quality     An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled Exactly how if or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate In   the International Resource Panel hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP warned that by   the human race could be devouring   billion tons of minerals ores fossil fuels and biomass per year three times its current rate of consumption unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling   The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of   tons of those four key resources per capita per annum ranging up to   or more tons per person in some developed countries By comparison the average person in India today consumes four tons per year Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce resource intensity the amount of resource e g water energy or materials needed for the production consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service whether this be achieved from improved economic management product design or new technology   There are conflicting views whether improvements in technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation On the one hand it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity i e energy and materials use per unit GDP could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution     On the other hand an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth in large part because of the rebound effect conservation or Jevons Paradox resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution     Furthermore there are inherent thermodynamic i e second law of thermodynamics and practical limits to all efficiency improvements For example there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food and there are limits to making automobiles houses furniture and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions   Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution i e economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run Consequently long-term sustainability requires the transition to a steady state economy in which total GDP remains more or less constant as has been advocated for decades by Herman Daly and others in the ecological economics community A different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the restore approach   This approach views \"restore\" as a fourth component to the common reduce reuse recycle motto Participants in such efforts are encouraged to voluntarily donate towards nature conservation a small fraction of the financial savings they experience through a more frugal use of resources These financial savings would normally lead to rebound effects but a theoretical analysis suggests that donating even a small fraction of the experienced savings can potentially more than eliminate rebound effects   Nature as an economic externality edit Deforestation of native rain forest in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of clay for civil engineering   picture Further information Ecosystem services The economic importance of nature is indicated by the use of the expression ecosystem services to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free   In general as a commodity or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality technical innovation and alternative products However this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system   As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded a situation sometimes referred to as the Tragedy of the Commons   One approach to this dilemma has been the attempt to \"internalize\" these \"externalities\" by using market strategies like ecotaxes and incentives tradeable permits for carbon and the encouragement of payment for ecosystem services Community currencies associated with Local Exchange Trading Systems LETS a gift economy and Time Banking have also been promoted as a way of supporting local economies and the environment     Green economics is another market-based attempt to address issues of equity and the environment   The global recession and a range of associated government policies are likely to bring the biggest annual fall in the world's carbon dioxide emissions in   years   Economic opportunity edit Treating the environment as an externality may generate short-term profit at the expense of sustainability   Sustainable business practices on the other hand integrate ecological concerns with social and economic ones i e the triple bottom line     Growth that depletes ecosystem services is sometimes termed \" uneconomic growth \" as it leads to a decline in quality of life     Minimizing such growth can provide opportunities for local businesses For example industrial waste can be treated as an \"economic resource in the wrong place\" The benefits of waste reduction include savings from disposal costs fewer environmental penalties and reduced liability insurance This may lead to increased market share due to an improved public image     Energy efficiency can also increase profits by reducing costs The idea of sustainability as a business opportunity has led to the formation of organizations such as the Sustainability Consortium of the Society for Organizational Learning the Sustainable Business Institute and the World Council for Sustainable Development   The expansion of sustainable business opportunities can contribute to job creation through the introduction of green-collar workers   Research focusing on progressive corporate leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has yielded a leadership competency model for sustainability     and led to emergence of the concept of \"embedded sustainability\" defined by its authors Chris Laszlo and Nadya Zhexembayeva as \"incorporation of environmental health and social value into the core business with no trade-off in price or quality in other words with no social or green premium\"   Laszlo and Zhexembayeva's research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value creation a better risk-management b increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use c better product differentiation d new market entrances e enhanced brand and reputation f greater opportunity to influence industry standards and g greater opportunity for radical innovation   Nadya Zhexembayeva 's   research further suggested that innovation driven by resource depletion can result in fundamental advantages for company products and services as well as the company strategy as a whole when right principles of innovation are applied   Ecosocialist approach edit Further information Eco-socialism and Marxism One school of thought often labeled ecosocialism or ecological Marxism asserts that the capitalist economic system is fundamentally incompatible with the ecological and social requirements of sustainability   This theory rests on the premises that Capitalism's sole economic purpose is \"unlimited capital accumulation \" in the hands of the capitalist class   The urge to accumulate the profit motive drives capitalists to continually reinvest and expand production creating indefinite and unsustainable economic growth     \"Capital tends to degrade the conditions of its own production\" the ecosystems and resources on which any economy depends   Thus according to this analysis Giving economic priority to the fulfillment of human needs while staying within ecological limits as sustainable development demands is in conflict with the structural workings of capitalism   A steady-state capitalist economy is impossible   further a steady-state capitalist economy is socially undesirable due to the inevitable outcome of massive unemployment and underemployment   Capitalism will unless overcome by revolution run up against the physical limits of the biosphere and self-destruct   By this logic market-based solutions to ecological crises ecological economics environmental economics green economy are rejected as technical tweaks that do not confront capitalism's structural failures     \"Low-risk\" technology/science-based solutions such as solar power sustainable agriculture and increases in energy efficiency are seen as necessary but insufficient   \"High-risk\" technological solutions such as nuclear power and climate engineering are entirely rejected   Attempts made by businesses to \" greenwash \" their practices are regarded as false advertising and it is pointed out that implementation of renewable technology such as Walmart 's proposition to supply their electricity with solar power has the effect opposite of reductions in resource consumption viz further economic growth   Sustainable business models and the triple bottom line are viewed as morally praiseworthy but ignorant to the tendency in capitalism for the distribution of wealth to become increasingly unequal and socially unstable/unsustainable     Ecosocialists claim that the general unwillingness of capitalists to tolerate and capitalist governments to implement constraints on maximum profit such as ecotaxes or preservation and conservation measures renders environmental reforms incapable of facilitating large-scale change \"History teaches us that although capitalism has at times responded to environmental movements at a certain point at which the system's underlying accumulation drive is affected its resistance to environmental demands stiffens \"   They also note that up until the event of total ecological collapse destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation thus capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters i e convert to sustainable/ecological production   Ecosocialists advocate for the revolutionary succession of capitalism by ecosocialism an egalitarian economic/political/social structure designed to harmonize human society with non-human ecology and to fulfill human needs as the only sufficient solution to the present-day ecological crisis and hence the only path towards sustainability   Sustainability is viewed not as a domain exclusive to scientists environmental activists and business leaders but as a holistic project that must involve the whole of humanity redefining its place in Nature \"What every environmentalist needs to know is that capitalism is not the solution but the problem and that if humanity is going to survive this crisis it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom through social struggle in order to create a whole new world in coevolution with the planet \"   Social dimension edit Further information Social sustainability   Environmental policy Sustainability issues are generally expressed in scientific and environmental terms as well as in ethical terms of stewardship but implementing change is a social challenge that entails among other things international and national law urban planning and transport local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism   \"The relationship between human rights and human development corporate power and environmental justice global poverty and citizen action suggest that responsible global citizenship is an inescapable element of what may at first glance seem to be simply matters of personal consumer and moral choice \"   Peace security social justice edit Further information Peace Social justice Environmental justice and Environmental ethics Social disruptions like war crime and corruption divert resources from areas of greatest human need damage the capacity of societies to plan for the future and generally threaten human well-being and the environment   Broad-based strategies for more sustainable social systems include improved education and the political empowerment of women especially in developing countries greater regard for social justice notably equity between rich and poor both within and between countries and intergenerational equity   Depletion of natural resources including fresh water   increases the likelihood of \"resource wars\"   This aspect of sustainability has been referred to as environmental security and creates a clear need for global environmental agreements to manage resources such as aquifers and rivers which span political boundaries and to protect shared global systems including oceans and the atmosphere   Poverty edit Further information Poverty A major hurdle to achieve sustainability is the alleviation of poverty It has been widely acknowledged that poverty is one source of environmental degradation Such acknowledgment has been made by the Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future   and the Millennium Development Goals   There is a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions that it is impossible to separate economic development issues from environment issues according to the Brundtland report \"poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality \"   Individuals living in poverty tend to rely heavily on their local ecosystem as a source for basic needs such as nutrition and medicine and general well-being   As population growth continues to increase increasing pressure is being placed on the local ecosystem to provide these basic essentials According to the UN Population Fund high fertility and poverty have been strongly correlated and the world's poorest countries also have the highest fertility and population growth rates   The word sustainability is also used widely by western country development agencies and international charities to focus their poverty alleviation efforts in ways that can be sustained by the local populace and its environment For example teaching water treatment to the poor by boiling their water with charcoal would not generally be considered a sustainable strategy whereas using PET solar water disinfection would be Also sustainable best practices can involve the recycling of materials such as the use of recycled plastics for lumber where deforestation has devastated a country's timber base Another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries such as Bridges to Prosperity 's use of wire rope from shipping container gantry cranes to act as the structural wire rope for footbridges that cross rivers in poor rural areas in Asia and Africa Human relationship to nature edit According to Murray Bookchin the idea that humans must dominate nature is common in hierarchical societies Bookchin contends that capitalism and market relationships if unchecked have the capacity to reduce the planet to a mere resource to be exploited Nature is thus treated as a commodity \"The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital \"   Social ecology founded by Bookchin is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity's present ecological problems originate in indeed are mere symptoms of dysfunctional social arrangements Whereas most authors proceed as if our ecological problemy implementing recommendations which stem from physical biological economic etc studies Bookchin's claim is that these problems can only be resolved by understanding the underlying social processes and intervening in those processes by applying the concepts and methods of the social sciences   A pure capitalist approach has also been criticized in Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change to mitigation the effects of global warming in this excerpt the greatest example of market failure we have ever seen     In regards of the United States of America The Government and the Economy has had a long lasting impact on the environment but in a problematic way Policy issues regarding the environment has shown that the country regards the protection of the environment as a \"second hand issue \" One causation from this is a certain dilemma called \"collective action problem\" or collective action dilemmas \" These occur when individuals firms or governments would be better off if they cooperated in the pursuit of a common goal but for one reason or another one or more of those involved choose a less optimal course of action   Matthew Potoski and Aseem Prakash have made a model establishing   cells that are explaining each benefit for the government or the economic process For the government one cost might be the loss of public confidence and trust while a firm might lose market share and profitability   Deep ecology is a movement founded by Arne Naess that establishes principles for the well-being of all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms The movement advocates among other things a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world To achieve this deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic technological and ideological structures that will improve the quality of life rather than the standard of living Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen   The concept of a billion-year Sustainocene has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species for example through artificial photosynthesis allowing Rights of Nature   Human settlements edit Sustainability principles   Reduce dependence upon fossil fuels underground metals and minerals   Reduce dependence upon synthetic chemicals and other unnatural substances   Reduce encroachment upon nature   Meet human needs fairly & efficiently   One approach to sustainable living exemplified by small-scale urban transition towns and rural ecovillages seeks to create self-reliant communities based on principles of simple living which maximize self-sufficiency particularly in food production These principles on a broader scale underpin the concept of a bioregional economy   These approaches often utilize commons based knowledge sharing of open source appropriate technology   Other approaches loosely based around New Urbanism are successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve sustainable cities which support sustainable transport and zero emission housing Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures compared with those living in sprawling suburbs   Compact urban neighbourhoods would also promote a great people climate where by increasing the accessibility to bike walk or take public transport within neighbourhoods would increase the amount of interaction between people With more diversification between people this increases people's happiness and leads to a better standard of living   In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth architectural tradition and classical design     This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl   Both trends started in the 1980s The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl Large scale social movements can influence both community choices and the built environment Eco-municipalities may be one such movement   Eco-municipalities take a systems approach based on sustainability principles The eco-municipality movement is participatory involving community members in a bottom-up approach In Sweden more than   cities and towns   per cent of all municipalities in the country have adopted a common set of \"Sustainability Principles\" and implemented these systematically throughout their municipal operations There are now twelve eco-municipalities in the United States and the American Planning Association has adopted sustainability objectives based on the same principles   There is a wealth of advice available to individuals wishing to reduce their personal and social impact on the environment through small inexpensive and easily achievable steps     But the transition required to reduce global human consumption to within sustainable limits involves much larger changes at all levels and contexts of society   The United Nations has recognised the central role of education and have declared a decade of education for sustainable development     which aims to \"challenge us all to adopt new behaviours and practices to secure our future\"   The Worldwide Fund for Nature proposes a strategy for sustainability that goes beyond education to tackle underlying individualistic and materialistic societal values head-on and strengthen people's connections with the natural world   Human and labor rights edit Application of social sustainability requires stakeholders to look at human and labor rights prevention of human trafficking and other human rights risks   These issues should be considered in production and procurement of various worldwide commodities The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services   The Equator Principles financial industry Fair Wear Foundation garments and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level such as Green Seal for cleaning products NSF -140 for carpet production and even labeling of Organic food in the United States   Cultural dimension edit Further information Cultural sustainability   Agenda   for culture and United Cities and Local Governments The cultural dimension of sustainability is known as cultural sustainability Important in the advancement of this notion have been the United Nations Unesco and in particular their Agenda   and Agenda   for culture now also known as Culture   a program for cultural governance developed in     and coordinated by United Cities and Local Governments UCLG created in   Tourism edit Sustainability is central to underpinning feelings of authenticity in tourism   Experiences can be enhanced when substituting the contrived for the genuine and at the same time inspire a potentially deleterious appetite for follow-up visits to the real thing objectively authentic sites untouched by repair or rejuvenation Feelings of authenticity at a tourist site are thus implicitly linked to sustainable tourism as the maximisation of existential \"felt\"

hackerspace RaumZeitLabor A hackerspace also referred to as a hacklab hackspace or makerspace is a community-operated often not for profit   c   in the United States work space where people with

University Maker/Hackerspaces     Makerspaces     Tool Library     Repair Cafe     Music Hackerspaces     Bicycle Coops       References     Activities edit Many hackerspaces support the free software movement In general hackerspaces function as centers for peer learning and knowledge sharing in the form of workshops presentations and lectures They usually also offer social activities for their members such as game nights and parties Hackerspaces can be viewed as open community labs incorporating elements of machine shops workshops and/or studios where hackers can come together to share resources and knowledge to build and make things   Many hackerspaces participate in the use and development of free software open hardware and alternative media They are often physically located in infoshops social centers adult education centers public schools public libraries or on university campuses but may relocate to industrial or warehouse when they need more room The community-building learning and innovation potential of hackerspaces has been explored   Hackerspaces can be seen as vehicles for citizen-driven transformation and thus play a key part in a more inclusive participatory and commons-oriented city Hackerspaces with open membership became common throughout Germany in the 1990s in the orbit of the German Chaos Computer Club CCC with the c-base being probably an example The concept however was limited to less than a dozen s within Germany and did not spread beyond borders at first Most likely this was because initial founding costs were prohibitive for small groups without the support of a large organization like the CCC In   Paul Bohm came up with a fundraising strategy based on the Street Performer Protocol to build Metalab in Vienna Austria and became its founding director In   he and others started Hackerspaces org a wiki-based website that maintains a list of many hackerspaces and documents patterns on how to start and run them As of September   the community list included   hackerspaces with   active sites and   planned sites   The advent of crowdfunding and Kickstarter has put the tools required to build hackerspaces within reach of an even wider audience Those tools are for example used by Bilal Ghalib who had previously worked on a hackerspace documentary and others to bring the hackerspace concept to the Middle East   Naomi Wu demonstrating how to configure a Raspberry Pi   Most recent studies of hackerspace in China where Internet access is heavily censored suggest that new businesses and organized tech conferences there serve to intervene in the status quo \"from within\" The first hackerspace in China Xinchejian   opened in Shanghai in   Thereafter a network of hackerspaces emerged nourishing an emerging maker culture By designing open technologies and developing new businesses Chinese makers make use of the system make fun of it altering it and provoking it DIY makers often bring and align contradictory ideas together such as copycat and open source manufacturing and DIY individual empowerment and collective change In doing so they craft a subject position beyond the common rhetoric that Chinese citizens lack creativity As a site of individual empowerment hackerspace and DIY making enable people to remake the very societal norms and material infrastructures that undergird their work and livelihood   Facilities edit An artist gives a tour of one of the two machine shops in Xanadu a makerspace under the aegis of Burning Man Idaho Burners Alliance in Boise which is open to all Makerspace layout The specific tools and resources available at hackerspaces vary from place to place They typically provide for members to work on their individual projects or to collaborate on group projects with other members Hackerspaces may also operate computer tool lending libraries   or physical tool lending libraries up to and including creative sex toys in some instances   The building or facility the hackerspace occupies provides physical infrastructure that members need to complete their projects In addition to most hackerspaces provide electrical power computer servers and networking with Internet connectivity Well-equipped hackerspaces may provide machine tools sewing crafting art fabrication audio equipment video projectors game consoles electronic instrumentation such as oscilloscopes and signal generators electronic components and raw materials for hacking and various other tools for electronics fabrication and creating things   Specialized large-format printers 3D printers laser cutters industrial sewing machines or water jet cutters may be available for members to use Some hackerspaces provide food storage and food preparation equipment and may teach courses in basic or advanced cooking Organization edit Billboard promoting makerspaces The individual character of a hackerspace is determined by its members Many hackerspaces are governed by elected boards selected by active members in good standing Elected officers may serve predetermined terms and help direct decisionmaking with regards to purchasing new equipment recruiting new members formulating policy conforming to safety requirements and other administrative issues Membership fees are usually the main income of a hackerspace but some also accept external sponsors Some hackerspaces in the US have   c   status or the equivalent in their jurisdiction while others have chosen to forgo tax exempt status   University-affiliated hackerspaces often do not charge an explicit fee but are generally limited to students staff or alumni although visiting guests from other hackerspaces are usually welcome Some hackerspaces accept volunteer labor in lieu of membership fees especially from financially limited participants In addition some hackerspaces earn income from sponsoring and staffing high-tech flea markets where members of the general public may buy and sell new and used equipment and supplies There is a loose informal tradition at many hackerspaces of welcoming visitors from other similar organizations whether across town or internationally Free exchange of ideas skills and knowledge are encouraged especially at periodic gatherings sometimes called \"build nights\" or \"open house\" days Hackerspaces and makerspaces are increasingly being included as learning s in schools learning commons and other educational facilities   Ethic edit Hackerspaces are widely defined on hackerspaces org as community-operated physical places where people can meet and work on their projects The exact functioning of the varies from place to place and is determined by its members and while there is no blueprint or set of guidelines to create a hackerspace they generally follow a hacker ethic   which include freedom in the sense of autonomy as well as of free access and circulation of information distrust of authority that is opposing the traditional industrial top-down style of organization embracing the concept of learning by doing and peer-to-peer learning processes as opposed to formal modes of learning sharing solidarity and cooperation   Difficulties edit Hackerspaces can run into difficulties with building codes or other planning regulations which may not be designed to handle their scope of activities For example a new hackerspace in Nashua New Hampshire was shut down by the city after an inspection in   The main issues involved ventilation of heat and toxic fumes the space was reopened after improvements were made to the building   The difficulties with opening hackerspaces and makerspaces within non-profit organizations such as schools and public libraries include cost liability and availability of personnel   Many hackerspaces struggle to attract diverse users One national study showed makerspace users were 81% male   Although many women participate in some form of making 41% have backgrounds that are in the realms of arts crafts and design which are not taken as seriously in maker culture citation needed Because makerspaces are most often dominated by male makers 65% of whom have physical science or engineering backgrounds women with more creative backgrounds tend to feel unwelcome Makers with less technical backgrounds employ a different style of working taking time to sketch and think To more technically proficient makers this is seen as a weakness and not just a different style of working   That's especially problematic in light of these spaces' advertised values of Openness Accessibility and Community Notable hackerspaces edit A directory is maintained at the hackerspaces org   wiki For some other notable examples see Category Hackerspaces Over the years many hackerspaces have grown significantly in membership operational budgets and local media attention Many have also helped establish other hackerspaces in nearby locations c-base     from Berlin is recognized as one of the first independent stand-alone hackerspaces in the world not affiliated with a school university or company Wired writes that \"European groups particularly in Germany have a long tradition of this kind of activity\"   Another known German hackerspace is RaumZeitLabor organizer of Trollcon   The Geek Group formed in   is a budding nonprofit hackerspace in Grand Rapids Michigan that has a large following and internet presence There are various chapters around the United States Their main focus has been as an opensource hackerspace to increase STEM education accessibility and one day become an accredited institution of higher education In 1997/98 The Lane Cove Community Men's Shed in Australia was set up to provide a substitute for \"shedless blokes\" Initial establishment was assisted with a Commonwealth grant from the Department of Health & Aged Services under the \"Healthy Seniors Grant Programme Metalab founded in   is generally considered to have pioneered the funding principles that enabled rapid spread of the concept   TechShop was the first chain of commercial hackerspaces It was launched in October   As of October   there were six TechShop locations in the US three in California and one each in North Carolina Michigan and Texas the last a partnership with the Lowe's home improvement chain In August   a group of North American hackers visited Europe \"to get a sense for the potential of European 'hacker s'\" and upon their return the groups NYC Resistor and HacDC were set up in late   with Noisebridge following in fall       Tokyo HackerSpace was initiated in     Safecast org a open data network for ionizing radiation monitoring was formed around prototyping efforts there following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster   In summer   the first Taiwanese hackerspace Openlab Taipei was organised and started s In   the community was physically located in Treasure Hill in Taipei Taiwan Based on digital art Arduino and other free software the followed FLOSS Free Libre Open Source Software rules and had Arduino s on every Wednesday until today   Dallas Makerspace DMS was founded by members of the Dallas Personal Robotics Group DPRG in       As of summer of   it has a paying membership base of   \"making it one of the largest if not the largest nonprofit volunteer-run makerspaces in the country\" according to Dallas Morning News   The first Chinese hackerspace Xinchejian was established in Shanghai in the fall of   Thereafter hackerspaces have grown in numerous cities including Beijing Shenzhen Ningbo Hangzhou and Guangzhou Chinese makers became internationally visible when the first Maker Carnival was hosted in Beijing in     Columbus Idea Foundry moved into a   000-square-foot factory in Columbus Ohio on May       They offer classes host events and have     pounds of tools   By one account it is \"the country's largest such space \"   Artisan's Asylum Somerville Massachusetts was once believed to be the largest makerspace in the world   While bigger spaces e g Columbus Idea Foundry now exist the Asylum remains a model sustainable makerspace model   Variations on Hackerspaces edit A lot of places share values similar to those purported by hackspaces whether or not they use that nomenclature A few examples follow Public Library Hackerspaces edit Public Libraries have long been a place to share resources for learning Lately some have reconsidered their roles to include providing resources for hacking and making Those generally call themselves Library makerspaces For example Chattanooga's 4th floor may have been the first use of a library as laboratory and playground for its community The User Experience UX is another public laboratory and educational facility     Or according to Forbes the first public library to open a MakerSpace is the Fayetteville Free Library   Men's Sheds edit There are over     active men's sheds in Australia Scotland England Ireland Finland and Greece as of   update   Instead of seeing themselves as \"hackers\" they describe themselves as \"shedders\" and their activities as \"shedding\" The Men's Sheds Movement is many ways parallel hackerspaces in their aims although open to anyone regardless of age or gender they tend to advertise themselves as \"men in sheds\" In some ways they can be seen as the flip side of working men's clubs as their community is drawn from a similar age group and their original aims are similar to provide recreation and education for working class men and their families Feminist Hackerspaces edit In response to the misogyny shown by the brogrammer culture that sees hackerspaces as 'male' Seattle Attic was founded in the summer of   as the first Feminist Hackerspace in the United States     They were soon followed by Double Union in San Francisco   Their founding came as a result of The Ada Initiative and their AdaCamp conferences Which has also lead to the formation of FouFem in Montreal the Mz Baltazar s Laboratory a start-up organization and feminist hackspace in Vienna the Anarchafeminist Hackerhive in San Francisco the Hacktory in Philadelphia and the Miss Despionas in Tasmania Australia   and myriad others Public School Maker/Hackerspaces edit Some public schools in the US now also include hackerspaces The first high school to open a true MakerSpace was in Sebastopol California when? citation needed and now even middle schools are starting to follow the trend Fore example White Hill Middle school in Fairfax California has now opened up their own MakerSpace with a class called \"Makers and Hackers\"   In   Penketh High School became the first school to have a school makerspace in the United Kingdom \"Spark\" was designed for students and the community being the first of it's kind in the UK   Fab Labs edit Fab labs are spaces part of a network initiated by MIT's center for bits and atoms whose goal is to enable people to \"make almost anything \" They focus heavily on digital fabrication tools Community Arts Spaces edit Many community art spaces share values with hackerspaces Some like AS220 and Haystack Mountain School of Crafts have embraced Fab lab structures to expand the range of media represented in their spaces to include digital fabrication tools University Maker/Hackerspaces edit Universities around the world have at different rates embraced educational possibilities of these spaces MIT has pioneered the Fab lab movement and implementation of similar spaces in universities around the world Non-Fab Lab associated Maker and Hackerspaces are also common Wheaton College is one school pioneering new Hacker and Maker curriculums and spaces     as is Yale University with spaces like its \"CEID \"   Franklin W Olin College of Engineering has also pioneered Makerist and Hacker curriculum to great success Broader networks for these hacker-oriented schools have arisen including MakeSchools out of CMU   and the Higher Education Makerspace Initiative a partnership that includes MIT Yale and Olin   Makerspaces edit Makerspaces and Hackerspaces as terms are often conflated and the difference between them or if in fact there even is a difference is debated Tool Library edit Tool libraries generally don't have shared space for making or hacking things but are instead serve as a repository of tools people can borrow for use in their own respective spaces Repair Cafe edit Repair caf s are places where people can come together to teach and learn how to fix things Music Hackerspaces edit A few hackerspaces exist that focus exclusively on music such as Music Hackspace London Music Hackspace Dublin CPH Music Maker Space Copenhagen Radiona Zagreb Bicycle Coops edit Bicycle cooperatives are places where people can build or fix bicycles   edit Hacker culture Maker

sending current from one part of the circuit into another Results are monitored through either the device's internal speaker or by connecting an amplifier to the speaker output If an interesting effect is achieved this connection would be marked for future reference or kept active by either soldering a new connection or bridging it with crocodile clips Often other components are inserted at these points such as pushbuttons or switches to turn the effect on or off or components such as resistors or capacitors to change the quality of the audio output This is repeated on a trial and error basis Other components added into the circuit can give the performer more expressiveness such as potentiometers photoresistors for reaction to light and pressure sensors A Yamaha PSR-6 used in a circuit bending project The simplest input and the one most identified with circuit bending is the body contact   where the performer's touch causes the circuit to change the sound Often metal knobs plates screws or studs are wired to these circuit points to give easier access to these points from the outside the case of the device Since creative experimentation   is a key element to the practice of circuit bending there is always a possibility that short circuiting may yield undesirable results including component failure In particular connecting the power supply or a capacitor directly to a computer chip lead can destroy the chip and make the device inoperable Before beginning to do circuit bending a person should learn the basic risk factors about working with electrical and electronic products including how to identify capacitors which can give a person a serious shock due to the electrical charge that they store and how to avoid risks with AC power For safety reasons a circuit bender should have a few basic electronics tools such as a multimeter an electronic testing device which measures voltage resistance and other factors It is advised that beginner circuit benders should never \"bend\" any device that gets its power from mains electricity household AC power as this would carry a serious risk of electrocution Circuit bending can also be carried out in interactive electronic audio games People modify their electronic games to enhance the quality of recordings used for fan-made projects or to change the speed of the game which results in a pitch change This makes the gameplay easier especially if the game gets impossibly fast Adding a knob or a switch to change the pitch of the game can lead to some disadvantages which include the game can change its pitch slightly when its lights are turned on and it can cause the batteries to drain out quickly on high speeds Innovators edit Although similar methods were previously used by other musicians and engineers this method of music creation is believed to have been pioneered by Reed Ghazala in the 1960s Ghazala's experience with circuit-bending began in   when a toy transistor amplifier by chance shorted-out against a metal object in his desk drawer resulting in a stream of unusual sounds   While Ghazala says that he was not the first circuit bender he coined the term Circuit Bending   and whole-heartedly promoted the proliferation of the concept and practice through his writings and internet site earning him the title \"Father of Circuit Bending\" Serge Tcherepnin designer of the Serge modular synthesizers discussed   his early experiments in the 1950s with the transistor radio in which he found sensitive circuit points in those simple electronic devices and brought them out to \"body contacts\" on the plastic chassis Prior to Mark's and Reed's experiments other pioneers also explored the body-contact idea one of the earliest being Thaddeus Cahill   whose telharmonium it is reported was also touch-sensitive Since   Swiss duo Voice Crack created music by manipulating common electronic devices in a practice they termed \"cracked everyday electronics\"

which material is joined or solidified under computer control to create a three-dimensional object   with material being added together such as liquid molecules or powder grains being fused together 3D printing is used in both rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing AM Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and typically are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File AMF file usually in sequential layers There are many different technologies like stereolithography STL or fused deposit modeling FDM Thus unlike material removed from a stock in the conventional machining process 3D printing or AM builds a three-dimensional object from computer-aided design CAD model or AMF file usually by successively adding material layer by layer   The term \"3D printing\" originally referred to a process that deposits a binder material onto a powder bed with inkjet printer heads layer by layer More recently the term is being used in popular vernacular to encompass a wider variety of additive manufacturing techniques United States and global technical standards use the official term additive

Terminology edit The umbrella term additive manufacturing AM gained wide currency in the 2000s   inspired by the theme of material being added together in any of various ways In contrast the term subtractive manufacturing appeared as a retronym for the large family of machining processes with material removal as their common theme The term 3D printing still referred only to the polymer technologies in most minds and the term AM was likelier to be used in metalworking and end use part production contexts than among polymer inkjet or stereolithography enthusiasts By the early 2010s the terms 3D printing and additive manufacturing evolved senses in which they were alternate umbrella terms for AM technologies one being used in popular vernacular by consumer-maker communities and the media and the other used more formally by industrial AM end-use part producers AM machine manufacturers and global technical standards organizations Until recently the term 3D printing has been associated with machines low-end in price or in capability   Both terms reflect that the technologies share the theme of material addition or joining throughout a 3D work envelope under automated control Peter Zelinski the editor-in-chief of Additive Manufacturing magazine pointed out in   that the terms are still often synonymous in casual usage   but that some manufacturing industry experts are increasingly making a sense distinction whereby AM comprises 3D printing plus other technologies or other aspects of a manufacturing process   Other terms that have been used as AM synonyms or hypernyms have included desktop manufacturing rapid manufacturing as the logical production-level successor to rapid prototyping and on-demand manufacturing which echoes on-demand printing in the 2D sense of printing That such application of the adjectives rapid and on-demand to the noun manufacturing was novel in the 2000s reveals the prevailing mental model of the long industrial era in which almost all production manufacturing involved long lead times for laborious tooling development Today the term subtractive has not replaced the term machining instead complementing it when a term that covers any removal method is needed Agile tooling is the use of modular means to design tooling that is produced by additive manufacturing or 3D printing methods to enable quick prototyping and responses to tooling and fixture needs Agile tooling uses a cost effective and high quality method to quickly respond to customer and market needs and it can be used in hydro-forming stamping injection molding and other manufacturing processes History edit   Early additive manufacturing equipment and materials were developed in the 1980s   In   Hideo Kodama of Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute invented two additive methods for fabricating three-dimensional plastic models with photo-hardening thermoset polymer where the UV exposure area is controlled by a mask pattern or a scanning fiber transmitter       On   July   Alain Le M haut Olivier de Witte and Jean Claude Andr filed their patent for the stereolithography process   The application of the French inventors was abandoned by the French General Electric Company now Alcatel-Alsthom and CILAS The Laser Consortium   The claimed reason was \"for lack of business perspective\"     Three weeks later in   Chuck Hull of 3D Systems Corporation   filed his own patent for a stereolithography fabrication system in which layers are added by curing photopolymers with ultraviolet light lasers Hull defined the process as a \"system for generating three-dimensional objects by creating a cross-sectional pattern of the object to be formed \"     Hull's contribution was the STL Stereolithography file format and the digital slicing and infill strategies common to many processes today   The technology used by most 3D printers to date especially hobbyist and consumer-oriented models is fused deposition modeling a special application of plastic extrusion developed in   by S Scott Crump and commercialized by his company Stratasys which marketed its first FDM machine in     The term 3D printing originally referred to a powder bed process employing standard and custom inkjet print heads developed at MIT in   and commercialized by Soligen Technologies Extrude Hone Corporation and Z Corporation   The year   also saw the start of a company called Solidscape introducing a high-precision polymer jet fabrication system with soluble support structures categorized as a \"dot-on-dot\" technique   In   the Fraunhofer Institute developed the selective laser melting process AM processes for metal sintering or melting such as selective laser sintering direct metal laser sintering and selective laser melting usually went by their own individual names in the   s and   s At the time all metalworking was done by processes that we now call non-additive casting fabrication stamping and machining although plenty of automation was applied to those technologies such as by robot welding and CNC the idea of a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape with a toolpath was associated in metalworking only with processes that removed metal rather than adding it such as CNC milling CNC EDM and many others But the automated techniques that added metal which would later be called additive manufacturing were beginning to challenge that assumption By the mid-1990s new techniques for material deposition were developed at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University including microcasting   and sprayed materials   Sacrificial and support materials had also become more common enabling new object geometries   As the various additive processes matured it became clear that soon metal removal would no longer be the only metalworking process done through a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer The 2010s were the first decade in which metal end use parts such as engine brackets   and large nuts   would be grown either before or instead of machining in job production rather than obligately being machined from bar stock or plate It is still the case that casting fabrication stamping and machining are more prevalent than AM in metalworking but AM is now beginning to make significant inroads and with the advantages of design for additive manufacturing it is clear to engineers that much more is to come As technology matured several authors had begun to speculate that 3D printing could aid in sustainable development in the developing world       Fused Deposition Modeling FDM printing process patents expired in     General principles edit Modeling edit CAD model used for 3D printing 3D models are generated from 2D pictures taken at the Fantasitron 3D photo booth at Madurodam   3D modeling 3D printable models may be created with a computer-aided design CAD package via a 3D scanner or by a plain digital camera and photogrammetry software 3D printed models created with CAD result in reduced errors and can be corrected before printing allowing verification in the design of the object before it is printed   The manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting 3D scanning is a process of collecting digital data on the shape and appearance of a real object creating a digital model based on it Printing edit Play media Timelapse video of a hyperboloid object designed by George W Hart made of PLA using a RepRap \"Prusa Mendel\" 3D printer for molten polymer deposition Before printing a 3D model from an STL file it must first be examined for errors Most CAD applications produce errors in output STL files     of the following types holes faces normals self-intersections noise shells manifold errors   A step in the STL generation known as \"repair\" fixes such problems in the original model     Generally STLs that have been produced from a model obtained through 3D scanning often have more of these errors   This is due to how 3D scanning works-as it is often by point to point acquisition reconstruction will include errors in most cases   Once completed the STL file needs to be processed by a piece of software called a \"slicer \" which converts the model into a series of thin layers and produces a G-code file containing instructions tailored to a specific type of 3D printer FDM printers citation needed This G-code file can then be printed with 3D printing client software which loads the G-code and uses it to instruct the 3D printer during the 3D printing process Printer resolution describes layer thickness and X Y resolution in dots per inch dpi or micrometers m Typical layer thickness is around   m   DPI although some machines can print layers as thin as   m     DPI   X Y resolution is comparable to that of laser printers The particles 3D dots are around   to   m   to   DPI in diameter citation needed For that printer resolution specifying a mesh resolution of         mm and a chord length     mm generate an optimal STL output file for a given model input file   Specifying higher resolution results in larger files without increase in print quality Construction of a model with contemporary methods can take anywhere from several hours to several days depending on the method used and the size and complexity of the model Additive systems can typically reduce this time to a few hours although it varies widely depending on the type of machine used and the size and number of models being produced simultaneously   Traditional techniques like injection moulding can be less expensive for manufacturing polymer products in high quantities but additive manufacturing can be faster more flexible and less expensive when producing relatively small quantities of parts 3D printers give designers and concept development teams the ability to produce parts and concept models using a desktop size printer   Seemingly paradoxic more complex objects can be cheaper for 3D printing production than less complex objects citation needed Finishing edit Though the printer-produced resolution is sufficient for many applications printing a slightly oversized version of the desired object in standard resolution and then removing material   with a higher-resolution subtractive process can achieve greater precision The layered structure of all AM processes leads involuntarily to a strain-stepping effect on part surfaces which are curved or tilted in respect to the building platform The effects strongly depend on the orientation of a part surface inside the building process   Some printable polymers such as ABS allow the surface finish to be smoothed and improved using chemical vapor processes   based on acetone or similar solvents Some additive manufacturing techniques are capable of using multiple materials in the course of constructing parts These techniques are able to print in multiple colors and color combinations simultaneously and would not necessarily require painting Some printing techniques require internal supports to be built for overhanging features during construction These supports must be mechanically removed or dissolved upon completion of the print All of the commercialized metal 3D printers involve cutting the metal component off the metal substrate after deposition A new process for the GMAW 3D printing allows for substrate surface modifications to remove aluminum   or steel   Processes and printers edit   3D printing processes This section should include only a brief summary of 3D printing processes See Wikipedia Summary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this article's main text August   Schematic representation of the 3D printing technique known as Fused Filament Fabrication a filament a of plastic material is fed through a heated moving head b that melts and extrudes it depositing it layer after layer in the desired shape c A moving platform e lowers after each layer is deposited For this kind of technology additional vertical support structures d are needed to sustain overhanging parts Play media A timelapse video of a robot model logo of Make magazine being printed using FDM on a RepRapPro Fisher printer A large number of additive processes are available The main differences between processes are in the way layers are deposited to create parts and in the materials that are used Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks which is why some companies offer a choice of powder and polymer for the material used to build the object   Others sometimes use standard off-the-shelf business paper as the build material to produce a durable prototype The main considerations in choosing a machine are generally speed costs of the 3D printer of the printed prototype choice and cost of the materials and color capabilities   Printers that work directly with metals are generally expensive However less expensive printers can be used to make a mold which is then used to make metal parts   ISO/ASTM52900-15 defines seven categories of Additive Manufacturing AM processes within its meaning binder jetting directed energy deposition material extrusion material jetting powder bed fusion sheet lamination and vat photopolymerization   Some methods melt or soften the material to produce the layers In Fused filament fabrication also known as Fused deposition modeling FDM the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers A filament of thermoplastic metal wire or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head 3D printer extruder which heats the material and turns the flow on and off FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece   Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering with both metals and polymers and direct metal laser sintering   Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties similar to those of conventional manufactured metals Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts e g titanium alloys EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum     Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder plaster or resins and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process With laminated object manufacturing thin layers are cut to shape and joined together Schematic representation of Stereolithography a light-emitting device a laser or DLP selectively illuminate the transparent bottom c of a tank b filled with a liquid photo-polymerizing resin the solidified resin d is progressively dragged up by a lifting platform e Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies such as stereolithography Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers between   and   m until the part is completed Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately without post-curing Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away Feature sizes of under   nm are easily produced as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts   Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs   In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it in the shape of the layer   Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light the \"window\" which causes the resin to solidify The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object   In powder-fed directed-energy deposition a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment     As of December   additive manufacturing systems were on the market that ranged from $99 to $500   in price and were employed in industries including aerospace architecture automotive defense and medical replacements among many others For example General Electric uses the high-end model to build parts for turbines   Many of these systems are used for rapid prototyping before mass production methods are employed Higher education has proven to be a major buyer of desktop and professional 3D printers which industry experts generally view as a positive indicator   Libraries around the world have also become locations to house smaller 3D printers for educational and community access   Several projects and companies are making efforts to develop affordable 3D printers for home desktop use Much of this work has been driven by and targeted at DIY / Maker /enthusiast/ early adopter communities with additional ties to the academic and hacker communities   Applications edit   Applications of 3D printing The Audi RSQ was made with rapid prototyping industrial KUKA robots A 3D selfie in     scale printed by Shapeways using gypsum-based printing A Jet Engine turbine printed from the Howard Community College Makerbot 3D printed enamelled pottery 3D printed sculpture of the Egyptian Pharaoh Merankhre Mentuhotep shown at Threeding In the current scenario 3D printing or AM has been used in manufacturing medical industry and sociocultural sectors which facilitate 3D printing or AM to become successful commercial technology   The earliest application of additive manufacturing was on the toolroom end of the manufacturing spectrum For example rapid prototyping was one of the earliest additive variants and its mission was to reduce the lead time and cost of developing prototypes of new parts and devices which was earlier only done with subtractive toolroom methods such as CNC milling turning and precision grinding   In the 2010s additive manufacturing entered production to a much greater extent Additive manufacturing of food is being developed by squeezing out food layer by layer into three-dimensional objects A large variety of foods are appropriate candidates such as chocolate and candy and flat foods such as crackers pasta   and pizza     3D printing has entered the world of clothing with fashion designers experimenting with 3D-printed bikinis shoes and dresses   In commercial production Nike is using 3D printing to prototype and manufacture the   Vapor Laser Talon football shoe for players of American football and New Balance is 3D manufacturing custom-fit shoes for athletes     3D printing has come to the point where companies are printing consumer grade eyewear with on-demand custom fit and styling although they cannot print the lenses On-demand customization of glasses is possible with rapid prototyping   Vanessa Friedman fashion director and chief fashion critic at The New York Times says 3D printing will have a significant value for fashion companies down the road especially if it transforms into a print-it-yourself tool for shoppers \"There's real sense that this is not going to happen anytime soon \" she says \"but it will happen and it will create dramatic change in how we think both about intellectual property and how things are in the supply chain \" She adds \"Certainly some of the fabrications that brands can use will be dramatically changed by technology \"   In cars trucks and aircraft AM is beginning to transform both   unibody and fuselage design and production and   powertrain design and production For example In early   Swedish supercar manufacturer Koenigsegg announced the One   a supercar that utilizes many components that were 3D printed   Urbee is the name of the first car in the world car mounted using the technology 3D printing its bodywork and car windows were \"printed\"       In   Local Motors debuted Strati a functioning vehicle that was entirely 3D Printed using ABS plastic and carbon fiber except the powertrain   In May   Airbus announced that its new Airbus A350 XWB included over   components manufactured by 3D printing   In   a Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet flew with printed parts The United States Air Force has begun to work with 3D printers and the Israeli Air Force has also purchased a 3D printer to print spare parts   In   GE Aviation revealed that it had used design for additive manufacturing to create a helicopter engine with   parts instead of   with great potential impact on reducing the complexity of supply chains   AM's impact on firearms involves two dimensions new manufacturing methods for established companies and new possibilities for the making of do-it-yourself firearms In   the US-based group Defense Distributed disclosed plans to design a working plastic 3D printed firearm \"that could be downloaded and reproduced by anybody with a 3D printer \"     After Defense Distributed released their plans questions were raised regarding the effects that 3D printing and widespread consumer-level CNC machining     may have on gun control effectiveness         Surgical uses of 3D printing-centric therapies have a history beginning in the mid-1990s with anatomical modeling for bony reconstructive surgery planning   Patient-matched implants were a natural extension of this work leading to truly personalized implants that fit one unique individual   Virtual planning of surgery and guidance using 3D printed personalized instruments have been applied to many areas of surgery including total joint replacement and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction with great success   One example of this is the bioresorbable trachial splint to treat newborns with tracheobronchomalacia   developed at the University of Michigan The use of additive manufacturing for serialized production of orthopedic implants metals is also increasing due to the ability to efficiently create porous surface structures that facilitate osseointegration The hearing aid and dental industries are expected to be the biggest area of future development using the custom 3D printing technology   In March   surgeons in Swansea used 3D printed parts to rebuild the face of a motorcyclist who had been seriously injured in a road accident   As of   update 3D bio-printing technology has been studied by biotechnology firms and academia for possible use in tissue engineering applications in which organs and body parts are built using inkjet techniques In this process layers of living cells are deposited onto a gel medium or sugar matrix and slowly built up to form three-dimensional structures including vascular systems   Recently a heart-on-chip has been created which matches properties of cells   In   academic journals had begun to report on the possible artistic applications of 3D printing technology   As of   domestic 3D printing was reaching a consumer audience beyond hobbyists and enthusiasts Off the shelf machines were incerasingly capable of producing practical household applications for example ornamental objects Some practical examples include a working clock   and gears printed for home woodworking machines among other purposes   Web sites associated with home 3D printing tended to include backscratchers coat hooks door knobs etc   3D printing and open source 3D printers in particular are the latest technology making inroads into the classroom       Some authors have claimed that 3D printers offer an unprecedented \"revolution\" in STEM education   The evidence for such claims comes from both the low cost ability for rapid prototyping in the classroom by students but also the fabrication of low-cost high-quality scientific equipment from open hardware designs forming open-source labs   Future applications for 3D printing might include creating open-source scientific equipment     In the last several years 3D printing has been intensively used by in the cultural heritage field for preservation restoration and dissemination purposes   Many Europeans and North American Museums have purchased 3D printers and actively recreate missing pieces of their relics   The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the British Museum have started using their 3D printers to create museum souvenirs that are available in the museum shops   Other museums like the National Museum of Military History and Varna Historical Museum have gone further and sell through the online platform Threeding digital models of their artifacts created using Artec 3D scanners in 3D printing friendly file format which everyone can 3D print at home   3D printed soft actuators is a growing application of 3D printing technology which has found its place in the 3D printing applications These soft actuators are being developed to deal with soft structures and organs especially in biomedical sectors and where the interaction between human and robot is inevitable The majority of the existing soft actuators are fabricated by conventional methods that require manual fabrication of devices post processing/assembly and lengthy iterations until maturity in the fabrication is achieved To avoid the tedious and time-consuming aspects of the current fabrication processes researchers are exploring an appropriate manufacturing approach for effective fabrication of soft actuators Thus 3D printed soft actuators are introduced to revolutionise the design and fabrication of soft actuators with custom geometrical functional and control properties in a faster and inexpensive approach They also enable incorporation of all actuator components into a single structure eliminating the need to use external joints adhesives and fasteners   Legal aspects edit Intellectual property edit   Free hardware 3D printing has existed for decades within certain manufacturing industries where many legal regimes including patents industrial design rights copyright and trademark may apply However there is not much jurisprudence to say how these laws will apply if 3D printers become mainstream and individuals and hobbyist communities begin manufacturing items for personal use for non-profit distribution or for sale Any of the mentioned legal regimes may prohibit the distribution of the designs used in 3D printing or the distribution or sale of the printed item To be allowed to do these things where an active intellectual property was involved a person would have to contact the owner and ask for a licence which may come with conditions and a price However many patent design and copyright laws contain a standard limitation or exception for 'private' 'non-commercial' use of inventions designs or works of art protected under intellectual property IP That standard limitation or exception may leave such private non-commercial uses outside the scope of IP rights Patents cover inventions including processes machines manufactures and compositions of matter and have a finite duration which varies between countries but generally   years from the date of application Therefore if a type of wheel is patented printing using or selling such a wheel could be an infringement of the patent   Copyright covers an expression   in a tangible fixed medium and often lasts for the life of the author plus   years thereafter   If someone makes a statue they may have copyright on the look of that statue so if someone sees that statue they cannot then distribute designs to print an identical or similar statue When a feature has both artistic copyrightable and functional patentable merits when the question has appeared in US court the courts have often held the feature is not copyrightable unless it can be separated from the functional aspects of the item   In other countries the law and the courts may apply a different approach allowing for example the design of a useful device to be registered as a whole as an industrial design on the understanding that in case of unauthorized copying only the non-functional features may be claimed under design law whereas any technical features could only be claimed if covered by a valid patent Gun legislation and administration edit   3D printed firearms The US Department of Homeland Security and the Joint Regional Intelligence Center released a memo stating that \"significant advances in three-dimensional 3D printing capabilities availability of free digital 3D printable files for firearms components and difficulty regulating file sharing may present public safety risks from unqualified gun seekers who obtain or manufacture 3D printed guns\" and that \"proposed legislation to ban 3D printing of weapons may deter but cannot completely prevent their production Even if the practice is prohibited by new legislation online distribution of these 3D printable files will be as difficult to control as any other illegally traded music movie or software files \"   Attempting to restrict the distribution of gun plans via the Internet has been likened to the futility of preventing the widespread distribution of DeCSS which enabled DVD ripping         After the US government had Defense Distributed take down the plans they were still widely available via the Pirate Bay and other file sharing sites   Downloads of the plans from the UK Germany Spain and Brazil were heavy     Some US legislators have proposed regulations on 3D printers to prevent them from being used for printing guns     3D printing advocates have suggested that such regulations would be futile could cripple the 3D printing industry and could infringe on free speech rights with early pioneer of 3D printing Professor Hod Lipson suggesting that gunpowder could be controlled instead               Internationally where gun controls are generally stricter than in the United States some commentators have said the impact may be more strongly felt since alternative firearms are not as easily obtainable   Officials in the United Kingdom have noted that producing a 3D printed gun would be illegal under their gun control laws   Europol stated that criminals have access to other sources of weapons but noted that as technology improves the risks of an effect would increase     Aerospace regulation edit In the United States the FAA has anticipated a desire to use additive manufacturing techniques and has been considering how best to regulate this process   The FAA has jurisdiction over such fabrication because all aircraft parts must be made under FAA production approval or under other FAA regulatory categories   In December   the FAA approved the production of a 3D printed fuel nozzle for the GE LEAP engine   Aviation attorney Jason Dickstein has suggested that additive manufacturing is merely a production method and should be regulated like any other production method     He has suggested that the FAA's focus should be on guidance to explain compliance rather than on changing the existing rules and that existing regulations and guidance permit a company \"to develop a robust quality system that adequately reflects regulatory needs for quality assurance \"   As of January   Health and safety edit Play media A video on research done on printer emissions   Health and safety hazards of nanomaterials Research on the health and safety concerns of 3D printing is new and in development due to the recent proliferation of 3D printing devices In   the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work has published a discussion paper on the processes and materials involved in 3D printing potential implications of this technology for occupational safety and health and avenues for controlling potential hazards   Most concerns involve gas and material exposures in particular nanomaterials material handling static electricity moving parts and pressures   A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH study noted particle emissions from a fused filament peaked a few minutes after printing started and returned to baseline levels   minutes after printing ended   Emissions from fused filament printers can include a large number of ultrafine particles and volatile organic compounds VOCs       The toxicity from emissions varies by source material due to differences in size chemical properties and quantity of emitted particles   Excessive exposure to VOCs can lead to irritation of the eyes nose and throat headache loss of coordination and nausea and some of the chemical emissions of fused filament printers have also been linked to asthma     Based on animal studies carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers sometimes used in fused filament printing can cause pulmonary effects including inflammation granulomas and pulmonary fibrosis when at the nanoparticle size   Carbon nanoparticle emissions and processes using powder metals are highly combustible and raise the risk of dust explosions   At least one case of severe injury was noted from an explosion involved in metal powders used for fused filament printing   Other general health and safety concerns include the hot surface of UV lamps and print head blocks high voltage ultraviolet radiation from UV lamps and potential for mechanical injury from moving parts   The problems noted in the NIOSH report were reduced by using manufacturer-supplied covers and full enclosures using proper ventilation keeping workers away from the printer using respirators turning off the printer if it jammed and using lower emission printers and filaments   At least one case of severe injury was noted from an explosion involved in metal powders used for fused filament   Personal protective equipment has been found to be the least desirable control method with a recommendation that it only be used to add further protection in combination with approved emissions protection   Hazards to health and safety also exist from post-processing activities done to finish parts after they have been printed These post-processing activities can include chemical baths sanding polishing or vapor exposure to refine surface finish as well as general subtractive manufacturing techniques such as drilling milling or turning to modify the printed geometry   Any technique that removes material from the printed part has the potential to generate particles that can be inhaled or cause eye injury if proper personal protective equipment is not used such as respirators or safety glasses Caustic baths are often used to dissolve support material used by some 3D printers that allows them to print more complex shapes These baths require personal protective equipment to prevent injury to exposed skin   Health regulation edit Although no occupational exposure limits specific to 3D printer emissions exist certain source materials used in 3D printing such as carbon nanofiber and carbon nanotubes have established occupational exposure limits at the nanoparticle size     Impact edit Additive manufacturing starting with today's infancy period requires manufacturing firms to be flexible ever-improving users of all available technologies to remain competitive Advocates of additive manufacturing also predict that this arc of technological development will counter globalization as end users will do much of their own manufacturing rather than engage in trade to buy products from other people and corporations   The real integration of the newer additive technologies into commercial production however is more a matter of complementing traditional subtractive methods rather than displacing them entirely   The futurologist Jeremy Rifkin   claimed that 3D printing signals the beginning of a third industrial revolution   succeeding the production line assembly that dominated manufacturing starting in the late 19th century Social change edit Since the 1950s a number of writers and social commentators have speculated in some depth about the social and cultural changes that might result from the advent of commercially affordable additive manufacturing technology   Amongst the more notable ideas to have emerged from these inquiries has been the suggestion that as more and more 3D printers start to enter people's homes the conventional relationship between the home and the workplace might get further eroded   Likewise it has also been suggested that as it becomes easier for businesses to transmit designs for new objects around the globe so the need for high-speed freight services might also become less   Finally given the ease with which certain objects can now be replicated it remains to be seen whether changes will be made to current copyright legislation so as to protect intellectual property rights with the new technology widely available As 3D printers became more accessible to consumers online social platforms have developed to support the community   This includes websites that allow users to access information such as how to build a 3D printer as well as social forums that discuss how to improve 3D print quality and discuss 3D printing news as well as social media websites that are dedicated to share 3D models       RepRap is a wiki based website that was created to hold all information on 3d printing and has developed into a community that aims to bring 3D printing to everyone Furthermore there are other sites such as Pinshape Thingiverse and MyMiniFactory which were created initially to allow users to post 3D files for anyone to print allowing for decreased transaction cost of sharing 3D files These websites have allowed greater social interaction between users creating communities dedicated to 3D printing Some call attention to the conjunction of Commons-based peer production with 3D printing and other low-cost manufacturing techniques       The self-reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of economies of scope and here society can play an important role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customized productivity   Further it is true that many issues problems and threats arise due to the democratization of the means of production and especially regarding the physical ones   For instance the recyclability of advanced nanomaterials is still questioned weapons manufacturing could become easier not to mention the implications for counterfeiting   and on IP   It might be maintained that in contrast to the industrial paradigm whose competitive dynamics were about economies of scale Commons-based peer production 3D printing could develop economies of scope While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation the economies of scope share infrastructure costs intangible and tangible productive resources taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools   And following Neil Gershenfeld   in that \"some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most advanced technologies \" Commons-based peer production and 3D printing may offer the necessary tools for thinking globally but acting locally in response to certain needs Larry Summers wrote about the \"devastating consequences\" of 3D printing and other technologies robots artificial intelligence etc for those who perform routine tasks In his view \"already there are more American men on disability insurance than doing production work in manufacturing And the trends are all in the wrong direction particularly for the less skilled as the capacity of capital embodying artificial intelligence to replace white-collar as well as blue-collar work will increase rapidly in the years ahead \" Summers recommends more vigorous cooperative efforts to address the \"myriad devices\" e g tax havens bank secrecy money laundering and regulatory arbitrage enabling the holders of great wealth to \"avoid paying\" income and estate taxes and to make it more difficult to accumulate great fortunes without requiring \"great social contributions\" in return including more vigorous enforcement of anti-monopoly laws reductions in \"excessive\" protection for intellectual property greater encouragement of profit-sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements improvements in corporate governance strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity easing of land-use restrictions that may cause the real estate of the rich to keep rising in value better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers and increased public and private investment in infrastructure development e g in energy production and transportation   Michael Spence wrote that \"Now comes a powerful wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks This process of labor substitution and disintermediation has been underway for some time in service sectors think of ATMs online banking enterprise resource planning customer relationship management mobile payment systems and much more This revolution is spreading to the production of goods where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor \" In his view the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start in the design of hardware e g 3D printers and more important in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks \"Once this is achieved the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low and declines as scale rises and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing the incentives to invest in digital technologies are compelling \"   Spence believes that unlike prior digital technologies which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies \"is cost reduction via the replacement of labor \" For example as the cost of 3D printing technology declines it is \"easy to imagine\" that production may become \"extremely\" local and customized Moreover production may occur in response to actual demand not anticipated or forecast demand Spence believes that labor no matter how inexpensive will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion with labor-intensive process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective and that re-localization will appear in both developed and developing countries In his view production will not disappear but it will be less labor-intensive and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion Spence writes that \"the world we are entering is one in which the most powerful global flows will be ideas and digital capital not goods services and traditional capital Adapting to this will require shifts in mindsets policies investments especially in human capital and quite possibly models of employment and distribution \"   Naomi Wu regards the usage of 3D printing in the Chinese

to remove this template message A prosumer is a person who consumes and produces a product It is derived from \"prosumption\" a dot-com era business term meaning \"production by consumers\" These terms were coined in   by American futurist Alvin Toffler and were widely used by many technology writers of the time Today it generally refers to a person using commons-based peer production \"Prosumer\" is also a trade term used from a business perspective for high-end electronic devices such as digital cameras meaning a price point between \"professional\" and \"consumer\" devices Contents   Definitions and origins     General meanings of \"prosumer\" no relationship to the business term \"prosumption\"     Producer and consumer     Professional consumer     Non-corporate

origins edit This blurring of the roles of consumers and producers has its origins in the cooperative self-help movements that sprang up during various economic crises e g the Great Depression in the 1930s General meanings of \"prosumer\" no relationship to the business term \"prosumption\" edit Enthusiasts who buy products almost always technical that fall between professional and consumer grade standards in quality complexity or functionality Prosumer also commonly refers to those products Semiprofessional \"Prosumer\" is a well-accepted category for camcorders digital cameras VCRs \"and other video playthings \"   These advanced product features and higher prosumer expectations lend themselves to increased customizing in Toffler's product-improvement sense see the next section Producer and consumer edit Marshall McLuhan and Barrington Nevitt suggested in their   book Take Today p   that with electric technology the consumer would become a producer In the   book The Third Wave futurologist Alvin Toffler coined the term \"prosumer\" when he predicted that the role of producers and consumers would begin to blur and merge even though he described it in his book Future Shock from   Toffler envisioned a highly saturated marketplace as mass production of standardized products began to satisfy basic consumer demands To continue growing profit businesses would initiate a process of mass customization that is the mass production of highly customized products However to reach a high degree of customization consumers would have to take part in the production process especially in specifying design requirements In a sense this is merely an extension or broadening of the kind of relationship that many affluent clients have had with professionals like architects for many decades However in many cases architectural clients are not the only or even primary end-consumers a distinction touched upon in the H+ Magazine essay 'Prosumption Architecture The Decentralization of Architectural Agency as an Economic Imperative'   Toffler has extended these and many other ideas well into the 21st-century Along with more recently published works such as Revolutionary Wealth   we can recognize and assess both the concept and fact of the prosumer as it is seen and felt on a worldwide scale That these concepts are having global impact and reach however can be measured in part by noting in particular Toffler's popularity in China Discussing some of these issues with Newt Gingrich on C-SPAN 's After Words program in June   Toffler mentioned that The Third Wave is the second ranked bestseller of all time in China just behind a work by Mao Zedong   Don Tapscott reintroduced the concept in his   book The Digital Economy Despite several decades of usage the term only recently began to receive full theoretical elaboration George Ritzer and Nathan Jurgenson in a widely cited article claim that prosumption has become a salient characteristic of Web     Prosumers create value for companies without receiving wages Mass customization has not taken place in most areas of the economy Mass customization has ruled the food & beverage industry for years Look at how many choices we are faced with in the grocery stores and supermarkets Brand extension and dilution are ways companies have sold more under various names giving us thousands of choices Most consumption continues to be passive as critics of television recorded music and fast food would argue Indeed people are generally uninterested in going to the effort of customizing the myriad products that comprise modern consumer culture In The Paradox of Choice Why More is Less Barry Schwartz argues that diminishing returns from a confusing abundance of consumer choice is producing stress and dissatisfaction   Still one key area of high-customization is taking place highly involved hobbyists In the digital and online world Prosumer is used to describe today's online buyers because not only are they consumers of products but they are able to produce their own products such as customised handbags jewellery with initials jumpers with team logos etc In the field of renewable energy prosumers are households or organisations which at times produce surplus fuel or energy and feed it into a national or local distribution network whilst at other times when their fuel or energy requirements outstrip their own production of it they consume that same fuel or energy from that grid This is widely done by households by means of PV panels on their roofs generating electricity Such households may additionally make use of battery storage to increase their share of self-consumed PV electricity referred to as prosumage in the literature     It is also done by businesses which produce biogas and feed it into a gas network while using gas from the same network at other times or in other places The European Union s Nobel Grid project which is part of their Horizon   research and innovation programme uses the term in this way for example Professional consumer edit With customization focused on leisure pursuits Toffler's initial combination has been largely supplanted by a second pair of blurring roles that of the professional and consumer In particular hobbyists have become ever-more demanding in the pursuits of their hobbies often rising above the level of dilettante an amateur someone who dabbles in a field out of casual interest rather than as a profession or serious interest to the point of commanding skills equal to that of professionals Key examples of such hobbies are home improvement as illustrated by the rise of hardware stores such as Home Depot cooking as illustrated by creation of entirely new cable television channels entirely dedicated to the culinary arts such as The Food Channel or Food Network photography as illustrated by camcorders and still cameras that are often on par with equipment used by professionals This professional slant of the prosumer term is most common in photography which is a field that highlights prosumer trends Access to professional-level equipment and skills is made possible by combination of factors such as high disposable incomes by some sectors of the population increased leisure time again for some sectors of the population continuously falling prices of ever more advanced products especially electronics media geared towards amateurs and hobbyists beginning in the 1980s with the advent of desktop publishing a growing profusion of magazines to satisfy specialized interests beginning in the mid-1990s with the advent of the Internet an even wider range of websites with online forums to pool experience Pertaining to electronics are considered to be \"on the fence\" as a product of lower quality than a professional product and higher quality sometimes in the form of bells and whistles than a consumer product Some examples include Digital camcorders Still cameras HDTVs Toffler s Prosumption was well described and expanded in economic terms by Philip Kotler he saw Prosumer/Prosumption as a new challenge for marketers   Philip Kotler anticipated that people will also want to play larger role in designing certain goods and services they consume furthermore modern computers will permit them to do it He also described several forces that would lead to more prosumption like activities and to more sustainable lifestyles that topic was further developed by Tomasz Szymusiak in   and   in two marketing books     Non-corporate producer

especially among some activist groups That is the producer and consumer roles are being combined so as to exclude or at least diminish the role of the corporate producer thus rather than generating higher corporate profits from value-added products producers would at best be reduced to supplying lower-profit commodity inputs Indeed the more consumer-oriented prosumer spin is irrelevant to many people with diminished disposable income caused by various economic trends such as globalization automation and wealth concentration Prosumer from company perspective edit A fourth view of the Prosumer is from companies perspective who open up their processes and integrate end-users as prosumer for shared benefits Such motivated enthusiasts can be for instance integrated into a company's R&D Other benefits are strengthened relationship with the customer and faster feedback cycles Companies and individuals are increasingly utilizing and involving the end-users to develop final products and services In some instances end-users are creating products on their own without the interference or assistance of third parties i e companies organizations etc For example Lego Mindstorms allows users to download software from Lego's website so that the users can edit and update software as they wish Prosumption edit In their   book Wikinomics How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything Don Tapscott and Anthony D Williams use the related term of prosumption production/consumption also coined by Toffler to refer to the creation of products and services by the same people who will ultimately use them The book states criteria that increase the value of prosumers' participation such as openness sharing peering globalizing But empirically some criteria have inverse relationships   Impact and reception edit Adoption edit Identifiable trends and movements outside of the mainstream economy that have adopted prosumer terminology and techniques include a Do It Yourself DIY approach as a means of economic self-sufficiency or simply as a way to survive on diminished income the open source software movement creates software on their own prime example is the successful operating system Linux which now dominates the server domain Fablab movement self-fabrication capabilities especially 3d printing the voluntary simplicity movement that seeks personal social and environmental goals through prosumer activities such as growing one's own food repairing clothing and appliances rather than buying new items playing musical instruments rather than listening to recorded music use of new media-creation and distribution technologies to foster independent open non-profit \"consumer-to-consumer\" media and cultures see Wikipedia Indymedia most of Creative Commons many involved in independent media reject mass culture generated by concentrated corporate media self-sufficient barter networks notably in developing nations such as Argentina's RGT have adopted the term prosumer   Influence on a company's R & D budget edit A fourth view of the prosumer is as one who is aware the fact that the whole wealth of a company including profits interests ads wages investments etc plus waste losses taxes fines etc comes from the retail prices paid by generations of common consumers in a non- quasi- perfect concurrence market all prices are not equitable prices they are influenced by some violence on wants in the strength rate between demand and supply the difference between cost and price is the measurement of violence on wants the sense of existence itself of the whole economy is to serve the consumer retail price payers or common consumers of the same product or of different products sold by the same retailer company or users of the same branch of a supplying line can decide together as consumers join communicate organize both locally or via the Internet so that they can publish petitions offering the company ways to improve a product and its supply service ways to help the company stop wasting its main resource its consumers how to improve the marketing as often oligopolistic marketing is \"hostile marketing\" exploiting and manipulating retail price payers ways to improve positive motivations to work influence the R & D spending of a company in ways which directly benefit them For example a manufacturer of widgets has a customer who changes their requirements asking that all their widgets sing This customer is important enough that losing them would seriously hurt the company's bottom line Based on this customer's request the company direct a portion of its R & D budget to address this requirement While the customer didn t make the changes directly they did influence the company's design requirements This arrangement has positive effects for both parties for the customer immediate access to the new technology technology that meets their specific requirements for the company a strengthened relationship with the customer a demonstration of willingness to keep their customers satisfied a new feature/product/service they can market to other customers   edit Commons-based peer production Creative consumer Read/write culture Cost the

edit Sources of the open-design movement edit Sharing of manufacturing information can be traced back to the 18th and 19th century     Aggressive patenting put an end to that period of extensive knowledge sharing   More recently principles of open design have been related to the free software and open source movements   In   Eric S Raymond Tim O'Reilly and Larry Augustin established \"open source\" as an alternative expression to \"free software \" and in   Bruce Perens published the Open Source Definition In late   Dr Sepehr Kiani a PhD in mechanical engineering from MIT realized that designers could benefit from open source policies and in early   he convinced Dr Ryan Vallance and Dr Samir Nayfeh of the potential benefits of open design in machine design applications   Together they established the Open Design Foundation ODF as a non-profit corporation and set out to develop an Open Design Definition   The idea of open design was taken up either simultaneously or subsequently by several other groups and individuals The principles of open design are closely similar to those of open-source hardware design which emerged in March   when Reinoud Lamberts of the Delft University of Technology proposed on his Open Design Circuits website the creation of a hardware design community in the spirit of free software   Ronen Kadushin coined the title \"Open Design\" in his   Master s thesis and the term was later formalized in the   Open Design Manifesto   Current directions of the open-design movement edit Play media Open Source Ecology open source farming and industrial machinery The open-design movement currently unites two trends On one hand people apply their skills and time on projects for the common good perhaps where funding or commercial interest is lacking for developing countries or to help spread ecological or cheaper technologies On the other hand open design may provide a framework for developing advanced projects and technologies that might be beyond the resource of any single company or country and involve people who without the copyleft mechanism might not collaborate otherwise There is now also a third trend where these two methods come together to use high-tech open-source e g 3D printing but customized local solutions for sustainable development   Open Design holds great potential in driving future innovation as resent research has proven that stakeholder users working together produce more innovative designs than designers consulting users through more traditional means   Open machine design as compared to open-source software edit The open-design movement is currently fairly nascent but holds great potential for the future In some respects design and engineering are even more suited to open collaborative development than the increasingly common open-source software projects because with 3D models and photographs the concept can often be understood visually It is not even necessary that the project members speak the same languages to usefully collaborate However there are certain barriers to overcome for open design when compared to software development where there are mature and widely used tools available and the duplication and distribution of code cost next to nothing Creating testing and modifying physical designs is not quite so straightforward because of the effort time

citation needed Independent operators edit Many towns have handymen who work part-time for friends or family or neighbors who are skilled in a variety of tasks Sometimes they advertise in newspapers or online They vary in quality professionalism skill level and price Contractors often criticize the work of previous contractors and this practice is not limited to handymen but to all trades   Handymen have advertised their services through flyers and mailings in addition free websites such as Craigslist and SkillSlate help customers and handymen find each other   This entire porch was rebuilt by a handyman including the substructure columns railings 1x1s and moldings and door surrounds replacing a porch is a difficult project for amateurs Franchise businesses edit In   there were national handyman service firms which handle such nationwide tasks as public relations marketing advertising and signage but sell specific territories to franchise owners A franchise contract typically gives a franchise owner the exclusive right to take service calls within a given geographical area The websites of these firms put possible customers in touch with local owners which have handymen and trucks Customers call the local numbers Typically these firms charge around $100/hour although fees vary by locality and time of year In many parts of the world there are professional handyman firms that do small home or commercial projects which claim possible advantages such as having workers who are insured and licensed Their branch offices schedule service appointments for full-time and part-time handymen to visit and make repairs and sometimes coordinate with sub-contractors One Lehman Brothers executive after being let go from the Wall Street firm bought a Union New Jersey franchise from a national handyman firm   A franchise was approximately $110   with a franchise fee of $14   according to a spokesperson for a national handyman franchise   A handyman built this bathroom wall using two-by-four boards after electricians added the wires metal plates were put on studs to prevent nails and screws to hold drywall from going into electric wires a handyman added the drywall Some see a benefit of franchising as \"entrepreneurship under the safety net of a tried-and-true business umbrella\"   but forecast a     percent decrease in franchise businesses during the 2008-2009 recession   In   according to a survey released by the Washington-based International Franchise Association showed     franchised establishments in the United States employing some   million people   Franchises offer training advertising and information technology support lower procurement costs and access to a network of established operators   Franchise handyman firms sometimes pitch clients by asking prospective customers about their unresolved \"to-do lists \"   The firm does odd jobs carpentry and repairs   Trends such as a \"poverty of time\" and a \"glut of unhandy husbands\" has spurred the business   Technicians do a range of services including tile work painting and wallpapering   \"One firm\" charges $88 per hour   The firm targets a work category which full-fledged remodelers and contractors find unprofitable   A consumer was quoted by a reporter explaining the decision to hire one firm \"'I couldn't find anyone to come in and help me because the jobs were too small' said Meg Beck of Huntington who needed some painting and carpentry done She turned to one franchise firm and said she liked the fact that the service has well-marked trucks and uniformed technicians and that a dispatcher called with the names of the crew before they showed up \"   There are indications that these businesses are growing   There are different firms operating     Other competitors include online referral services   In addition some large home centers offer installation services for products such as cabinets and carpet installation   Sometimes homeowners contact a professional service after trying but failing to do repair work themselves in one instance a Minneapolis homeowner attempted a project but called a technician to finish the project and the overall cost was substantial   Assessment of handyman options edit Handymen have been hired to de-clutter basements and build movable shelves How well do the franchise chains perform? One Wall Street Journal reporting team did an informal assessment by hiring handymen all over the United States and asking them to fix a wide range of problems from a relatively routine leaky faucet to a sticky door   The reporter concluded that \"with few licensing requirements and standards for the industry prices are all over the board \"   One quote was ten times as large as another   Further the reporter concluded \"A big corporate name is no guarantee of quality or speedy service \"   One corporate firm took three weeks to fix a stuck door   Service varied from spotty to good with complaints about unreturned phone calls service people standing on dining room chairs leaving holes between wood planking but liked getting multiple jobs done instead of just one   Customers liked handymen wearing hospital booties to avoid tracking dirt in houses   The reporter chronicled one experience with repairing a water-damaged ceiling A franchise firm fixed it for $1   a second non-franchise local handyman fixed a similar ceiling for $125   The reporter preferred the second worker despite the fact that he \"doesn't have a fancy van -- or carry proof of insurance \"   Tips for selecting a good handyman include ask questions get written estimates on company stationery make sure handymen guarantee their work pay with credit cards or checks because this provides an additional record of each transaction check references and licenses   review feedback about the contractors from Internet sites To find a competent worker one can seek referrals from local sources such as a school or church or office park to see if a staff handyman does projects on the side as well as ask friends for referrals a general contractor might have workers who do projects on the side as well   Further one can try out a new handyman with easy projects such as cleaning gutters to see how well they perform   Tiling is another medium-level handyman job which most homeowners can do successfully provided they follow directions carefully Legal issues edit Generally in the United States there are few legal issues if an unpaid homeowner works on a project within their own home with some exceptions Some jurisdictions require paid handymen to be licensed and/or insured New Jersey for example requires all handymen who work in for-profit businesses serving residential and commercial customers to be registered and insured   Often handymen are barred from major plumbing electrical wiring or gas-fitting projects for safety reasons and authorities sometimes require workers to be licensed in particular trades However minor plumbing work such as fixing water taps connecting sinks fixing leaks or installing new washing machines are usually permitted to be done without licensing Many handymen are insured under a property damage liability policy so that accidental property damage from negligence or accidents are covered Handymen in popular culture edit The handyman image recurs in popular culture There have been songs about handymen recorded by Elvis Presley in   Del Shannon in   James Taylor in     There are femme-fatale TV characters who fall for handymen   Handymen have been portrayed in books and films generally positively as do-gooder helpful types but not particularly smart or ambitious In a book by author Carolyn See called The Handyman a handyman is really an aspiring but discouraged artist who transforms the lives of people he works for as well as having sexual encounters with some of his clients and his experiences improve his artistic output   The book suggests handymen discover \"the appalling loneliness of the women who call him for help\" whose needs are sometimes \"comic \" sometimes \"heartbreaking \" and deep down \"sexual \"   A   movie called The Handyman was about a carpenter-plumber who was \"good at what he does\" but is \"too honest and trusting \" and gets taken advantage of by \"women who find him handsome and understanding \" the movie earned negative reviews from critic Vincent Canby   Other movies have used a rather tired formula of sexy-handyman meets bored-housewives such as The Ups and Downs of a Handyman a   movie in which \"Handsome Bob also finds he's a fast favorite with the local housewives who seem to have more than small repairs on their minds \"   In Canada there's a television show called Canada's Worst Handyman which is a reality show in which handyman contestants try their best on jobs in order to not be labeled worst handyman Home Improvement is an American television sitcom starring Tim Allen which aired   to   On the children's television show Mister Rogers' Neighborhood Handyman Negri was one of the characters residing in The Neighborhood of Make-Believe as well as the neighborhood Mister Rogers resides in Handy Manny is an American/Hispanic preschool television show that airs on Disney Junior and stars a handy man cartoon character named Manny The Belgian comics and media franchise The Smurfs depicts Handy Smurf with traditional handyman's accoutrements such as overalls carpenter's pencil and work hat Happy Tree Friends also has an orange beaver named Handy who is a handyman List of handyman jobs edit The list of projects which handymen can do is extensive and varies from easy-to-learn tasks which take little time such as changing a light bulb to extensive projects which require multiple steps such as kitchen remodeling Here is a partial list Appraising of property Auto maintenance Barbecue pit maintenance Cabinet refacing Carpentry Ceiling repair

Fashion     Television       References Origin edit Bricolage is a French loanword that means the process of improvisation in a human endeavor The word is derived from the French verb bricoler \"to tinker\" with the English term DIY \"Do-it-yourself\" being the closest equivalent of the contemporary French usage In both languages bricolage also denotes any works or products of DIY endeavors     The arts edit Music edit Instrumental bricolage in music includes the use of found objects as instruments such as Spoons Musical saw Australasian slap bass made from a tea chest Comb and wax paper for humming through Gumleaf humming Lagerphone made from a stick and bottle tops Trinidadian steel drums made from industrial storage drums African drums and thumb pianos made from recycled pots and pans American super instruments made from recorders and bicycle bells or metal rods and keys Stomp dancing is an example of the use of bricolage in music and dance utilizing everyday objects such as trash cans and broom sticks to produce music Many of the musical instruments created by American composer Harry Partch utilize unusual items such as automotive hubcaps and pyrex carboys Stylistic bricolage is the inclusion of common musical devices with new uses Shuker writes \"Punk best emphasized such stylistic bricolage\"   Musical bricolage flourishes in music of sub-cultures where experimentation is part of daily life pioneers immigrants artistic communities access to resources is limited such as in remote discriminated or financially disconnected sub-cultures which limits commercial influence e g acoustic performers ghetto music hippie folk or traditional musicians and there is a political or social drive to seek individuality e g rap music peace-drives drummers' circles Unlike other bricolage fields the intimate knowledge of resources is not necessary Many punk musicians for instance are not musically trained because they believe training can discourage creativity in preference for accuracy Also careful observation and listening is not necessary it is common in spontaneous music to welcome 'errors' and disharmony Like other bricolage fields bricolage music still values trusting one's ideas and self-correcting structures such as targeted audiences citation needed Visual art edit In art bricolage is a technique or creative mode where works are constructed from various materials available or on hand and is seen as a characteristic of many postmodern works These materials may be mass-produced or \"junk\" See also Merz polystylism collage assemblage Bricolage can also be applied to theatrical forms of improvisation where the main strategy is to use the environment and materials at hand The environment is the stage and the materials are often pantomimed The use of the stage and the imaginary materials are all made up on the spot so the materials which are at hand are actually things that the players know from past experiences i e an improvisation of ordering fast food One player would start with the common phrase \"How may I help you?\" Bricolage is also applied in interior design through blending styles and accessorizing spaces with what is \"on hand\" Many designers use bricolage to come up with innovative and unique ideas Architecture edit Bricolage is considered the jumbled effect produced by the close proximity of buildings from different periods and in different architectural styles   It is also a term that is admiringly applied to the architectural work of Le Corbusier by Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter in their book Collage City suggesting that he assembled ideas from found objects of the history of architecture This in contrast to someone like Mies Van der Rohe whom they called a \"hedgehog\" for being overly focused on a narrow concept citation needed Academics edit Literature edit In literature bricolage is affected by intertextuality the shaping of a text's meanings by reference to other texts Cultural studies edit In cultural studies bricolage is used to mean the processes by which people acquire objects from across social divisions to create new cultural identities In particular it is a feature of subcultures such as the punk movement Here objects that possess one meaning or no meaning in the dominant culture are acquired and given a new often subversive meaning For example the safety pin became a form of decoration in punk culture   Social psychology edit The term \"psychological bricolage\" is used to explain the mental processes through which an individual develops novel solutions to problems by making use of previously unrelated knowledge or ideas they already possess The term introduced by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks Matthew J Karlesky and Fiona Lee     of the University of Michigan draws from two separate disciplines The first social bricolage was introduced by cultural anthropologist Claude L vi-Strauss in   L vi-Strauss was interested in how societies create novel solutions by using resources that already exist in the collective social consciousness The second \"creative cognition is an intra-psychic approach to studying how individuals retrieve and recombine knowledge in new ways Psychological bricolage therefore refers to the cognitive processes that enable individuals to retrieve and recombine previously unrelated knowledge they already possess     Psychological bricolage is an intra-individual process akin to Karl E Weick s notion of bricolage in organizations which is akin to L vi-Strauss' notion of bricolage in societies   Philosophy edit In his book The Savage Mind   English translation   French anthropologist Claude L vi-Strauss used \"bricolage\" to describe the characteristic patterns of mythological thought In his description it is opposed to the engineers' creative thinking which proceeds from goals to means Mythical thought according to L vi-Strauss attempts to re-use available materials in order to solve new problems       Jacques Derrida extends this notion to any discourse \"If one calls bricolage the necessity of borrowing one's concept from the text of a heritage which is more or less coherent or ruined it must be said that every discourse is bricoleur \"   Gilles Deleuze and F lix Guattari in their   book Anti-Oedipus identify bricolage as the characteristic mode of production of the schizophrenic producer   Education edit In the discussion of constructionism Seymour Papert discusses two styles of solving problems Contrary to the analytical style of solving problems he describes bricolage as a way to learn and solve problems by trying testing playing around Joe L Kincheloe and Shirley R Steinberg have used the term bricolage in educational research to denote the use of multiperspectival research methods In Kincheloe's conception of the research bricolage diverse theoretical traditions are employed in a broader critical theoretical/critical pedagogical context to lay the foundation for a transformative mode of multimethodological inquiry Using these multiple frameworks and methodologies researchers are empowered to produce more rigorous and praxiological insights into socio-political and educational phenomena Kincheloe and Steinberg theorize a critical multilogical epistemology and critical connected ontology to ground the research bricolage These philosophical notions provide the research bricolage with a sophisticated understanding of the complexity of knowledge production and the interrelated complexity of both researcher positionality and phenomena in the world Such complexity demands a more rigorous mode of research that is capable of dealing with the complications of socio-educational experience Such a critical form of rigor avoids the reductionism of many monological mimetic research orientations see Kincheloe     Kincheloe & Berry   Steinberg   Kincheloe McLaren & Steinberg   Information technology edit Information systems edit In information systems bricolage is used by Claudio Ciborra to describe the way in which strategic information systems SIS can be built in order to maintain successful competitive advantage over a longer period of time than standard SIS By valuing tinkering and allowing SIS to evolve from the bottom-up rather than implementing it from the top-down the firm will end up with something that is deeply rooted in the organisational culture that is specific to that firm and is much less easily imitated   Internet edit In her book Life on the Screen   Sherry Turkle discusses the concept of bricolage as it applies to problem solving in code projects and workspace productivity She advocates the \"bricoleur style\" of programming as a valid and underexamined alternative to what she describes as the conventional structured \"planner\" approach In this style of coding the programmer works without an exhaustive preliminary specification opting instead for a step-by-step growth and re-evaluation process In her essay \"Epistemological Pluralism\" Turkle writes \"The bricoleur resembles the painter who stands back between brushstrokes looks at the canvas and only after this contemplation decides what to do next \"   Visual arts edit The visual arts is a field in which individuals often integrate a variety of knowledge sets in order to produce inventive work To reach this stage artists read print materials across a wide array of disciplines as well as information from their own social identities   For instance the artist Shirin Neshat has integrated her identities as an Iranian exile and a woman in order to make complex creative and critical bodies of work   This willingness to integrate diverse knowledge sets enables artists with multiple identities to fully leverage their knowledge sets This is demonstrated by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks Chi-Ying Chen and Fiona Lee who found that individuals were shown to exhibit greater levels of innovation in tasks related to their cultural identities when they successfully integrated those identities   Business edit Karl Weick identifies the following requirements for successful bricolage in organizations   Intimate knowledge of resources Careful observation and listening Trusting one's ideas Self-correcting structures with feedback In popular culture edit Fashion edit In his essay \"Subculture The Meaning of Style\" Dick Hebdige discusses how an individual can be identified as a bricoleur when they \"appropriated another range of commodities by placing them in a symbolic ensemble which served to erase or subvert their original straight meanings\"   The fashion industry uses bricolage-like styles by incorporating items typically utilized for other purposes For example candy wrappers are woven together to produce a purse The movie Zoolander parodies this concept with \"Derelicte\" a line of clothing made from trash Television edit MacGyver is a television series in which the protagonist is the paragon of a bricoleur   creating solutions for the problem to be solved out of immediately available found objects   edit Look up bricolage in Wiktionary the free dictionary Collage D tournement Do it yourself Jugaad Jury rig Kludge Maker culture

Drawing from references as diverse as open-source culture modular design avant-garde architectural theory science fiction language theory and neuro-surgery it adopts an inclusive approach as per spatial design towards a collaborative use of design and design tools by professionals and ordinary citizen users The umbrella term citizen-centered design harnesses the notion of open-source architecture which in itself involves the non-building architecture of computer networks and goes beyond it to the movement that encompass the building design professions as a whole Citizen-centered design was spearheaded in   by academic research in leading universities such as the University of Texas SUPA   and professional practice organizations such as the Earthnomad Foundation   and ARK Tectonics   to position the citizen-centered design movement at the intersection of design and public policy In the decades that followed the movement grew to encompass various efforts around the globe from organizations and collaborations to community design centers sponsored by academic institutions The principles of the citizen-centered design movement and by extension open-source architecture were built on the body of knowledge accumulated since the 1960s on citizen participation research and practices Around the turn of the century citizen engagement research and practices were reformulated through the lens of more effective approaches and paradigms in the social and applied sciences through the seminal work of Dr Schaban-Maurer   architect urban planner and author of the deliberative design and phronetic engagement resource \"Rise of the Citizen Practitioner\"   Dr Schaban-Maurer laid out the principles and precepts of his 'Life-Experience Narrative Exchange' methodology in the Mindful Policy Engagement field which he founded in   with the ground-breaking work 'The Roles of the Citizen Practitioner in Citizen Engagement for Architecture Urban Design and Urban Planning Policy A Phronesis-Based Approach\"   The work provides rigorous theoretical basis for a body of best case studies and best practices of citizen-centered architecture urban design and urban planning as well as urban and public policy According to Dr Schaban-Maurer the LENE methodology leads to meaningful and effective design practices by integrating their processes with the principles of Phronetic Engagement and Mindful Policy into a new field of inquiry 'Mindful Policy Engagement ' Schaban-Maurer       Since then open-source architecture practitioners and academics have increased the reach and influence of the citizen-centered design movement to other fields through inter-disciplinary collaborations publications conferences and international exhibitions In the last decade open-source architecture the mindful policy engagement field and the citizen-centered design movement have spawned smaller derivative subsets of various names most prominent of which is 'social impact design' 'public interest design' and the 'open architecture network' whose adherents combine design practice with social service These early efforts decades ago are being propelled forward by new sensibilities through the continued commitment of architects urban designers planners policy-makers and other stakeholders to engage and harness the knowledge of ordinary citizens in the design

incremental microdonations and crowd-funding strategies like Sponsume and Kickstarter offer new modes of project initiation and development destabilising the traditionally feudal hierarchy of client/architect/occupant Financing of private projects increasingly moves to the public domain offering mass rather than singular ownership whereas funding of public projects can be derived from more

best it harnesses powerful network effects to scale systems effectively It is typically democratic enshrining principles of open access and participation though political variations range from stealth authoritarianism to communitarian consensualism Traditional developments require engagement programmes in which the 'community' is 'consulted' with respect to incoming developments often with blunt tools such as focus groups which often result in lack of representation and input or at worst can result in NIMBYism With crowd-funded models forms of engagement are built into the process enabling a kind of emergent urbanism in which use of space is optimised on terms set by its users This reclamation of people's power can be seen as a soft spatial version of Hacktivism Open-source architecture

buildings Organized campaigns of fear uncertainty and doubt are probable Standards edit An important aspect of open-source architecture is the emergence of open standards of collaboration The establishment of common open modular standards such as the grid proposed by the OpenStructures project   addresses the problem of hardware compatibility and the interface between components allowing collaborative efforts across networks in which everyone designs for everyone The establishment of universal standards also encourages the growth of networks of non-monetary exchange knowledge parts components ideas and remote collaboration Design edit Mass customisation replaces standardisation as algorithms enable the generation of related but differentiated species of design objects Parametric design tools like Grasshopper GenerativeComponents Revit and Digital Project enable new user groups to interact with navigate and modify the virtual designs and to test and experience arrays of options at unprecedented low cost recognizing laypeople as design decision making agents rather than just consumers Open-source codes and scripts enable design communities to share and compare information and to collectively optimise production through modular components accelerating the historical accumulation of shared knowledge BIM Building Information Modelling and related collaboration tools and practices enable cross-disciplinary co-location of design information and integration of a range of platforms and timescales Rapid prototyping and other 3D printing technologies enable instant production of physical artefacts both representational and functional even at an architectural scale to an ever-wider audience There are severe criticisms of the use of currently popular design software however because of the impossibility of future residents and users to access them P2P Urbanism promotes low-tech design solutions that collect traditionally-derived design knowledge and makes it available on an open-source web platform This focus instead promotes traditional local materials and building techniques in vernacular architecture and is entirely distinct from that of the virtual design groups focusing upon the extremely expensive parametric design The proponents of P2P Urbanism also philosophically oppose what they see as \"fashionable\" design approaches because of a link to unsustainable products strong commercial interests and total control by only a few participants which is the opposite of opening up design to the whole population In their view the point of open-source design should be to facilitate users designing and building their own dwellings not to continue promoting a design elite that includes current starchitects Construction edit The burgeoning open-source hardware movement enables sharing of and collaboration on the hardware involved in designing kinetic or smart environments that tightly integrate software hardware and mechanisms Through these various tools informed by sensor data design becomes an ongoing evolutionary process as opposed to the one-off disjointed fire-and-forget method of traditional design This is an acknowledgement of the fact that design has always been an unending process as well as a collaboration between users and designers Operating systems for the design construction and occupancy phases become possible created as open platforms stimulating a rich ecosystem of 'apps' Various practices jostle to become the Linux of architectural software engaging in 'platform plays' at different scales rather than delivery of plans and sections Embedded sensing and computing increasingly mesh all materials within the larger \" Internet of things \" evolving ever closer towards Bruce Sterling 's vision of a world of Spimes Materials communicate their position and state during fabrication and construction aiding positioning fixing and verification and continue to communicate with distributed databases for the extent of their lifetime Occupancy edit Today s OSArc enables inhabitants to control and shape their personal environment to Inhabit is to Design as John Habraken put it This aspect is enhanced by today s fully sentient networked spaces constantly communicating their various properties states and attributes often through decentralised and devolved systems Crucial system feedback is supplied by a wide range of users and occupants often either by miniature electronic devices or mobile phones crowdsourcing like crowd-funding large volumes of small data feeds to provide accurate and expansive real-time information Personalisation replaces standardisation as spaces 'intelligently' recognise and respond to individual occupants Representations of spaces become as vital after construction as they are before real-time monitoring feedback and ambient display become integral elements to the ongoing life of spaces and objects Maintenance and operations become extended inseparable phases of the construction process a building is never \"complete\" in open-source architecture's world of growth and change If tomorrow s buildings and cities will be like \"computers to live in\" see also smart city open-source architecture provides an open collaborative framework for writing their operating software in real world conditions reflecting the principles of the

A value network is a business analysis perspective that describes social and technical resources within and between businesses The nodes in a value network represent people or roles The nodes are

complementary open innovation networks and suppliers Internal edit Internal value networks focus on key activities processes and relationships that cut across internal boundaries such as order fulfillment innovation lead processing or customer support Value is created through exchange and the relationships between roles Value networks operate in public agencies civil society in the enterprise institutional settings and all forms of organization Value networks advance innovation wealth social good and environmental well-being Clayton Christensen edit Christensen defines value network as \"The collection of upstream suppliers downstream channels to market and ancillary providers that support a common business model within an industry When would-be disruptors enter into existing value networks they must adapt their business models to conform to the value network and therefore fail at disruption because they become co-opted \"   Fjeldstad and Stabells edit Fjeldstad and Stabell   presents a framework for \"value configurations\" in which a \"value Network\" is one of three alternatives ways in which an organisation generates value the others being the value shop and value Chain F&S's value networks consists of these components A set of customers Some service the customers all use and enables interaction between the customers Some organization that provides the service A set of contracts that enables access to the service An obvious example of a value network is the network formed by phone users The phone company provides a service users enter a contract with the phone company and immediately has access to all the value network of other customers of the phone company Another less obvious example is a car insurance company The company provides car insurance The customers gains access to the roads and can do their thing and interact in various ways while being exposed to limited risk The insurance policies represent the contracts the internal processes of the insurance company the service provisioning Unfortunately F&S and Christensen's concepts both address the same issue the conceptual understanding of how a company understands itself and its value creation process but they are not identical Christensen's value networks address the relation between a company and its suppliers and the requirements posed by the customers and how these interact when defining what represents value in the product that is produced Fjeldstad & Stabell's value networks is a configuration which emphasize that the value being created is between customers when they interact facilitated by the value networks This represents a very different perspective from Christensen's but confusingly also one that is applicable in many of the same situations as Christensen's Normann and Ramirez' value constellations edit Normann and Ramirez argued   as early as   that in today's environment strategy is no longer a matter of positioning a fixed set of activities along a value chain According to them the focus today should be on the value creating system itself Where all stakeholders co-produce value Successful companies conceive of strategy as systematic social innovation With this article they laid a foundation for the Value Network to emerge as a mental model Verna Allee edit Verna Allee defines value networks   as any web of relationships that generates both tangible and intangible value through complex dynamic exchanges between two or more individuals groups or organizations Any organization or group of organizations engaged in both tangible and intangible exchanges can be viewed as a value network whether private industry government or public sector Allee developed Value network analysis a whole systems mapping and analysis approach to understanding tangible and intangible value creation among participants in an enterprise system Revealing the hidden network patterns behind business processes can provide predictive intelligence for when workflow performance is at risk She believes value network analysis provides a standard way to define map and analyse the participants transactions and tangible and intangible deliverables that together form a value network Allee says value network analysis can lead to profound shifts in perception of problem situations and mobilise collective action to implement change   Important terms and concepts edit Tangible value edit All exchanges of goods services or revenue including all transactions involving contracts invoices return receipt of orders request for proposals confirmations and payment are considered to be tangible value Products or services that generate revenue or are expected as part of a service are also included in the tangible value flow of goods services and revenue   In government agencies these would be mandated activities In civil society organizations these would be formal commitments to provide resources or services Intangible value edit Two primary subcategories are included in intangible value knowledge and benefits Intangible knowledge exchanges include strategic information planning knowledge process knowledge technical know-how collaborative design and policy development which support the product and service tangible value network Intangible benefits are also considered favors that can be offered from one person to another Examples include offering political or emotional support to someone Another example of intangible value is when a research organization asks someone to volunteer their time and expertise to a project in exchange for the intangible benefit of prestige by affiliation   All biological organisms including humans function in a self-organizing mode internally and externally That is the elements in our bodies down to individual cells and DNA molecules work together in order to sustain us However there is no central \"boss\" to control this dynamic activity Our relationships with other individuals also progress through the same circular free flowing process as we search for outcomes that are best for our well-being Under the right conditions these social exchanges can be extraordinarily altruistic Conversely they can also be quite self-centered and even violent It all depends on the context of the immediate environment and the people involved   A non-linear approach edit Often value networks are considered to consist of groups of companies working together to produce and transport a product to the customer Relationships among customers of a single company are examples of how value networks can be found in any organization Companies can link their customers together by direct methods like the telephone or indirect methods like combining customer's resources together The purpose of value networks is to create the most benefit for the people involved in the network   The intangible value of knowledge within these networks is just as important as a monetary value In order to succeed knowledge must be shared to create the best situations or opportunities Value networks are how ideas flow into the market and to the people that need to hear them Because value networks are instrumental in advancing business and institutional practices a value network analysis can be useful in a wide variety of business situations Some typical ones are listed below Relationship management edit Relationship management typically just focuses on managing information about customers suppliers and business partners A value network approach considers relationships as two-way value-creating interactions which focus on realizing value as well as providing value Business web and ecosystem development edit Resource deployment delivery market innovation knowledge sharing and time-to-market advantage are dependent on the quality coherence and vitality of the relevant value networks business webs and business ecosystems   Fast-track complex process redesign edit Product and service offerings are constantly changing and so are the processes to innovate design manufacture and deliver them Multiple inter-dependent and concurrent processes are too complex for traditional process mapping but can be analyzed very quickly with the value network method Reconfiguring the organization edit Mergers acquisitions downsizing expansion to new markets new product groups new partners new roles and functions anytime relationships change value interactions and flows change too   Supporting knowledge networks and communities of practice edit Understanding the transactional dynamics is vital for purposeful networks of all kinds including networks and communities focused on creating knowledge value A value network analysis helps communities of practice negotiate for resources and demonstrate their value to different groups within the organization Develop scorecards conduct ROI and cost/benefit analyses and drive decision making edit Because the value network approach addresses both financial and non-financial assets and exchanges it expands metrics and indexes beyond the lagging indicators of financial return and operational performance to also include leading indicators for strategic capability and system optimization   edit Creativity techniques Complexity science Value economics Value conversion Value network analysis"},

State of art   navigation search For other uses see State of the art disambiguation State of the art sometimes cutting edge refers to the highest level of general development as of a device technique or scientific field achieved at a particular time It also refers to such a level of development reached at any particular time as a result of the common methodologies employed at the time The term has been used since   and has become both a common term in advertising and marketing and a legally significant phrase with respect to both patent law and tort liability In advertising the phrase is often used to convey that a product is made with the best possible technology but it has been noted that \"the term 'state of the art' requires little proof on the part of advertisers\" as it is considered mere puffery   The use of the term in patent law by contrast \"does not connote even superiority let alone the superlative quality the ad writers would have us ascribe to the term\"   Contents   Origin and history   Legal importance     Patent law     Tort liability       References     Origin and history edit The origin of the concept of \"state of the art\" took place in the beginning of the twentieth century   The earliest use of the term \"state of the art\" documented by the Oxford English Dictionary dates back to   from an engineering manual by Henry Harrison Suplee 1856-post   an engineering graduate University of Pennsylvania   titled Gas Turbine progress in the design and construction of turbines operated by gases of combustion The relevant passage reads \"In the present state of the art this is all that can be done\" The term \"art\" refers to technics rather than performing or fine arts   Over time use of the term increased in all fields where this kind of art has a significant role   In this relation it has been quoted by the author that \" Although eighteenth century writers did not use the term there was indeed in existence a collection of scientific and engineering knowledge and expertise that can be identified as the state of the art for that time \"   Despite its actual meaning which does not convey technology that is ahead of the industry the phrase became so widely used in advertising that a   article described it as \"overused\" stating that \" i t has no punch left and actually sounds like a lie\"   A   essay listed it among \"the same old tired clich s \" that should be avoided in advertising   Legal importance edit Patent law edit   Prior art In the context of European and Australian patent law the term \"state of the art\" is a concept used in the process of assessing and asserting novelty and inventive step   and is a synonym of the expression \" prior art \"   In the European Patent Convention EPC \" the state of the art shall be held to comprise everything made available to the public by means of a written or oral description by use or in any other way before the date of filing of the European patent application\" according to Article     EPC Due account should be taken of Article     EPC as well but merely for the examination of novelty The expression \"background art\" is also used in certain legal provisions such as Rule     b and c EPC previously Rule     b and c EPC   and has the same meaning   Tort liability edit The state of the art is important in the law of tort liability specifically in the areas of negligence and products liability With respect to negligence \"an engineer may defend against a claim of negligence by contending that he met the standards of his profession and the state of the art\"   With respect to products liability manufacturers generally have strict liability for any injury caused by defects in their products However in some jurisdictions a manufacturer may raise as a legal defense the assertion that their product represents the \"state of the art\" and that the manufacturer therefore could not have made the product any safer in light of the knowledge available at the time   For example \" u nder German law the producer can also raise the state of the art defense general tort law does not hold him liable if he could not know or discover the defect for lack of fault and the Product Liability Statute expressly provides for this defense\"   This defense is available throughout the European Community under the Product Liability Directive art   e Pursuant to this article The state-of-the-art defense allows a defendant to be absolved of liability if he can prove that the state of technical and scientific knowledge at the time when he put the product into circulation was not such as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered The Directive allows Member States to eliminate the state- of-the-art defense but only Luxembourg which has little manufacturing industry has done so   In the United States in those states that follow the common law the state of an industry is \"merely evidence of due care rather than a controlling factor\"   but a number of states have State-of-the-Art statutes that \"make a manufacturer's compliance with technological feasibility an absolute defense to a products liability suit\"   Because the state of the art is constantly advancing the ability of manufacturers to claim that their products are \"state-of-the-art\" tracks their potential liability when these products are defective As an industry journal explained in the 1980s Remote control rear view mirrors disc brakes automatic slack adjusters for drum brakes and sealed lighting systems are just a few examples of products that have advanced the state of the art When one of these gains a degree of industry acceptance it begins to bridge a legal gap between what is state of the art from a design standpoint and what is state of the art from a usage standpoint This could place a carrier in a vulnerable position in the not too distant future     edit Bleeding edge Cutting edge disambiguation High end Innovation"},

material may be challenged and removed August   Learn how and when to remove this template message The typical life-cycle of a manufacturing process or production system from the stages of its initial conception to its culmination as either a technique or procedure of common practice or to its demise The Y-axis of the diagram shows the business gain to the proprietor of the technology while the X-axis traces its lifetime The technology life-cycle TLC describes the commercial gain of a product through the expense of research and development phase and the financial return during its \"vital life\" Some technologies such as steel paper or cement manufacturing have a long lifespan with minor variations in technology incorporated with time while in other cases such as electronic or pharmaceutical products the lifespan may be quite short   The TLC associated with a product or technological service is different from product life-cycle PLC dealt with in product life-cycle management The latter is concerned with the life of a product in the marketplace with respect to timing of introduction marketing measures and business costs The technology underlying the product for example that of a uniquely flavoured tea may be quite marginal but the process of creating and managing its life as a branded product will be very different The technology life cycle is concerned with the time and cost of developing the technology the timeline of recovering cost and modes of making the technology yield a profit proportionate to the costs and risks involved The TLC may further be protected during its cycle with patents and trademarks seeking to lengthen the cycle and to maximize the profit from it The product of the technology may be a commodity such as polyethylene plastic or a sophisticated product like the integrated circuits used in a smartphone The development of a competitive product or process can have a major effect on the lifespan of the technology making it shorter Equally the loss of intellectual property rights through litigation or loss of its secret elements if any through leakages also work to reduce a technology's lifespan Thus it is apparent that the management of the TLC is an important aspect of technology development Most new technologies follow a similar technology maturity lifecycle describing the technological maturity of a product This is not similar to a product life cycle but applies to an entire technology or a generation of a technology Technology adoption is the most common phenomenon driving the evolution of industries along the industry lifecycle After expanding new uses of resources they end with exhausting the efficiency of those processes producing gains that are first easier and larger over time then exhaustingly more difficult as the technology matures Contents   The four phases of the technology life-cycle     S-curve   Technology perception dynamics   Licensing options     Licensing in the R&D phase     Licensing in the ascent phase     Licensing in the maturity phase     Licensing in the decline phase   Technology development cycle       References The four phases of the technology life-cycle edit The TLC may be seen as composed of four phases The research and development R&D phase sometimes called the \"bleeding edge\" when incomes from inputs are negative and where the prospects of failure are high The ascent phase when out-of-pocket costs have been recovered and the technology begins to gather strength by going beyond some Point A on the TLC sometimes called the \"leading edge\" The maturity phase when gain is high and stable the region going into saturation marked by M and The decline or decay phase after a Point D of reducing fortunes and utility of the technology S-curve edit The shape of the technology lifecycle is often referred to as S-curve   Technology perception dynamics edit There is usually technology hype at the introduction of any new technology but only after some time has passed can it be judged as mere hype or justified true acclaim Because of the logistic curve nature of technology adoption it is difficult to see in the early stages whether the hype is excessive The two errors commonly committed in the early stages of a technology's development are citation needed fitting an exponential curve to the first part of the growth curve and assuming eternal exponential growth fitting a linear curve to the first part of the growth curve and assuming that take-up of the new technology is disappointing Rogers' bell curve Similarly in the later stages the opposite mistakes can be made relating to the possibilities of technology maturity and market saturation The technology adoption life cycle typically occurs in an S curve as modelled in diffusion of innovations theory This is because customers respond to new products in different ways Diffusion of innovations theory pioneered by Everett Rogers posits that people have different levels of readiness for adopting new innovations and that the characteristics of a product affect overall adoption Rogers classified individuals into five groups innovators early adopters early majority late majority and laggards In terms of the S curve innovators occupy   5% early adopters   5% early majority 34% late majority 34% and laggards 16% The four stages of technology life cycle are as follows   Innovation stage This stage represents the birth of a new product material of process resulting from R&D activities In R&D laboratories new ideas are generated depending on gaining needs and knowledge factors Depending on the resource allocation and also the change element the time taken in the innovation stage as well as in the subsequent stages varies widely Syndication stage This stage represents the demonstration and commercialisation of a new technology such as product material or process with potential for immediate utilisation Many innovations are put on hold in R&D laboratories Only a very small percentage of these are commercialised Commercialisation of research outcomes depends on technical as well non-technical mostly economic factors Diffusion stage This represents the market penetration of a new technology through acceptance of the innovation by potential users of the technology But supply and demand side factors jointly influence the rate of diffusion Substitution stage This last stage represents the decline in the use and eventual extension of a technology due to replacement by another technology Many technical and non-technical factors influence the rate of substitution The time taken in the substitution stage depends on the market dynamics Licensing options edit Large corporations develop technology for their own benefit and not with the objective of licensing The tendency to license out technology only appears when there is a threat to the life of the TLC business gain as discussed later   Licensing in the R&D phase edit There are always smaller firms SMEs who are inadequately situated to finance the development of innovative R&D in the post-research and early technology phases By sharing incipient technology under certain conditions substantial risk financing can come from third parties This is a form of quasi-licensing which takes different formats Even large corporates may not wish to bear all costs of development in areas of significant and high risk e g aircraft development and may seek means of spreading it to the stage that proof-of-concept is obtained In the case of small and medium firms entities such as venture capitalists or business angels can enter the scene and help to materialize technologies Venture capitalists accept both the costs and uncertainties of R&D and that of market acceptance in reward for high returns when the technology proves itself Apart from finance they may provide networking management and marketing support Venture capital connotes financial as well as human capital Larger firms may opt for Joint R&D or work in a consortium for the early phase of development Such vehicles are called strategic alliances strategic partnerships With both venture capital funding and strategic research alliances when business gains begin to neutralize development costs the TLC crosses the X-axis the ownership of the technology starts to undergo change In the case of smaller firms venture capitalists help clients enter the stock market for obtaining substantially larger funds for development maturation of technology product promotion and to meet marketing costs A major route is through initial public offering IPO which invites risk funding by the public for potential high gain At the same time the IPOs enable venture capitalists to attempt to recover expenditures already incurred by them through part sale of the stock pre-allotted to them subsequent to the listing of the stock on the stock exchange When the IPO is fully subscribed the assisted enterprise becomes a corporation and can more easily obtain bank loans etc if needed Strategic alliance partners allied on research pursue separate paths of development with the incipient technology of common origin but pool their accomplishments through instruments such as 'cross-licensing' Generally contractual provisions among the members of the consortium allow a member to exercise the option of independent pursuit after joint consultation in which case the optee owns all subsequent development Licensing in the ascent phase edit The ascent stage of the technology usually refers to some point above Point A in the TLC diagram but actually it commences when the R&D portion of the TLC curve inflects only that the cashflow is negative and unremunerative to Point A The ascent is the strongest phase of the TLC because it is here that the technology is superior to alternatives and can command premium profit or gain The slope and duration of the ascent depends on competing technologies entering the domain although they may not be as successful in that period Strongly patented technology extends the duration period The TLC begins to flatten out the region shown as M when equivalent or challenging technologies come into the competitive space and begin to eat away marketshare Till this stage is reached the technology-owning firm would tend to exclusively enjoy its profitability preferring not to license it If an overseas opportunity does present itself the firm would prefer to set up a controlled subsidiary rather than license a third party Licensing in the maturity phase edit The maturity phase of the technology is a period of stable and remunerative income but its competitive viability can persist over the larger timeframe marked by its 'vital life' However there may be a tendency to license out the technology to third parties during this stage to lower risk of decline in profitability or competitivity and to expand financial opportunity The exercise of this option is generally inferior to seeking participatory exploitation in other words engagement in joint venture typically in regions where the technology would be in the ascent phase as say a developing country In addition to providing financial opportunity it allows the technology-owner a degree of control over its use Gain flows from the two streams of investment-based and royalty incomes Further the vital life of the technology is enhanced in such strategy Licensing in the decline phase edit After reaching a point such as D in the above diagram the earnings from the technology begin to decline rather rapidly To prolong the life cycle owners of technology might try to license it out at some point L when it can still be attractive to firms in other markets This then traces the lengthening path LL' Further since the decline is the result of competing rising technologies in this space licenses may be attracted to the general lower cost of the older technology than what prevailed during its vital life Licenses obtained in this phase are 'straight licenses' They are free of direct control from the owner of the technology as would otherwise apply say in the case of a joint-venture Further there may be fewer restrictions placed on the licensee in the employment of the technology The utility viability and thus the cost of straight-licenses depends on the estimated 'balance life' of the technology For instance should the key patent on the technology have expired or would expire in a short while the residual viability of the technology may be limited although balance life may be governed by other criteria such as knowhow which could have a longer life if properly protected It is important to note that the license has no way of knowing the stage at which the prime and competing technologies are on their TLCs It would of course be evident to competing licensor firms and to the originator from the growth saturation or decline of the profitability of their operations The license may however be able to approximate the stage by vigorously negotiating with the licensor and competitors to determine costs and licensing terms A lower cost or easier terms may imply a declining technology In any case access to technology in the decline phase is a large risk that the licensee accepts In a joint-venture this risk is substantially reduced by licensor sharing it Sometimes financial guarantees from the licensor may work to reduce such risk and can be negotiated There are instances when even though the technology declines to becoming a technique it may still contain important knowledge or experience which the licensee firm cannot learn of without help from the originator This is often the form that technical service and technical assistance contracts take encountered often in developing country contracts Alternatively consulting agencies may fill this role Technology development cycle edit According to the Encyclopedia of Earth \"In the simplest formulation innovation can be thought of as being composed of research development demonstration and deployment \"   Technology development cycle describes the process of a new technology through the

considers an entire work/activity system including teams organizations etc beyond just one actor or user It accounts for environment history of the person culture role of the artifact motivations and complexity of real life activity One of the strengths of AT is that it bridges the gap between the individual subject and the social reality it studies both through the mediating activity The unit of analysis in AT is the concept of object-oriented collective and culturally mediated human activity or activity system Critical approaches edit Critical theory goes beyond a descriptive account of how things are to examine why they have come to be that way and how they might otherwise be Critical theory asks whose interests are being served by the status quo and assesses the potential of future alternatives to better serve social justice According to Geuss's definition \"a critical theory then is a reflective theory which gives agents a kind of knowledge inherently productive of enlightenment and emancipation'   Marcuse argued that whilst matters of technology design are often presented as neutral technical choices in fact they manifest political or moral values Critical theory is a form of archaeology that attempt to get beneath common-sense understandings in order to reveal the power relationships and interests determining particular technological configuration and use Perhaps the most developed contemporary critical theory of technology is contained in the works of Andrew Feenberg including 'Transforming Technology'   Values in Design - asks how do we ensure a place for values alongside technical standards such as speed efficiency and reliability as criteria by which we judge the quality and acceptability of information systems and new media How do values such as privacy autonomy democracy and social justice become integral to conception design and development not merely retrofitted after completion? Key thinkers include Helen Nissenbaum   Other stances edit Additionally many authors have posed technology so as to critique and or emphasize aspects of technology as addressed by the mainline theories For example Steve Woolgar   considers technology as text in order to critique the sociology of scientific knowledge as applied to technology and to distinguish between three responses to that notion the instrumental response interpretive flexibility the interpretivist response environmental/organizational influences the reflexive response a double hermeneutic Pfaffenberger   treats technology as drama to argue that a recursive structuring of technological artifacts and their social structure discursively regulate the technological construction of political power A technological drama is a discourse of technological \"statements\" and \"counterstatements\" within the processes of technological regularization adjustment and reconstitution An important philosophical approach to technology has been taken by Bernard Stiegler whose work has been influenced by other philosophers and historians of technology including Gilbert Simondon and Andr Leroi-Gourhan In the Schumpeterian and Neo-Schumpeterian theories technologies are critical factors of economic growth Carlota Perez Group theories edit There are also a number of technology related theories that address how media technology affects group processes Broadly these theories are concerned with the social effects of communication media Some e g media richness are concerned with questions of media choice i e when to use what medium effectively Other theories social presence SIDE media naturalness are concerned with the consequences of those media choices i e what are the social effects of using particular communication media Social presence theory Short et al   is a seminal theory of the social effects of communication technology Its main concern is with telephony and telephone conferencing the research was sponsored by the British Post Office now British Telecom It argues that the social impact of a communication medium depend on the social presence it allows communicators to have Social presence is defined as a property of the medium itself the degree of acoustic visual and physical contact that it allows The theory assumes that more contact will increase the key components of \"presence\" greater intimacy immediacy warmth and inter-personal rapport As a consequence of social presence social influence is expected to increase In the case of communication technology the assumption is that more text-based forms of interaction e-mail instant messaging are less social and therefore less conducive to social influence Media richness theory Daft & Lengel   shares some characteristics with social presence theory It posits that the amount of information communicated differs with respect to a medium's richness The theory assumes that resolving ambiguity and reducing uncertainty are the main goals of communication Because communication media differ in the rate of understanding they can achieve in a specific time with \"rich\" media carrying more information they are not all capable of resolving uncertainty and ambiguity well The more restricted the medium's capacity the less uncertainty and equivocality it is able to manage It follows that the richness of the media should be matched to the task so as to prevent over simplification or complication Media naturalness theory Kock     builds on human evolution ideas and has been proposed as an alternative to media richness theory Media naturalness theory argues that since our Stone Age hominid ancestors have communicated primarily face-to-face evolutionary pressures have led to the development of a brain that is consequently designed for that form of communication Other forms of communication are too recent and unlikely to have posed evolutionary pressures that could have shaped our brain in their direction Using communication media that suppress key elements found in face-to-face communication as many electronic communication media do thus ends up posing cognitive obstacles to communication This is particularly the case in the context of complex tasks e g business process redesign new product development online learning because such tasks seem to require more intense communication over extended periods of time than simple tasks Media synchronicity theory MST Dennis & Valacich   redirects richness theory towards the synchronicity of the communication The social identity model of deindividuation effects SIDE Postmes Spears and Lea   Reicher Spears and Postmes   Spears & Lea   was developed as a response to the idea that anonymity and reduced presence made communication technology socially impoverished or \"deindividuated\" It provided an alternative explanation for these \" deindividuation effects\" based on theories of social identity e g Turner et al   The SIDE model distinguishes cognitive and strategic effects of a communication technology Cognitive effects occur when communication technologies make \"salient\" particular aspects of personal or social identity For example certain technologies such as email may disguise characteristics of the sender that individually differentiate them i e that convey aspects of their personal identity and as a result more attention may be given to their social identity The strategic effects are due to the possibilities afforded by communication technology to selectively communicate or enact particular aspects of identity and disguise others SIDE therefore sees the social and the technological as mutually determining and the behavior associated with particular communication forms as the product or interaction of the two Time interaction and performance TIP McGrath   theory describes work groups as time-based multi-modal and multi-functional social systems Groups interact in one of the modes of inception problem solving conflict resolution and execution The three functions of a group are production towards a goal support affective and well-being norms and roles Analytic theories edit Finally there are theories of technology which are not defined or claimed by a proponent but are used by authors in describing existing literature in contrast to their own or as a review of the field For example Markus and Robey   propose a general technology theory consisting of the causal structures of agency technological organizational imperative emergent its structure variance process and the level micro macro of analysis Orlikowski   notes that previous conceptualizations of technology typically differ over scope is technology more than hardware? and role is it an external objective force the interpreted human action or an impact moderated by humans? and identifies three models Technological imperative focuses on organizational characteristics which can be measured and permits some level of contingency Strategic choice focuses on how technology is influenced by the context and strategies of decision-makers and users Technology as a trigger of structural change views technology as a social object DeSanctis and Poole   similarly write of three views of technology's effects Decision-making the view of engineers associated with positivist rational systems rationalization and deterministic approaches Institutional school technology is an opportunity for change focuses on social evolution social construction of meaning interaction and historical processes interpretive flexibility and an interplay between technology and power An integrated perspective social technology soft-line determinism with joint social and technological optimization structural symbolic interaction theory Bimber   addresses the determinacy of technology effects by distinguishing between the Normative an autonomous approach where technology is an important influence on history only where societies attached cultural and political meaning to it e g the industrialization of society Nomological a naturalistic approach wherein an inevitable technological order arises based on laws of nature e g steam mill had to follow the hand mill Unintended consequences a fuzzy approach that is demonstrative that technology is contingent e g a car is faster than a horse but unbeknownst to its original creators become a significant source of pollution"},

and certifications are voluntary usually third party-assessed norms and standards relating to environmental social ethical and food safety issues adopted by companies to demonstrate the performance of their organizations or products in specific areas There are perhaps up to   such standards citation needed and the pace of introduction has increased in the last decade citation needed The trend started in the late 1980s and 90s with the introduction of Ecolabels and standards for Organic food and other products In recent years numerous standards have been established and adopted in the food industry in particular citation needed Most of them refer to the triple bottom line of environmental quality social equity and economic prosperity   A standard is normally developed by a broad range of stakeholders and experts in a particular sector and includes a set of practices or criteria for how a crop should be sustainable grown or a resource should be ethically harvested This might cover for instance responsible fishing practices that don't endanger marine biodiversity or respect for human rights and the payment of fair wages on a coffee or tea plantation Normally sustainability standards are accompanied by a verification process - often referred to as \"certification\" - to evaluate that an enterprise complies with a standard as well as a traceability process for certified products to be sold along the supply chain often resulting in a consumer-facing label Certification programmes also focus on capacity building and working with partners and other organisations to support smallholders or disadvantaged producers to make the social and environmental improvements needed to meet the standard The basic premise of sustainability standards is twofold Firstly they emerged in areas where national and global legislation was weak but where the consumer and NGO movements around the globe demanded action For example campaigns by Global Exchange   and other NGOs against the purchase of goods from sweatshop factories by the likes of Nike Inc Levi Strauss & Co and other leading brands led to the emergence of social welfare standards like the SA8000 and others Secondly leading brands selling to both consumers and to the B2B supply chain may wish to demonstrate the environmental or organic merits of their products which has led to the emergence of hundreds of ecolabels citation needed organic and other standards A leading example of a consumer standard is the Fairtrade movement administered by FLO International and exhibiting huge sales growth around the world for ethically sourced produce   An example of a B2B standard which has grown tremendously in the last few years is the Forest Stewardship Council s standard FSC for forest products made from sustainable harvested trees However the line between consumer and B2B sustainability standards is becoming blurred with leading trade buyers increasingly demanding Fairtrade certification for example and consumers increasingly recognizing the FSC mark In recent years the business-to-business focus of sustainability standards has risen as it has become clear that consumer demand alone cannot drive the transformation of major sectors and industries citation needed In commodities such as palm oil soy farmed seafood and sugar certification initiatives are targeting the mainstream adoption of better practices and precompetitive industry collaboration Major brands and retailers are also starting to make commitments to certification in their whole supply chain or product offering rather than a single product line or ingredient citation needed With the growth of standards and certification as the major tool for global production and trade to become more sustainable and for the private sector to demonstrate sustainability leadership it is essential that there are ways to assess the legitimacy and performance of different initiatives Company and government buyers as well as NGOs and civil society groups committed to sustainable production need clarity on which standards and ecolabels are delivering real social environmental and economic results The ISEAL Alliance has emerged as the authority on good practice for sustainability standards and its Codes of Good Practice represent the most widely recognised guidance on how standards should be set up and implemented in order to be effective citation needed By complying with these Codes and working with other certification initiatives ISEAL members demonstrate their credibility and work towards improving their positive impacts Attempts to address the problems caused by a multiplicity of certification initiatives led to the launch of The State of Sustainability Initiatives SSI project facilitated by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD and the International Institute for Sustainable Development IISD under the auspices of the Sustainable Commodity Initiative SCI citation needed

social movements in particular countries such as Rainforest Alliance in the United States and Fairtrade in the Netherlands citation needed Other standards were initiated by individual companies such as Utz Certified Ahold Starbucks C A F E Starbucks and Nespresso AAA Nespresso Some standards were launched by coalitions of private firms development agencies NGOs and other stakeholders For example the Common Code for the Coffee Community 4C was initiated by an alliance of large American coffee roasters including Kraft Foods Sara Lee and Nestle assisted by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development GIZ One important facilitator for the development of most global standards were series of local development projects involving NGOs coffee roasters and producers in different developing countries For example the Fairtrade standard was developed based on pilot projects with Mexican farmers 4C builds on development projects in Peru Colombia and Vietnam involving GIZ major coffee roasters and local producers   The most widely established and adopted standards are in agriculture with 40% of global coffee production certified to one of the main schemes and approximately 15-20% of cocoa and tea production being compliant with major international standards Forestry and wild seafood are also sectors in which standards have been influential with certified production pushing past 10% of the global share Cotton palm oil soy biofuels and farmed seafood are some of the commodities in which certification is growing the fastest due in part to major roundtables that have been set up to bring the whole industry together More recently standards have started to emerge for mining and the extraction of metals - including gold silver aluminium and oil and gas - as well as for cattle electronics plastics and tourism Evidence suggests that Corporate Social Responsibility CSR adopted willingly by firms will be much more effective than government regulated CSR so global standards by private companies show promise for effective social impact   The creation of the ISEAL Alliance in   was the first collaborative effort amongst a group of

May   Learn how and when to remove this template message Numerous sustainability standards have been developed in recent years to address issues of environmental quality social equity and economic prosperity of global production and trade practices Despite similarities in major goals and certification procedures there are some significant differences in terms of their historical development target groups of adopters geographical diffusion and emphasis on environmental social or economic issues   One of the major differences to be aware of is based on the level of strictness of the standard Some standards set the bar high for a sector promoting the strongest social and environmental practices and working with the top performers to constantly push up sustainability expectations citation needed Other standards are more focused on the elimination of the worst practices and operate at more of an entry-level to get a large proportion of an industry working incrementally towards better practices Often times there are strategies between standards to move producers along this performance ladder of sustainability citation needed Another important distinction is that some standards can be applied internationally usually with mechanisms to ensure local relevance and appropriateness whereas other standards are developed entirely with a regional or national focus citation needed Additional differences between standards might relate to the certification process and whether it is conducted by a first second or third party the traceability system in place and whether it allows for the segregation or mixing of certified and non-certified materials and the types of sustainability claims that are made on products Fairtrade edit The Fairtrade label was developed in the late 1980s by a Dutch development agency in collaboration with Mexican farmers citation needed The initiative performs development work and promotes its political vision of an alternative economy seeing its main objective in empowering small producers and providing these with access to and improving their position on global markets citation needed The most distinguishing feature of the Fairtrade label is the guarantee of a minimum price and a social premium that goes to the cooperative and not to the producers directly Recently citation needed Fairtrade also adopted environmental

innovation that improves a product in an existing market in ways that customers are expecting e g fuel injection for gasoline engines which displaced carburetors Revolutionary discontinuous radical An innovation that is unexpected but nevertheless does not affect existing markets e g the first automobiles in the late 19th century which were expensive luxury items and as such very few were sold Disruptive An innovation that creates a new market by providing a different set of values which ultimately and unexpectedly overtakes an existing market e g the lower-priced affordable Ford Model T which displaced horse-drawn carriages Disruptive innovation is a term in the field of business administration which refers to an innovation that creates a new market and value network and eventually disrupts an existing market and value network displacing established market leading firms products and alliances   The term was defined and first analyzed by the American scholar Clayton M Christensen and his collaborators beginning in     and has been called the most influential business idea of the early 21st century   Not all innovations are disruptive even if they are revolutionary For example the first automobiles in the late 19th century were not a disruptive innovation because early automobiles were expensive luxury items that did not disrupt the market for horse-drawn vehicles The market for transportation essentially remained intact until the debut of the lower-priced Ford Model T in     The mass-produced automobile was a disruptive innovation because it changed the transportation market whereas the first thirty years of automobiles did not Disruptive innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and entrepreneurs rather than existing market-leading companies The business environment of market leaders does not allow them to pursue disruptive innovations when they first arise because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from sustaining innovations which are needed to compete against current competition   A disruptive process can take longer to develop than by the conventional approach and the risk associated to it is higher than the other more incremental or evolutionary forms of innovations but once it is deployed in the market it achieves a much faster penetration and higher degree of impact on the established markets   Beyond business and economics disruptive innovations can also be considered to disrupt complex systems including economic and business-related aspects   Contents

References   Further reading     History and usage of the term edit The term disruptive technologies was coined by Clayton M Christensen and introduced in his   article Disruptive Technologies Catching the Wave   which he cowrote with Joseph Bower The article is aimed at management executives who make the funding or purchasing decisions in companies rather than the research community He describes the term further in his book The Innovator's Dilemma   Innovator's Dilemma explored the cases of the disk drive industry which with its rapid generational change is to the study of business what fruit flies are to the study of genetics as Christensen was advised in the 1990s   and the excavating equipment industry where hydraulic actuation slowly displaced cable-actuated movement In his sequel with Michael E Raynor The Innovator's Solution   Christensen replaced the term disruptive technology with disruptive innovation because he recognized that few technologies are intrinsically disruptive or sustaining in character rather it is the business model that the technology enables that creates the disruptive impact However Christensen's evolution from a technological focus to a business-modelling focus is central to understanding the evolution of business at the market or industry level Christensen and Mark W Johnson who cofounded the management consulting firm Innosight described the dynamics of \"business model innovation\" in the   Harvard Business Review article \"Reinventing Your Business Model\"   The concept of disruptive technology continues a long tradition of identifying radical technical change in the study of innovation by economists and the development of tools for its management at a firm or policy level The term disruptive innovation is misleading when it is used to refer to a product or service at one fixed point rather than to the evolution of that product or service over time In the late 1990s the automotive sector began to embrace a perspective of \"constructive disruptive technology\" by working with the consultant David E O'Ryan whereby the use of current off-the-shelf technology was integrated with newer innovation to create what he called \"an unfair advantage\" The process or technology change as a whole had to be \"constructive\" in improving the current method of manufacturing yet disruptively impact the whole of the business case model resulting in a significant reduction of waste energy materials labor or legacy costs to the user In keeping with the insight that what matters economically is the business model not the technological sophistication itself Christensen's theory explains why many disruptive innovations are not \"advanced technologies\" which a default hypothesis would lead one to expect Rather they are often novel combinations of existing off-the-shelf components applied cleverly to a small fledgling value network Online news site TechRepublic suggests to end using the term and similar related terms being that it is overused jargon as of     Theory edit The current theoretical understanding of disruptive innovation is different from what might be expected by default an idea that Clayton M Christensen called the \"technology mudslide hypothesis\" This is the simplistic idea that an established firm fails because it doesn't \"keep up technologically\" with other firms In this hypothesis firms are like climbers scrambling upward on crumbling footing where it takes constant upward-climbing effort just to stay still and any break from the effort such as complacency born of profitability causes a rapid downhill slide Christensen and colleagues have shown that this simplistic hypothesis is wrong it doesn't model reality What they have shown is that good firms are usually aware of the innovations but their business environment does not allow them to pursue them when they first arise because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from that of sustaining innovations which are needed to compete against current competition In Christensen's terms a firm's existing value networks place insufficient value on the disruptive innovation to allow its pursuit by that firm Meanwhile start-up firms inhabit different value networks at least until the day that their disruptive innovation is able to invade the older value network At that time the established firm in that network can at best only fend off the market share attack with a me-too entry for which survival not thriving is the only reward   Christensen defines a disruptive innovation as a product or service designed for a new set of customers \"Generally disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward consisting of off-the-shelf components put together in a product architecture that was often simpler than prior approaches They offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so could rarely be initially employed there They offered a different package of attributes valued only in emerging markets remote from and unimportant to the mainstream \"   Christensen argues that disruptive innovations can hurt successful well-managed companies that are responsive to their customers and have excellent research and development These companies tend to ignore the markets most susceptible to disruptive innovations because the markets have very tight profit margins and are too small to provide a good growth rate to an established sizable firm   Thus disruptive technology provides an example of an instance when the common business-world advice to \" focus on the customer \" or \"stay close to the customer\" or \"listen to the customer\" can be strategically counterproductive While Christensen argued that disruptive innovations can hurt successful well-managed companies O'Ryan countered that \"constructive\" integration of existing new and forward-thinking innovation could improve the economic benefits of these same well-managed companies once decision-making management understood the systemic benefits as a whole How low-end disruption occurs over time clarification needed Christensen distinguishes between \"low-end disruption\" which targets customers who do not need the full performance valued by customers at the high end of the market and \"new-market disruption\" which targets customers who have needs that were previously unserved by existing incumbents   \"Low-end disruption\" occurs when the rate at which products improve exceeds the rate at which customers can adopt the new performance Therefore at some point the performance of the product overshoots the needs of certain customer segments At this point a disruptive technology may enter the market and provide a product that has lower performance than the incumbent but that exceeds the requirements of certain segments thereby gaining a foothold in the market In low-end disruption the disruptor is focused initially on serving the least profitable customer who is happy with a good enough product This type of customer is not willing to pay premium for enhancements in product functionality Once the disruptor has gained a foothold in this customer segment it seeks to improve its profit margin To get higher profit margins the disruptor needs to enter the segment where the customer is willing to pay a little more for higher quality To ensure this quality in its product the disruptor needs to innovate The incumbent will not do much to retain its share in a not-so-profitable segment and will move up-market and focus on its more attractive customers After a number of such encounters the incumbent is squeezed into smaller markets than it was previously serving And then finally the disruptive technology meets the demands of the most profitable segment and drives the established company out of the market \"New market disruption\" occurs when a product fits a new or emerging market segment that is not being served by existing incumbents in the industry The extrapolation of the theory to all aspects of life has been challenged     as has the methodology of relying on selected case studies as the principal form of evidence   Jill Lepore points out that some companies identified by the theory as victims of disruption a decade or more ago rather than being defunct remain dominant in their industries today including Seagate Technology U S Steel and Bucyrus   Lepore questions whether the theory has been oversold and misapplied as if it were able to explain everything in every sphere of life including not just business but education and public institutions   Disruptive technology edit In   Milan Zeleny described high technology as disruptive technology and raised the question of what is being disrupted The answer according to Zeleny is the support network of high technology   For example introducing electric cars disrupts the support network for gasoline cars network of gas and service stations Such disruption is fully expected and therefore effectively resisted by support net owners In the long run high disruptive technology bypasses upgrades or replaces the outdated support network Questioning the concept of a disruptive technology Haxell   questions how such technologies get named and framed pointing out that this is a positioned and retrospective act     Technology being a form of social relationship citation needed always evolves No technology remains fixed Technology starts develops persists mutates stagnates and declines just like living organisms   The evolutionary life cycle occurs in the use and development of any technology A new high-technology core emerges and challenges existing technology support nets TSNs which are thus forced to coevolve with it New versions of the core are designed and fitted into an increasingly appropriate TSN with smaller and smaller high-technology effects High technology becomes regular technology with more efficient versions fitting the same support net Finally even the efficiency gains diminish emphasis shifts to product tertiary attributes appearance style and technology becomes TSN-preserving appropriate technology This technological equilibrium state becomes established and fixated resisting being interrupted by a technological mutation then new high technology appears and the cycle is repeated Regarding this evolving process of technology Christensen said \"The technological changes that damage established companies are usually not radically new or difficult from a technological point of view They do however have two important characteristics First they typically present a different package of performance attributes ones that at least at the outset are not valued by existing customers Second the performance attributes that existing customers do value improve at such a rapid rate that the new technology can later invade those established markets \"   Joseph Bower   explained the process of how disruptive technology through its requisite support net dramatically transforms a certain industry \"When the technology that has the potential for revolutionizing an industry emerges established companies typically see it as unattractive it s not something their mainstream customers want and its projected profit margins aren t sufficient to cover big-company cost structure As a result the new technology tends to get ignored in favor of what s currently popular with the best customers But then another company steps in to bring the innovation to a new market Once the disruptive technology becomes established there smaller-scale innovation rapidly raise the technology s performance on attributes that mainstream customers value \"   The automobile was high technology with respect to the horse carriage however it evolved into technology and finally into appropriate technology with a stable unchanging TSN The main high-technology advance in the offing is some form of electric car whether the energy source is the sun hydrogen water air pressure or traditional charging outlet Electric cars preceded the gasoline automobile by many decades and are now returning to replace the traditional gasoline automobile The printing press was a development that changed the way that information was stored transmitted and replicated This allowed empowered authors but it also promoted censorship and information overload in writing technology Milan Zeleny described the above phenomenon   He also wrote that \"Implementing high technology is often resisted This resistance is well understood on the part of active participants in the requisite TSN The electric car will be resisted by gas-station operators in the same way automated teller machines ATMs were resisted by bank tellers and automobiles by horsewhip makers Technology does not qualitatively restructure the TSN and therefore will not be resisted and never has been resisted Middle management resists business process reengineering because BPR represents a direct assault on the support net coordinative hierarchy they thrive on Teamwork and multi-functionality is resisted by those whose TSN provides the comfort of narrow specialization and command-driven work \"   Social media could be considered a disruptive innovation within sports More specifically the way that news in sports circulates nowadays versus the pre-internet era where sports news was mainly on T V radio and newspapers Social media has created a new market for sports that was not around before in the sense that players and fans have instant access to information related to sports High-technology effects edit High technology is a technology core that changes the very architecture structure and organization of the components of the technology support net High technology therefore transforms the qualitative nature of the TSN's tasks and their relations as well as their requisite physical energy and information flows It also affects the skills required the roles played and the styles of management and coordination the organizational culture itself This kind of technology core is different from regular technology core which preserves the qualitative nature of flows and the structure of the support and only allows users to perform the same tasks in the same way but faster more reliably in larger quantities or more efficiently It is also different from appropriate technology core which preserves the TSN itself with the purpose of technology implementation and allows users to do the same thing in the same way at comparable levels of efficiency instead of improving the efficiency of performance   As for the difference between high technology and low technology Milan Zeleny once said \" The effects of high technology always breaks the direct comparability by changing the system itself therefore requiring new measures and new assessments of its productivity High technology cannot be compared and evaluated with the existing technology purely on the basis of cost net present value or return on investment Only within an unchanging and relatively stable TSN would such direct financial comparability be meaningful For example you can directly compare a manual typewriter with an electric typewriter but not a typewriter with a word processor Therein lies the management challenge of high technology \"   However not all modern technologies are high technologies They have to be used as such function as such and be embedded in their requisite TSNs They have to empower the individual because only through the individual can they empower knowledge Not all information technologies have integrative effects Some information systems are still designed to improve the traditional hierarchy of command and thus preserve and entrench the existing TSN The administrative model of management for instance further aggravates the division of task and labor further specializes knowledge separates management from workers and concentrates information and knowledge in centers As knowledge surpasses capital labor and raw materials as the dominant economic resource technologies are also starting to reflect this shift Technologies are rapidly shifting from centralized hierarchies to distributed networks Nowadays knowledge does not reside in a super-mind super-book or super-database but in a complex relational pattern of networks brought forth to coordinate human action Practical example of disruption edit In the practical world the popularization of personal computers illustrates how knowledge contributes to the ongoing technology innovation The original centralized concept one computer many persons is a knowledge-defying idea of the prehistory of computing and its inadequacies and failures have become clearly apparent The era of personal computing brought powerful computers \"on every desk\" one person one computer This short transitional period was necessary for getting used to the new computing environment but was inadequate from the vantage point of producing knowledge Adequate knowledge creation and management come mainly from networking and distributed computing one person many computers Each person's computer must form an access point to the entire computing landscape or ecology through the Internet of other computers databases and mainframes as well as production distribution and retailing facilities and the like For the first time technology empowers individuals rather than external hierarchies It transfers influence and power where it optimally belongs at the loci of the useful knowledge Even though hierarchies and bureaucracies do not innovate free and empowered individuals do knowledge innovation spontaneity and self-reliance are becoming increasingly valued and promoted   Examples edit This section needs additional citations for verification Please help

had unusually large changes in market share over the past fifty years According to Clayton M Christensen's research the cause of this instability was a repeating pattern of disruptive innovations   For example in   the old   inch drives used in mini computers were \"vastly superior\" to the new     inch drives used in desktop computers   However   inch drives were not affordable for the new desktop machines The simple     inch drive assembled from technologically inferior \"off-the-shelf\" components   was an \"innovation\" only in the sense that it was new However as this market grew

less power-consuming than a light bulb The first optical LEDs were weak and only useful as indicator lights Later models could be used for indoor lighting and now several cities are switching to LED street lights Incandescent light bulbs are being phased out in many countries LED displays and AMOLED are also becoming competitive with LCDs LCD LED displays CRT The first liquid crystal displays LCD were monochromatic and had low resolution They were used in watches and other handheld devices but during the early 2000s these and other planar technologies largely replaced the dominant cathode ray tube CRT technology for computer displays and television sets CRT sets were very heavy and the size and weight of the tube limited the maximum screen size to about   inches in contrast LCD and other flat-panel TVs are available in 40\" 50\" 60\" and even bigger sizes all of which weigh much less than a CRT set CRT technologies did improve in the late 1990s with advances like true-flat panels and digital controls however these updates were not enough to prevent CRTs from being displaced by flat-panel LCD and LED TVs Manufacturing Hydraulic excavators Cable -operated excavators Hydraulic excavators were clearly innovative at the time of introduction but they gained widespread use only decades after However cable-operated excavators are still used in some cases mainly for large

illegal peer-to-peer file sharing technologies and then by online retailers such as the iTunes Store and Amazon com This low end disruption eventually undermined the sales of physical high-cost recordings such as records tapes and CDs   Streaming video Video rental Video on demand software can run on many Internet-enabled devices Since licensing deals between film studios and streaming providers have become standard this has obviated the need for people to seek rentals at physically separate locations Netflix a dominant company in this market was cited as a significant threat to

ceased operation ten years later   Photography Digital photography Chemical photography Early digital cameras suffered from low picture quality and resolution and long shutter lag Quality and resolution are no longer major issues in the 2010s and shutter lag issues have been largely resolved The convenience of small memory cards and portable hard drives that hold hundreds or thousands of pictures as well as the lack of the need to develop these pictures also helped make digital cameras the market leader Digital cameras have a high power consumption but several lightweight battery packs can provide enough power for thousands of pictures Cameras for classic photography are stand-alone devices In the same manner high-resolution digital video recording has replaced film stock

stylize copy and facilitate document production Transportation Steamboats Sailing ships The first steamships were deployed on inland waters where sailing ships were less effective instead of on the higher profit margin seagoing routes Hence steamships originally only competed in traditional shipping lines' \"worst\" markets citation needed Automobiles Rail transport At the beginning of the 20th century rail including streetcars was the fastest and most cost-efficient means of land transportation for goods and passengers in industrialized countries The first cars buses and trucks were used for local transportation in suburban areas where they often replaced streetcars and industrial tracks As highways expanded medium- and later long-distance transports were relocated to road traffic and some railways closed down As rail traffic has a lower ton-kilometer cost but a higher investment and operating cost than road traffic rail is still preferred for large-scale bulk cargo such as minerals However traffic congestion provides a bound on the efficiency of car use and so rail is still used for urban passenger transport High speed rail Short distance flights In almost every market where high speed rail with journey times of two hours or less was introduced in competition with an air service the air service was either greatly reduced within a few years or ceased entirely Even in markets with longer rail travel times airlines have reduced the amount of flights on offer and passenger numbers have gone down Examples include the Barcelona-Madrid high speed railway the Cologne Frankfurt high speed railway where no direct flights are available as of   or the Paris-London connection after the opening of High Speed   For medium-distance trips like between Beijing & Shanghai the high speed rail and airlines often end up in extremely stiff competition Private jet Supersonic transport The Concorde aircraft has so far been the only supersonic airliner in extensive commercial traffic However it catered to a small customer segment which could later afford small private sub-sonic jets The loss of speed was compensated by flexibility and a more direct routing i e no need to go through a hub Supersonic flight is also banned above inhabited land due to sonic booms Concorde service ended in     Ultralight Helicopter Personal Aerial Vehicle Ultralight helicopters   have

workaround For the American music magazine see Kludge magazine A network kludge Part of the Miles Glacier Bridge with a \"kludge\" temporary fix to make the bridge usable after earthquake damage A kludge or kluge / k l d k l u d / is a workaround or quick-and-dirty solution that is clumsy inelegant inefficient difficult to extend and hard to maintain This term is used in diverse fields such as computer science aerospace engineering Internet slang evolutionary neuroscience and government Contents   Pronunciation and etymology     Jackson W Granholm     Yiddish     European surname     Military jargon     Paper feeder     Acronym   Industries     Aerospace engineering     Computer science     Evolutionary neuroscience   Other uses       References     Pronunciation and etymology edit The word has alternate spellings kludge and kluge pronunciations / k l d / and / k l u d / rhyming with judge and stooge respectively and several proposed etymologies Jackson W Granholm edit In the Oxford English Dictionary 2nd ed   the kludge entry cites one source for this word's earliest recorded usage definition and etymology Jackson W Granholm's   \"How to Design a Kludge\" article which appeared in the American computer magazine Datamation   kludge /klu d / Also kluge J W Granholm's jocular invention see first quot cf also bodge v fudge v   'An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts forming a distressing whole' Granholm esp in Computing a machine system or program that has been improvised or 'bodged' together a hastily improvised and poorly thought-out solution to a fault or 'bug' Although OED accepts Granholm's definition and credits him with the invention examples of its use before the 1960s exist A source of some confusion has been Granholm's jocular citation of the wholly fictitious lexicographer Phineas Burling of the firm \"Fink and Wiggles\" for Funk & Wagnalls as confirming the Germanic origin of the word A phone call to Phineas Burling can be revealing Phineas Burling is the Chief calligrapher with the Fink and Wiggles Publishing Company Inc Fink and Wiggles are of course the well known publishers of the NEW MULTILINGUAL DICTIONARY According to Burling the word \"kludge\" first appeared in the English language in the early fifteen-hundreds It was imported into the geographic region of the lowlands between King's Lynn then Bishop's Lynn and the Isle of Ely by Dutch settlers arriving there to reclaim tidelands of the Wash as rutabaga fields The word \"kludge\" is according to Burling derived from the same root as the German \"klug\" Dutch kloog Swedish Klag Danish Klog Gothic Klaugen Lettish Kladnis and Sanskrit Veklaunn originally meaning \"smart\" or \"witty\" In the typical machinations of language in evolutionary growth the word \"Kludge\" eventually came to mean \"not so smart\" or \"pretty ridiculous\" Today the leading definition given by the NEW MULTILINGUAL is \"An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts forming a distressing whole \" It is in this latter sense that \"Kludge\" is used by computer hardware men Today \"kludge\" forms one of the most beloved words in design terminology and it stands ready for handy application to the work of anyone who gins up 110-volt circuitry to plug into the   VAC source The building of a Kludge however is not work for amateurs There is a certain indefinable masochistic finesse that must go into true Kludge building The professional can spot it instantly The amateur may readily presume that \"that's the way computers are\"   Claims about derivation from the German adjective klug \"clever\" are unlikely for the following reasons There is no equivalent usage in German Both pronunciations of the word contain the soft \"g\" d which is not present in German The word emerges in English only in the 20th century Yiddish edit American Yiddish speakers use klug to mean \"too smart by half\" the reflected meaning of German klug \"clever\" This may explain the idea of clever but clumsy and temporary as well as the pronunciation variation from German   European surname edit It may instead derive from the mispronunciation of European surname Kluge be that German Dutch or Scandinavian Even if Burling's etymology were true it is doubtful that the American military or computer engineers who began using the term in the 20th century could have been aware of a term that had fallen from use in East Anglia sometime in the preceding   years This OED2 entry also includes the verb kludge \"to improvise with a kludge or kludges\" and kludgemanship \"skill in designing or applying kludges\" Military jargon edit The Jargon File a k a The New Hacker's Dictionary which is a glossary of computer programmer slang maintained by Eric S Raymond differentiates kludge from kluge and cites usage examples predating   kludge /kluhj/ n Incorrect though regrettably common spelling of kluge US These two words have been confused in American usage since the early 1960s and widely confounded in Great Britain since the end of World War II TMRC A crock that works A long-ago Datamation article by Jackson Granholme sic similarly said \"An ill-assorted collection of poorly matching parts forming a distressing whole \" v To use a kludge to get around a problem \"I've kludged around it for now but I'll fix it up properly later \"   This Jargon File entry notes kludge apparently derives via British military slang from Scots cludge or cludgie     meaning \"a common toilet\" and became confused with U S kluge during or after World War II kluge /klooj/ from the German 'klug' clever poss related to Polish & Russian 'klucz' a key a hint a main point n A Rube Goldberg or Heath Robinson device whether in hardware or software n A clever programming trick intended to solve a particular nasty case in an expedient if not clear manner Often used to repair bugs Often involves ad-hockery and verges on being a crock n Something that works for the wrong reason vt To insert a kluge into a program \"I've kluged this routine to get around that weird bug but there's probably a better way \" WPI n A feature that is implemented in a rude manner   This entry notes kluge which is now often spelled kludge \"was the original spelling reported around computers as far back as the mid-1950s and at that time used exclusively of hardware kluges\" The Jargon File gives possible etymologies from naval slang cf jury rig or printing equipment Kluge \"was common Navy slang in the World War II era for any piece of electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at sea\" A   article in the New York Folklore Quarterly recorded the classic shaggy dog story \"'Murgatroyd the Kluge Maker' then current in the Armed Forces in which a 'kluge' was a complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function \"   The term kluge as an overcomplicated or obscure contraption dates back at least to   as evidenced by the article in the New York Folklore Quarterly   but the term must have been in use long before that for the story to have any sense The following purports to be a summary of the original article that is somewhat more complete than the one quoted above On being drafted into the navy Murgatroyd gave his profession as \"kluge maker\" Not wanting to seem ignorant the clerk simply wrote this down Whenever Murgatroyd was asked what he was doing he said he was making a kluge and actually he was one of the world's best kluge makers Not wanting to seem ignorant his superiors kept giving him commendations and promotions until he reached the dizzy heights of commodore One day the admiral came to inspect the ship When Murgatroyd explained he was a kluge maker the admiral asked him what a kluge was the first person ever to do so Murgatroyd said it was hard to explain but he would make one so the admiral could see what it was After a couple of days he returned with a complex object \"Interesting \" said the admiral \"but what does it do?\" In reply Murgatroyd dropped it over the side of the ship As the thing sank it went \"kluge\"   The Jargon File further includes kluge around \"to avoid a bug or difficult condition by inserting a kluge\" kluge up \"to lash together a quick hack to perform a task\" After Granholm's   \"How to Design a Kludge\" article popularized the kluge variant kludge both were interchangeably used and confused The Jargon File concludes The result of this history is a tangle Many younger U S hackers pronounce the word as /klooj/ but spell it incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation as 'kludge' British hackers mostly learned /kluhj/ orally use it in a restricted negative sense and are at least consistent European hackers have mostly learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it /kluhj/ but use the wider American meaning! Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word's meaning Paper feeder edit Another hypothesis dates to   \"when John Brandtjen convinced two young machinists from Oslo Norway named Abel and Eneval Kluge to service and install presses for his fledgling printing equipment firm\" In   the brothers invented an automatic feeder for printing presses which by   allowed Brandtjen and Kluge to move into a 3-story building in St Paul MN While the automatic feeder was a success unverified sources claim that it developed a reputation for being \"temperamental subject to frequent breakdowns and devilishly difficult to repair but oh so clever!\" The Kluge brothers continued to innovate and the company remained active as of   Given that the feeder bore the Kluge name it seems reasonable that it became a byword for over-complex mechanical contraptions The Free Online Dictionary of Computing FOLDOC claims that the term kluge \"was used in connection with computers as far back as the mid-1950s and at that time was used exclusively for hardware kluges\"   The fact that it was originally applied only to hardware again points back to the paper feeder as the origin FOLDOC goes on to say \" TMRC and the MIT hacker culture of the early 1960s seems to have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used some WWII military slang see also foobar It seems likely that 'kluge' came to MIT via alumni of the many military electronics projects run in Cambridge during the war many in MIT's venerable Building   which housed TMRC until the building was demolished in   \" This would explain the term's introduction to the software community This explanation points to a Norwegian surname as the source with no connection to German Acronym edit Other suggested folk etymologies or backronyms for kludge or kluge is from k lumsy l ame u gly d umb but g ood e nough or k lutzy l ashup u nder- g oing e ngineering   The word kluge stems from a German name which means 'not so smart ' The term kludge would then seem to have independent origins possibly in Britain The terms tended to merge because of their similar pronunciations and meanings However kluge seems to have the sense of overcomplicated while kludge has only the sense of poorly done Cf German Klo \"clod\" diminutive Kl chen Low Saxon klut klute Dutch kluit   perhaps related to Low German diminutive kl tje \"dumpling clod\" Danish Jutland dial klyt \"piece of bad workmanship kludge\"   and Standard Danish kludder \"mess disorder\" Industries edit Aerospace engineering edit In aerospace a kludge was a temporary design using separate commonly available components that were not flightworthy in order to proof the design and enable concurrent software development while the integrated components were developed and manufactured The term was in common enough use to appear in a fictional movie about the US space program   Perhaps the ultimate kludge was the first US space station Skylab Its two major components the Saturn Workshop and the Apollo Telescope Mount began development as separate projects the SWS was kludged from the S-IVB stage of the Saturn 1B and Saturn V launch vehicles the ATM was kludged from an early design for the descent stage of the Apollo Lunar Module Later the SWS and ATM were folded into the Apollo Applications Program but the components were to have been launched separately then docked in orbit In the final design the SWS and ATM were launched together but for the single-launch concept to work the ATM had to pivot   degrees on a truss structure from its launch position to its on-orbit orientation clearing the way for the crew to dock its Apollo Command/Service Module at the axial docking port of the Multiple Docking Adapter The Airlock Module's manufacturer McDonnell Douglas even recycled the hatch design from its Gemini spacecraft and kludged what was originally designed for the conical Gemini Command Module onto the cylindrical Skylab Airlock Module The Skylab project managed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's Marshall Space Flight Center was seen by the Manned Spacecraft Center later Johnson Space Center as an invasion of its historical role as the NASA center for manned spaceflight Thus MSC personnel missed no opportunity to disparage the Skylab project calling it \"the kludge\" citation needed Computer science edit In modern computing terminology a \"kludge\" or often a \" hack \" is a solution to a problem doing a task or fixing a system that is inefficient inelegant \"hacky\" or even unfathomable but which nevertheless more or less works To \"kludge around something\" is to avoid a bug or some difficult condition by building a kludge perhaps relying on properties of the bug itself to assure proper operation It is somewhat similar in spirit to a workaround only without the grace A kludge is often used to change the behavior of a system after it is finished without having to make fundamental changes Sometimes the kludge is introduced in order to keep backwards compatibility but often it is simply introduced because the kludge is an easier alternative Note that a hack might be a kludge but that hack could be at least in computing ironic praise for a quick fix solution to a frustrating problem   A kludge is often used to fix an unanticipated problem in an earlier kludge this is essentially a kind of cruft Something might be a kludge if it fails in corner cases but this is a less common sense as such situations are not expected to come up in typical usage More commonly a kludge is a poorly working heuristic which was expected to work adequately An intimate knowledge of the context i e problem domain and/or the kludge's execution environment is typically required to build a corner case kludge As a consequence they are sometimes ironically praised An anecdotal example of a kludge involved a computer part supposedly manufactured in the Soviet Union during the 1960s The part needed slightly delayed receipt of a signal to work Rather than setting up a timing system the kludge was to make the internal wires extra-long increasing the distance and thus increasing the time the electrical signal took to reach its destination citation needed A variation on this use of kludge is evasion of an unknown problem or bug in a computer program Rather than continue to struggle to find out exactly what is causing the bug and how to fix it the programmer may hack the problem by the simple kludge of writing new code which compensates For example if a variable keeps ending up doubled in a certain code area add code which divides by two when it is used after the original code has been executed In computer networking use of NAT Network Address Translation RFC   or PAT Port Address Translation to cope with the shortage of IPv4 addresses is an example of a kludge In FidoNet terminology kludge refers to a piece of control data embedded inside a message Evolutionary neuroscience edit   Evolutionary baggage The kludge or kluge metaphor has been adapted in fields such as evolutionary neuroscience particularly in reference to the human brain The neuroscientist David Linden discusses how intelligent design proponents have misconstrued brain anatomy The transcendent aspects of our human experience the things that touch our emotional and cognitive core were not given to us by a Great Engineer These are not the latest design features of an impeccably crafted brain Rather at every turn brain design has been a kludge a workaround a jumble a pastiche The things we hold highest in our human experience love memory dreams and a predisposition for religious thought result from a particular agglomeration of ad hoc solutions that have been piled on through millions of years of evolution history It's not that we have fundamentally human thoughts and feelings despite the kludgy design of the brain as molded by the twists and turns of evolutionary history Rather we have them precisely because of that history   The research psychologist Gary Marcus 's book Kluge The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind compares evolutionary kluges with engineering ones like manifold vacuum -powered windshield wipers when you accelerated or drove uphill \"Your wipers slowed to a crawl or even stopped working altogether \" For instance the vertebrate eye's retina that is installed backward facing the back of the head rather than the front As a result all kinds of stuff gets in its way including a bunch of wiring that passes through the eye and leaves us with a pair of blind spots one in each eye   Other uses edit In the science fiction television series Andromeda genetically engineered human beings called Nietzscheans use the term disparagingly to refer to genetically unmodified humans In John Varley 's   short story \"Press Enter \" the antagonist a reclusive hacker with unprecedented access to many databases adopts the identity Charles Kluge In a   article the political scientist Steven Teles used the term \"kludgeocracy\" to criticize the complexity of social welfare policy in the United States In the paper Teles argues that institutional and political obstacles to passing legislation often drives policy makers to accept temporary imperfect fixes rather than carefully thought out reforms       edit Wikimedia

directed towards socially sustainable outcomes   It is intended to handle 'seemingly intractable problems'   such as outlined in sustainable development debates The method is mostly used for cities and urban settlements Circles of Sustainability and its treatment of the social domains of ecology economics politics and culture provides the empirical dimension of an approach called ' engaged theory ' Developing Circles of Sustainability is part of larger project called 'Circles of Social Life' using the same four-domain model to analyze questions of resilience adaptation security reconciliation It is also being used in relation to thematics such as 'Circles of Child Wellbeing' with World Vision The rationale for this new method is clear As evidenced by Rio+20 and the UN Habitat World Urban Forum in Napoli   and Medellin   sustainability assessment is on the global agenda   However the more complex the problems the less useful current sustainability assessment tools seem to be for assessing across different domains economics ecology politics and culture   For example the Triple Bottom Line approach tends to take the economy as its primary point of focus with the domain of the environmental as the key externality Secondly the one-dimensional quantitative basis of many such methods means that they have limited purchase on complex qualitative issues Thirdly the size scope and sheer number of indicators included within many such methods means that they are often unwieldy and resist effective implementation Fourthly the restricted focus of current indicator sets means that they do not work across different organizational and social settings corporations and other institutions cities and communities   Most indicator approaches such as the Global Reporting Initiative or ISO14031 have been limited to large corporate organizations with easily definable legal and economic boundaries Circles of Sustainability was developed to respond to those limitations

fundamental dissatisfaction with current approaches to sustainability and sustainable development which tended to treat economics as the core domain and ecology as an externality Two concurrent developments provided impetus a major project in Porto Alegre and a United Nations paper called Accounting for Sustainability Briefing Paper No     The researchers developed a method and an integrated set of tools for assessing and monitoring issues of sustainability while providing guidance for project development   The method was then further refined through projects in Melbourne and Milwaukee and through an ARC-funded cross-disciplinary project   that partnered with various organizations including Microsoft Australia Fuji Xerox Australia the City of Melbourne World Vision UN-Habitat and most crucially Metropolis   In Canada the Green Score City Index   was inspired by studying the UN circle of sustainability However unlike this system the Canadian index data-sets are focused on measuring the physical footprints of human activity and greenspace footprints which are less subjectivity than cultural and economic   indicators Use of the method edit The method is used by a series of global organizations including the United Nations Global Compact Cities Programme The World Association of Major Metropolises   and World Vision to support their engagement in cities It is also used by a number of cities across the world in different ways to manage major projects or to provide feedback on their sustainability profiles e g Hyderabad Johannesburg Melbourne New Delhi S o Paulo and Tehran It is a method for understanding urban politics and urban planning as well as for conducting sustainability analysis and profiling sustainable development Global Compact Cities Programme edit The methodology is made available by UN Global Compact Cities Programme for its engagement with its more than   Signatory Cities In particular some of the   Innovating Cities in the programme have influenced the development of the Circles of Sustainability method through their management of major projects some with intensity and others as a background feature They use a cross-sectoral and holistic approach for developing a response to self-defined seemingly intractable problems   Porto Alegre Vila Chocolat o project edit The Vila Chocolat o project refers to the   resettlement of approximately     residents of the inner-city Vila Chocolat o slum in Porto Alegre Brazil The resettlement project of Vila Chocolat o commenced in   in response to an imminent eviction of the community with community members seeking resources and support to resettle through the city of Porto Alegre's renown participatory budgeting system The lengthy preparation to resettle was led by a local cross-sectoral network group the Vila Chocolat o Sustainability Network The group was initially instigated by the Regional Court TRF4 and consisted of the Vila Chocolat o Residents Association local government departments federal agencies non-government organisations and the corporate sector The project was supported by the City of Porto Alegre through the municipality s Local Solidarity Governance Scheme In   the Vila Chocolatao resettlement project was recognised as a pilot project for the then new Cities Programme cross-sectoral model with City Hall assembling a Critical Reference Group to identify critical issues and joint solutions to those issues involved in the resettlement This long-standing collaborative project has been successful in rehousing a whole community of slum dwellers it has also effected a restructuring of how the city approaches slums The project ensured sustainability was built into the relocation through changes such as setting up of recycling depots next to existing slums and developing a formal recycling sorting facility in the new site Residencial Nova Chocolat o linked to the garbage-collection process of the city an example of linking the sub-domains of emission and waste and organization and governance and establishing a fully resourced early childhood centre in the new community The Vila Chocolat o Sustainability Network group continues to meet and work with the community post the resettlement This network-led model is now being utilized by the City of Porto Alegre with other informal settlements Milwaukee water sustainability project edit In   Milwaukee Wisconsin United States of America wanted to address the issue of water quality in the city   The Circles of Sustainability methodology became the basis for an integrated city project In the period of the application of the method   present there has been a rediscovery of the value of water from an industry and broader community perspective   In   Milwaukee won the United States Water Prize given by the Clean Water America Alliance as well as a prize from IBM Better Cities program worth $500   The community has also attracted some leading water treatment innovators and is establishing a graduate School of Freshwater Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee   Metropolis World Association of the Major Metropolises edit The methodology was first used by Metropolis for Commission     Managing Urban Growth This Commission which met across the period     was asked to make recommendations for use by Metropolis s   member cities on the theme of managing growth The Commission Report using the Circles of Sustainability methodology was published on the web in three languages English French and Spanish and is used by member cities as a guide to practice   In   the research team were invited by Metropolis to work with the Victorian Government and the Cities Programme on one of their major initiatives The methodology is central to the approach used by the Integrated Strategic Planning and Public-Private Partnerships Initiative organized by Metropolis     for Indian Brazilian and Iranian cities A workshop was held in New Delhi     July   and senior planners from New Delhi Hyderabad and Kolkata used the two of the assessment tools in the Circles of Sustainability toolbox to map the sustainability of their cities as part of developing their urban-regional plans Other cities to use the same tools have been Tehran in relation to their mega-projects plan and S o Paulo in relation to their macro-metropolitan plan   Since   the Cities Programme and Metropolis have worked together to refine the 'Circles of Sustainability' method to use with their respective member cities A Metropolis Taskforce was charged with further developing the method The Economist edit In   The Economist invited Paul James Director of the UN Global Compact Cities Programme and Chetan Vedya Director National Institute of Urban Affairs India into a debate around the question of urban sustainability and metropolitan growth It led to over   letters to the editor in direct response as well as numerous linked citations on other websites   World Vision edit In   recognising how much the two processes of urbanization and globalization were changing the landscape of poverty World Vision decided to shift its orientation towards urban settings Previously   per cent of its projects had been in small rural communities The Circles of Sustainability method now underpins that reorientation and pilot studies are being conducted in India South Africa Lebanon Indonesia and elsewhere to refine the methodology for aid delivery in complex urban settings Domains and subdomains edit The Circles of Sustainability approach is explicitly critical of other domain models such as the triple bottom line that treat economics as if it is outside the social or that treat the environment as an externality It uses a four-domain model - economics ecology politics and culture In each of these domains there are   subdomains Economics edit The economic domain is defined as the practices and meanings associated with the production use and management of resources where the concept of resources is used in the broadest sense of that word Production and resourcing Exchange and transfer Accounting and regulation Consumption and use Labour and welfare Technology and infrastructure Wealth and distribution Ecology edit The ecological domain is defined as the practices and meanings that occur across the intersection between the social and the natural realms focusing on the important dimension of human engagement with and within nature but also including the built-environment Materials and energy Water and air Flora and fauna Habitat and settlements Built-form and transport Embodiment and sustenance Emission and waste Politics edit The political is defined as the practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power such as organization authorization legitimation and regulation The parameters of this area extend beyond the conventional sense of politics to include not only issues of public and private governance but more broadly social relations in general Organization and governance Law and justice Communication and critique Representation and negotiation Security and accord Dialogue and reconciliation Ethics and accountability Culture edit The cultural domain is defined as the practices discourses and material expressions which over time express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning Identity and engagement Creativity and recreation Memory and projection Belief and ideas Gender and generations Enquiry and learning Wellbeing and health   edit Applied sustainability

management of forests according to the principles of sustainable development Sustainable forest management has to keep the balance between three main pillars ecological economic and socio-cultural Successfully achieving sustainable forest management will provide integrated benefits to all ranging from safeguarding local livelihoods to protecting the biodiversity and ecosystems provided by forests reducing rural poverty and mitigating some of the effects of climate change   The \" Forest Principles \" adopted at The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development UNCED in Rio de Janeiro in   captured the general international understanding of sustainable forest management at that time A number of sets of criteria and indicators have since been developed to evaluate the achievement of SFM at the global regional country and management unit level These were all attempts to codify and provide for independent assessment of the degree to which the broader objectives of sustainable forest management are being achieved in practice In   the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests The instrument was the first of its kind and reflected the strong international commitment to promote implementation of sustainable forest management through a new approach that brings all stakeholders together   Contents

National reports on progress toward sustainable forest management Definition edit A definition of SFM was developed by the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe FOREST EUROPE and has since been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO   It defines sustainable forest management as The stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way and at a rate that maintains their biodiversity productivity regeneration capacity vitality and their potential to fulfill now and in the future relevant ecological economic and social functions at local national and global levels and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems In simpler terms the concept can be described as the attainment of balance balance between society's increasing demands for forest products and benefits and the preservation of forest health and diversity This balance is critical to the survival of forests and to the prosperity of forest-dependent communities For forest managers sustainably managing a particular forest tract means determining in a tangible way how to use it today to ensure similar benefits health and productivity in the future Forest managers must assess and integrate a wide array of sometimes conflicting factors commercial and non-commercial values environmental considerations community needs   even global impact to produce sound forest plans In most cases forest managers develop their forest plans in consultation with citizens businesses organizations and other interested parties in and around the forest tract being managed The tools and visualization have been recently evolving for better management practices   The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at the request of Member States developed and launched the Sustainable Forest Management Toolbox in   an online collection of tools best practices and examples of their application to support countries implementing sustainable forest management   Because forests and societies are in constant flux the desired outcome of sustainable forest management is not a fixed one What constitutes a sustainably managed forest will change over time as values held by the public change Criteria and indicators edit Deforestation of native rain forest in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of clay for civil engineering   picture An example of non sustainable forest management   Criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management Criteria and indicators are tools which can be used to conceptualise evaluate and implement sustainable forest management   Criteria define and characterize the essential elements as well as a set of conditions or processes by which sustainable forest management may be assessed Periodically measured indicators reveal the direction of change with respect to each criterion Criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management are widely used and many countries produce national reports that assess their progress toward sustainable forest management There are nine international and regional criteria and indicators initiatives which collectively involve more than   countries   Three of the more advanced initiatives are those of the Working Group on Criteria and Indicators for the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Temperate and Boreal Forests also called the Montr al Process   Forest Europe   and the International Tropical Timber Organization   Countries who are members of the same initiative usually agree to produce reports at the same time and using the same indicators Within countries at the management unit level efforts have also been directed at developing local level criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management The Center for International Forestry Research the International Model Forest Network   and researchers at the University of British Columbia have developed a number of tools and techniques to help forest-dependent communities develop their own local level criteria and indicators       Criteria and Indicators also form the basis of third-party forest certification programs such as the Canadian Standards Association 's   Sustainable Forest Management Standards and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative Standard   There appears to be growing international consensus on the key elements of sustainable forest management Seven common thematic areas of sustainable forest management have emerged based on the criteria of the nine ongoing regional and international criteria and indicators initiatives The seven thematic areas are Extent of forest resources Biological diversity Forest health and vitality Productive functions and forest resources Protective functions of forest resources Socio-economic functions Legal policy and institutional framework This consensus on common thematic areas or criteria effectively provides a common implicit definition of sustainable forest management The seven thematic areas were acknowledged by the international forest community at the fourth session of the United Nations Forum on Forests and the 16th session of the Committee on Forestry     These thematic areas have since been enshrined in the Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests as a reference framework for sustainable forest management to help achieve the purpose of the instrument On January     the Montr al Process Forest Europe the International Tropical Timber Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations acknowledging the seven thematic areas endorsed a joint statement of collaboration to improve global forest related data collection and reporting and avoiding the proliferation of monitoring requirements and associated reporting burdens Ecosystem approach edit The Ecosystem Approach has been prominent on the agenda of the Convention on Biological Diversity CBD since   The CBD definition of the Ecosystem Approach and a set of principles for its application were developed at an expert meeting in Malawi in   known as the Malawi Principles   The definition   principles and   points of \"operational guidance\" were adopted by the fifth Conference of Parties COP5 in   The CBD definition is as follows The ecosystem approach is a strategy for the integrated management of land water and living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way Application of the ecosystem approach will help to reach a balance of the three objectives of the Convention An ecosystem approach is based on the application of appropriate scientific methodologies focused on levels of biological organization which encompasses the essential structures processes functions and interactions among organisms and their environment It recognizes that humans with their cultural diversity are an integral component of many ecosystems Sustainable forest management was recognized by parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in   Decision VII/11 of COP7 to be a concrete means of applying the Ecosystem Approach to forest ecosystems The two concepts sustainable forest management and the ecosystem approach aim at promoting conservation and management practices which are environmentally socially and economically sustainable and which generate and maintain benefits for both present and future generations In Europe the MCPFE and the Council for the Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy PEBLDS jointly recognized sustainable forest management to be consistent with the Ecosystem Approach in           Independent certification edit   Certified wood Growing environmental awareness and consumer demand for more socially responsible businesses helped third-party forest certification emerge in the 1990s as a credible tool for communicating the environmental and social performance of forest operations There are many potential users of certification including forest managers scientists policy makers investors environmental advocates business consumers of wood and paper and individuals With third-party forest certification an independent organization develops standards of good forest management and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards Forest certification verifies that forests are well-managed as defined by a particular standard and chain-of-custody certification tracks wood and paper products from the certified forest through processing to the point of sale This rise of certification led to the emergence of several different systems throughout the world As a result there is no single accepted forest management standard worldwide and each system takes a somewhat different approach in defining standards for sustainable forest management In its     Forest Products Annual Market Review United Nations Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agriculture Organization stated \"Over the years many of the issues that previously divided the certification systems have become much less distinct The largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements \"   Third-party forest certification is an important tool for those seeking to ensure that the paper and wood products they purchase and use come from forests that are well-managed and legally harvested Incorporating third-party certification into forest product procurement practices can be a centerpiece for comprehensive wood and paper policies that include factors such as the protection of sensitive forest values thoughtful material selection and efficient use of products   There are more than fifty certification standards worldwide addressing the diversity of forest types and tenures Globally the two largest umbrella certification programs are Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification PEFC Forest Stewardship Council FSC The area of forest certified worldwide is growing slowly PEFC is the world's largest forest certification system with more than two-thirds of the total global certified area certified to its Sustainability Benchmarks     In North America there are three certification standards endorsed by PEFC the Sustainable Forestry Initiative   the Canadian Standards Association's Sustainable Forest Management Standard   and the American Tree Farm System   FSC has five standards in North America one in the United States   and four in Canada   While certification is intended as a tool to enhance forest management practices throughout the world to date most certified forestry operations are located in Europe and North America A significant barrier for many forest managers in developing countries is that they lack the capacity to undergo a certification audit and maintain operations to a certification standard   Forest governance edit Countries participating in the UNREDD program and/or Forest Carbon Partnership Facility UN-REDD participants Forest Carbon Partnership Facility participants participants in both Although a majority of forests continue to be owned formally by government the effectiveness of forest governance is increasingly independent of formal ownership   Since neo-liberal ideology in the 1980s and the emanation of the climate change challenges evidence that the state is failing to effectively manage environmental resources has emerged   Under neo-liberal regimes in the developing countries the role of the state has diminished and the market forces have increasingly taken over the dominant socio-economic role   Though the critiques of neo-liberal policies have maintained that market forces are not only inappropriate for sustaining the environment but are in fact a major cause of environmental destruction   Hardin's tragedy of the commons   has shown that the people cannot be left to do as they wish with land or environmental resources Thus decentralization of management offers an alternative solution to forest governance   The shifting of natural resource management responsibilities from central to state and local governments where this is occurring is usually a part of broader decentralization process   According to Rondinelli and Cheema   there are four distinct decentralization options these are i Privatization the transfer of authority from the central government to non-governmental sectors otherwise known as market-based service provision ii Delegation centrally nominated local authority iii Devolution transfer of power to locally acceptable authority and iv Deconcentration the redistribution of authority from the central government to field delegations of the central government The major key to effective decentralization is increased broad-based participation in local-public decision making In   the World Bank report reveals that local government knows the needs and desires of their constituents better than the national government while at the same time it is easier to hold local leaders accountable From the study of West African tropical forest it is argued that the downwardly accountable and/or representative authorities with meaningful discretional powers are the basic institutional element of decentralization that should lead to efficiency development and equity   This collaborates with the World Bank report in   which says that decentralization should improve resource allocation efficiency accountability and equity \"by linking the cost and benefit of local services more closely\"   Many reasons point to the advocacy of decentralization of forest i Integrated rural development projects often fail because they are top-down projects that did not take local people's needs and desires into account   ii National government sometimes have legal authority over vast forest areas that they cannot control   thus many protected area projects result in increased biodiversity loss and greater social conflict   Within the sphere of forest management as state earlier the most effective option of decentralization is \"devolution\"-the transfer of power to locally accountable authority   However apprehension about local governments is not unfounded They are often short of resources may be staffed by people with low education and are sometimes captured by local elites who promote clientelist relation rather than democratic participation   Enters and Anderson   point that the result of community-based projects intended to reverse the problems of past central approaches to conservation and development have also been discouraging Broadly speaking the goal of forest conservation has historically not been met when in contrast with land use changes driven by demand for food fuel and profit   It is necessary to recognize and advocate for better forest governance more strongly given the importance of forest in meeting basic human needs in the future and maintaining ecosystem and biodiversity as well as addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation goal   Such advocacy must be coupled with financial incentives for government of developing countries and greater governance role for local government civil society private sector and NGOs on behalf of the \"communities\"   National Forest Funds edit The development of National Forest Funds is one way to address the issue of financing sustainable forest management   National forest funds NFFs are dedicated financing mechanisms managed by public institutions designed to support the conservation and sustainable use of forest resources   As of   there are   NFFs operating globally   Forest genetic resources edit Appropriate use and long-term conservation of forest genetic resources FGR is a part of sustainable forest management   In particular when it comes to the adaptation of forests and forest management to climate change   Genetic diversity ensures that forest trees can survive adapt and evolve under changing environmental conditions Genetic diversity in forests also contributes to tree vitality and to the resilience towards pests and diseases Furthermore FGR has a crucial role in maintaining forest biological diversity at both species and ecosystem levels   Selecting carefully the plant material with emphasis on getting a high genetic diversity rather than aiming at producing a uniform stand of trees is essential for sustainable use of FGR Considering the provenance is crucial as well For example in relation to climate change local material may not have the genetic diversity or phenotypic plasticity to guarantee good performance under changed conditions A different population from further away which may have experienced selection under conditions more like those forecast for the site to be reforested might represent a more suitable seed source     edit Biodiversity Conservation biology Ecosystem management Ecosystem-based management Environmental protection Forest conservation in

As of May     the world's human population is estimated to be     billion by the United States Census Bureau   and over   billion by the United Nations       Most contemporary estimates for the carrying capacity of the Earth under existing conditions are between   billion and   billion Depending on which estimate is used human overpopulation may or may not have already occurred Nevertheless the rapid recent increase in human population is causing some concern The population is expected to reach between   and     billion between the years       and     In   the United Nations increased the medium variant projections to     billion for   and     billion for     The recent rapid increase in human population over the past three centuries has raised concerns that the planet may not be able to sustain present or future numbers of inhabitants The InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth circa   stated that many environmental problems such as rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide global warming and pollution are aggravated by the population expansion   Other problems associated with overpopulation include the increased demand for resources such as fresh water and food starvation and malnutrition consumption of natural resources such as fossil fuels faster than the rate of regeneration and a deterioration in living conditions Wealthy but highly populated territories like Britain rely on food imports from overseas   This was severely felt during the World Wars when despite food efficiency initiatives like \" dig for victory \" and food rationing Britain needed to fight to secure import routes However many believe that waste and over-consumption especially by wealthy nations is putting more strain on the environment than overpopulation   Most countries have no direct policy of limiting their birth rates but the rates have still fallen due to education about family planning and increasing access to birth control and contraception citation needed History of concern edit Thousands of scooters make their way through Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam Concern about overpopulation is an ancient topic Tertullian was a resident of the city of Carthage in the second century CE when the population of the world was about   million only   4% of what it is today He notably said \"What most frequently meets our view and occasions complaint is our teeming population Our numbers are burdensome to the world which can hardly support us In very deed pestilence and famine and wars and earthquakes have to be regarded as a remedy for nations as the means of pruning the luxuriance of the human race \" Before that Plato Aristotle and others broached the topic as well   Throughout recorded history population growth has usually been slow despite high birth rates due to war plagues and other diseases and high infant mortality During the   years before the Industrial Revolution the world's population increased very slowly remaining under   million   By the beginning of the 19th century the world population had grown to a billion individuals and intellectuals such as Thomas Malthus predicted that humankind would outgrow its available resources because a finite amount of land would be incapable of supporting a population with a limitless potential for increase   Mercantillists argued that a large population was a form of wealth which made it possible to create bigger markets and armies During the 19th century Malthus's work was often interpreted in a way that blamed the poor alone for their condition and helping them was said to worsen conditions in the long run   This resulted for example in the English poor laws of     and in a hesitating response to the Irish Great Famine of       The UN Population Assessment Report of   projects that the world population will plateau by   and will remain stable until     A   study published in Science challenges this projection asserting that population growth will continue into the next century     Adrian Raftery a University of Washington professor of statistics and sociology and one of the contributors to the study says \"The consensus over the past   years or so was that world population which is currently around   billion would go up to   billion and level off or probably decline We found there's a   percent probability the world population will not stabilize this century Population which had sort of fallen off the world's agenda remains a very important issue \"   A more recent UN projection suggests the population could grow to as many as   billion by     In   more than a third of   Nobel prize-winning scientists surveyed by the Times Higher Education at the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings said that human overpopulation and environmental degradation are the two greatest threats facing humankind   In November that same year a statement by     scientists from   countries indicated that rapid human population growth is the \"primary driver behind many ecological and even societal threats \"   Human population edit \" It is a myth to say that our population is strength I believe that our population is only strength if it is well educated if it is healthy if the economy in which they reside has the capacity to provide them with jobs and the people living in the households earn good income and are able to afford the goods and services provided

growth edit   World population Data from World Population Population   Year Billion                               estimate   The human population has gone through a number of periods of growth since the dawn of civilization in the Holocene period around     BCE The beginning of civilization roughly coincides with the receding of glacial ice following the end of the last glacial period   It is estimated that between     million people subsisting on hunting and foraging inhabited the Earth in the period before the Neolithic Revolution when human activity shifted away from hunter-gathering and towards very primitive farming   Around   BCE at the dawn of agriculture the population of the world was approximately   million   The next several millennia saw a steady increase in the population with very rapid growth beginning in   BCE and a peak of between   and   million people in   BCE The Plague of Justinian caused Europe's population to drop by around 50% between   and the 8th century   Steady growth resumed in   CE   However growth was again disrupted by frequent plagues most notably the Black Death during the 14th century The effects of the Black Death are thought to have reduced the world's population then at an estimated   million to between   and   million by     The population of Europe stood at over   million in     these levels did not return until   years later   England's population reached an estimated     million in   up from an estimated     million in     New crops from the Americas via the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century contributed to the population growth   In other parts of the globe China's population at the founding of the Ming dynasty in   stood close to   million approaching   million by the end of the dynasty in       The population of the Americas in   may have been between   and   million   Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence Archaeological evidence indicates that the death of around 90% of the Native American population of the New World was caused by Old World diseases such as smallpox measles and influenza   Europeans introduced diseases alien to the indigenous people therefore they did not have immunity to these foreign diseases   After the start of the Industrial Revolution during the 18th century the rate of population growth began to increase By the end of the century the world's population was estimated at just under   billion   At the turn of the 20th century the world's population was roughly     billion   By   this figure had increased to     billion   Each subsequent addition of a billion humans took less and less time   years to reach three billion in     years for four billion in     years for five billion in   and   years for six billion in     Dramatic growth beginning in   above   8% per year coincided with greatly increased food production as a result of the industrialization of agriculture brought about by the Green Revolution   The rate of human population growth peaked in   at about   1% per year   For example Indonesia 's population grew from   million in   to     million in       a 145% increase in   years In India the population grew from     million people in   to just over     billion by       a 235% increase in   years Continent   population   Africa   million Asia   million Europe   million Latin America and Caribbean   million North America   million There is concern over the sharp population increase in many countries especially in Sub-Saharan Africa that has occurred over the last several decades and that it is creating problems with land management natural resources and access to water supplies   The population of Chad has for example grown from       in   to       in     Niger Uganda Nigeria Tanzania Ethiopia and the DRC are witnessing a similar growth in population The situation is most acute in western central and eastern Africa   Refugees from places like Sudan have further strained the resources of neighboring states like Chad and Egypt Chad is also host to roughly     refugees from Sudan's Darfur region and about     refugees from the Central African Republic while approximately     Chadians have been displaced by their own civil war and famines have either fled to either the Sudan the Niger or more recently Libya

North America   million According to projections the world population will continue to grow until at least   with the population reaching   billion in       and some predictions putting the population as high as   billion in     By   the population could reach   billion   Walter Greiling projected in the 1950s that world population would reach a peak of about nine billion in the 21st century and then stop growing after a readjustment of the Third World and a sanitation of the tropics   In   the United Nations estimated that the world's population was growing at the rate of   14% or about   million people per year and according to data from the CIA's World Factbook the world human population currently increases by   every minute   According to the United Nations' World Population Prospects report   Net annual human population increase by country   The world population is currently growing by approximately   million people per year Current United Nations predictions estimate that the world population will reach     billion around   assuming a decrease in average fertility rate from     down to         Almost all growth will take place in the less developed regions where today's     billion population of underdeveloped countries is expected to increase to     billion in   By contrast the population of the more developed regions will remain mostly unchanged at     billion An exception is the United States population which is expected to increase by 44% from   to     In     the average world fertility was     children per woman about half the level in       children per woman In the medium variant global fertility is projected to decline further to     children per woman During     nine countries are expected to account for half of the world's projected population increase India Pakistan   Nigeria Democratic Republic of the Congo Bangladesh Uganda United States Ethiopia and China listed according to the size of their contribution to population growth China would be higher still in this list were it not for its one-child policy Global life expectancy at birth is expected to continue rising from   years in     to   years in     In the more developed regions the projection is to   years by   Among the least developed countries where life expectancy today is just under   years it is expected to increase to   years by     The population of   countries or areas is expected to be lower in   than in   During     the net number of international migrants to more developed regions is projected to be   million Because deaths are projected to exceed births in the more developed regions by   million during     population growth in those regions will largely be due to international migration In     net migration in   countries either prevented population decline or doubled at least the contribution of natural increase births minus deaths to population growth Birth rates are now falling in a small percentage of developing countries while the actual populations in many developed countries would fall without immigration   Urban growth edit Urban areas with at least one million inhabitants in   3% of the world's population lived in cities in   rising to 47% at the end of the twentieth century In   only 3% of the world's population lived in cities By the 20th century's close 47% did so In   there were   cities with populations exceeding one million but by   this had risen to   agglomerations of more than one million   If the trend continues the world's urban population will double every   years according to researchers The UN forecasts that today's urban population of     billion will rise to nearly   billion by   when three out of five people will live in cities   The increase will be most dramatic in the poorest and least-urbanised continents Asia and Africa Projections indicate that most urban growth over the next   years will be in developing countries   One billion people one-seventh of the world's population or one-third of urban population now live in shanty towns   which are seen as \"breeding grounds\" for social problems such as unemployment poverty crime drug addiction alcoholism and other social ills In many poor countries slums exhibit high rates of disease due to unsanitary conditions malnutrition and lack of basic health care   In   there were   megacities conurbations such as Tokyo Beijing Guangzhou Seoul Karachi Mexico City Mumbai S o Paulo London and New York City that have populations in excess of   million inhabitants Greater Tokyo already has   million more than the entire population of Canada at     million   According to the Far Eastern Economic Review Asia alone will have at least   'hypercities' by   that is cities inhabited by more than   million people including Jakarta     million people Dhaka   million Karachi     million Shanghai   million and Mumbai   million   Lagos has grown from     in   to an estimated   million today and the Nigerian government estimates that city will have expanded to   million residents by     Chinese experts forecast that Chinese cities will contain   million people by     Causes edit Street in Kathmandu From a historical perspective technological revolutions have coincided with population expansion There have been three major technological revolutions the tool-making revolution the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution all of which allowed humans more access to food resulting in subsequent population explosions For example the use of tools such as bow and arrow allowed primitive hunters greater access to high energy foods e g animal meat Similarly the transition to farming about     years ago greatly increased the overall food supply which was used to support more people Food production further increased with the industrial revolution as machinery fertilizers herbicides and pesticides were used to increase land under cultivation as well as crop yields Today starvation is caused by economic and political forces rather than a lack of the means to produce food     Significant increases in human population occur whenever the birth rate exceeds the death rate for extended periods of time Traditionally the fertility rate is strongly influenced by cultural and social norms that are rather stable and therefore slow to adapt to changes in the social technological or environmental conditions For example when death rates fell during the 19th and 20th century as a result of improved sanitation child immunizations and other advances in medicine allowing more newborns to survive the fertility rate did not adjust downward resulting in significant population growth Until the 1700s seven out of ten children died before reaching reproductive age   Today more than nine out of ten children born in industrialized nations reach adulthood citation needed There is a strong correlation between overpopulation and poverty   In contrast the invention of the birth control pill and other modern methods of contraception resulted in a dramatic decline in the number of children per household in all but the very poorest countries   Agriculture has sustained human population growth This dates back to prehistoric times when agricultural methods were first developed and continues to the present day with fertilizers agrochemicals large-scale mechanization genetic manipulation and other technologies   Humans have historically exploited the environment using the easiest most accessible resources first The richest farmland was plowed and the richest mineral ore mined first Ceballos Ehrlich and Ehrlich said that overpopulation is demanding the use of ever more creative expensive and/or environmentally destructive means in order to exploit ever more difficult to access and/or poorer quality natural resources to satisfy consumers   Demographic transition edit Main articles Demographic transition and Sub-replacement fertility The theory of demographic transition held that after the standard of living and life expectancy increase family sizes and birth rates decline However as new data has become available it has been observed that after a certain level of development HDI equal to     or higher the fertility increases again   This means that both the worry that the theory generated about aging populations and the complacency it bred regarding the future environmental impact of population growth are misguided Factors cited in the old theory included such social factors as later ages of marriage the growing desire of many women in such settings to seek careers outside child rearing and domestic work and the decreased need for children in industrialized settings The latter factor stems from the fact that children perform a great deal of work in small-scale agricultural societies and work less in industrial ones it has been cited to explain the decline in birth rates in industrializing regions Many countries have high population growth rates but lower total fertility rates because high population growth in the past skewed the age demographic toward a young age so the population still rises as the more numerous younger generation approaches maturity \"Demographic entrapment\" is a concept developed by Maurice King Honorary Research Fellow at the University of Leeds who posits that this phenomenon occurs when a country has a population larger than its carrying capacity no possibility of migration and exports too little to be able to import food This will cause starvation He claims that for example many sub-Saharan nations are or will become stuck in demographic entrapment instead of having a demographic transition   For the world as a whole the number of children born per woman decreased from     to     between   and   A breakdown by region is as follows Europe     to     North America     to     Oceania     to     Central America     to     South America     to     Asia excluding Middle East     to     Middle East & North Africa     to     Sub-Saharan Africa     to     Excluding the observed reversal in fertility decrease for high development the projected world number of children born per woman for   would be around     Only the Middle East & North Africa     and Sub-Saharan Africa     would then have numbers greater than       Carrying capacity edit   Carrying capacity This article appears to contradict the article Carrying capacity Please see discussion on the linked talk page Please do not remove this message until the contradictions are resolved August   A family planning placard in Ethiopia It shows some negative effects of having too many children Some groups for example the World Wide Fund for Nature     and Global Footprint Network have stated that the carrying capacity for the human population has been exceeded as measured using the Ecological Footprint In   WWF 's \" Living Planet Report \" stated that in order for all humans to live with the current consumption patterns of Europeans we would be spending three times more than what the planet can renew   Humanity as a whole was using by     percent more than what Earth can regenerate   However Roger Martin of Population Matters states the view \"the poor want to get rich and I want them to get rich \" with a later addition \"of course we have to change consumption habits but we've also got to stabilise our numbers\"   Another study by the World Wildlife Fund in   found that it would take the equivalent of     Earths of biocapacity to meet humanity's current levels of consumption   But critics question the simplifications and statistical methods used in calculating Ecological Footprints Therefore Global Footprint Network and its partner organizations have engaged with national governments and international agencies to test the results reviews have been produced by France Germany the European Commission Switzerland Luxembourg Japan and the United Arab Emirates   Some point out that a more refined method of assessing Ecological Footprint is to designate sustainable versus non-sustainable categories of consumption     However if yield estimates were adjusted for sustainable levels of production the yield figures would be lower and hence the overshoot estimated by the Ecological Footprint method even higher Other studies give particular attention to resource depletion and increased world affluence further explanation needed     In a   study titled Food Land Population and the U S Economy David Pimentel and Mario Giampietro estimated the maximum U S population for a sustainable economy at   million   And in order to achieve a sustainable economy and avert disaster the United States would have to reduce its population by at least one-third and world population would have to be reduced by two-thirds   Many quantitative studies have estimated the world's carrying capacity for humans that is a limit to the world population   A meta-analysis of   such studies suggests a point estimate of the limit to be     billion people while lower and upper meta-bounds for current technology are estimated as     and   billion people respectively They conclude \"recent predictions of stabilized world population levels for   exceed several of our meta-estimates of a world population limit\"   Effects of human overpopulation edit Further information Overconsumption and Human impact on the environment Some more problems associated with or exacerbated by human overpopulation and over-consumption are Inadequate fresh water   for drinking as well as sewage treatment and effluent discharge Some countries like Saudi Arabia use energy-expensive desalination to solve the problem of water shortages     Depletion of natural resources especially fossil fuels   World energy consumption & predictions     Increased levels of air pollution water pollution soil contamination and noise pollution Changes in atmospheric composition and consequent global warming       Loss of arable land and increase in desertification   Deforestation and desertification can be reversed by adopting property rights and this policy is successful even while the human population continues to grow   Mass species extinctions and contracting biodiversity           from reduced habitat in tropical forests due to slash-and-burn techniques that sometimes are practiced by shifting cultivators especially in countries with rapidly expanding rural populations present extinction rates may be as high as     species lost per year   As of February   the IUCN Red List lists a total of   animal species having gone extinct during recorded human history   although the vast majority of extinctions are thought to be undocumented   Biodiversity would continue to grow at an exponential rate if not for human influence   Sir David King former chief scientific adviser to the UK government told a parliamentary inquiry \"It is self-evident that the massive growth in the human population through the 20th century has had more impact on biodiversity than any other single factor \"     Paul and Anne Ehrlich said population growth is one of the main drivers of the Earth's extinction crisis   The Yangtze River dolphin Atlantic gray whale West African black rhino Merriam's elk California grizzly bear silver trout blue pike and dusky seaside sparrow are all victims of human overpopulation Chris Hedges     High infant and child mortality   High rates of infant mortality are associated with poverty Rich countries with high population densities have low rates of infant mortality   Intensive factory farming to support large populations It results in human threats including the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria diseases excessive air and water pollution and new viruses that infect humans Increased chance of the emergence of new epidemics and pandemics   For many environmental and social reasons including overcrowded living conditions malnutrition and inadequate inaccessible or non-existent health care the poor are more likely to be exposed to infectious diseases   Starvation malnutrition   or poor diet with ill health and diet-deficiency diseases e g rickets However rich countries with high population densities do not have famine   Poverty coupled with inflation in some regions and a resulting low level of capital formation Poverty and inflation are aggravated by bad government and bad economic policies Many countries with high population densities have eliminated absolute poverty and keep their inflation rates very low   Low life expectancy in countries with fastest growing populations   Unhygienic living conditions for many based upon water resource depletion discharge of raw sewage   and solid waste disposal However this problem can be reduced with the adoption of sewers For example after Karachi Pakistan installed sewers its infant mortality rate fell substantially   Elevated crime rate due to drug cartels and increased theft by people stealing resources to survive   Conflict over scarce resources and crowding leading to increased levels of warfare   Less personal freedom and more restrictive laws Laws regulate and shape politics economics history and society and serve as a mediator of relations and interactions between people The higher the population density the more frequent such interactions become and thus there develops a need for more laws and/or more restrictive laws to regulate these interactions and relations It was even speculated by Aldous Huxley in   that democracy is threatened due to overpopulation and could give rise to totalitarian style governments   Many of these problems are explored in the dystopic science fiction film Soylent Green where an overpopulated Earth suffers from food shortages depleted resources and poverty and in the documentary \" Aftermath Population Overload \" David Attenborough described the level of human population on the planet as a multiplier of all other environmental problems   In   he described humanity as \"a plague on the Earth\" that needs to be controlled by limiting population growth   Most biologists and sociologists see overpopulation as a serious threat to the quality of human life     Some deep ecologists such as the radical thinker and polemicist Pentti Linkola see human overpopulation as a threat to the entire biosphere   The effects of overpopulation are compounded by overconsumption According to Paul R Ehrlich Rich western countries are now siphoning up the planet s resources and destroying its ecosystems at an unprecedented rate We want to build highways across the Serengeti to get more rare earth minerals for our cellphones We grab all the fish from the sea wreck the coral reefs and put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere We have triggered a major extinction event A world population of around a billion would have an overall pro-life effect This could be supported for many millennia and sustain many more human lives in the long term compared with our current uncontrolled growth and prospect of sudden collapse If everyone consumed resources at the US level which is what the world aspires to you will need another four or five Earths We are wrecking our planet s life support systems   Some economists such as Thomas Sowell   and Walter E Williams   argue that third world poverty and famine are caused in part by bad government and bad economic policies Resources edit Youth unemployment is also soaring with the economy unable to absorb the spiraling numbers of those seeking to enter the work force Many young people do not have the skills to match the needs of the Egyptian market and the economy is small weak and insufficiently industrialized Instead of being something productive the population growth is a barrel of explosives Ofir Winter an Egypt specialist at the Institute for National Security Studies   Overpopulation does not depend only on the size or density of the population but on the ratio of population to available sustainable resources It also depends on how resources are managed and distributed throughout the population The resources to be considered when evaluating whether an ecological niche is overpopulated include clean water clean air food shelter warmth and other resources necessary to sustain life If the quality of human life is addressed there may be additional resources considered such as medical care education proper sewage treatment waste disposal and energy supplies Overpopulation places competitive stress on the basic life sustaining resources   leading to a diminished quality of life   Directly related to maintaining the health of the human population is water supply and it is one of the resources that experience the biggest strain With the global population at about     billion and each human theoretically needing   liters of drinking water there is a demand for   billion liters of water each day to meet the minimum requirement for healthy living United Weather patterns elevation and climate all contribute to uneven distribution of fresh drinking water Without clean water good health is not a viable option Besides drinking water is used to create sanitary living conditions and is the basis of creating a healthy environment fit to hold human life In addition to drinking water water is also used for bathing washing clothes and dishes flushing toilets a variety of cleaning methods recreation watering lawns and farm irrigation Irrigation poses one of the largest problems because without sufficient water to irrigate crops the crops die and then there is the problem of food rations and starvation In addition to water needed for crops and food there is limited land area dedicated to food production and not much more that is suitable to be added Arable land needed to sustain the growing population is also a factor because land being under or over cultivated easily upsets the delicate balance of nutrition supply There are also problems with location of arable land with regard to proximity to countries and relative population Bashford   Access to nutrition is an important limiting factor in population sustainability and growth No increase in arable land added to the still increasing human population will eventually pose a serious conflict Only 38% of the land area of the globe is dedicated to agriculture and there is not room for much more Although plants produce   billion metric tons of carbohydrates per year when the population is expected to grow to   billion by   the plants may not be able to keep up Biello Food supply is a primary example of how a resource reacts when its carrying capacity is exceeded By trying to grow more and more crops off of the same amount of land the soil becomes exhausted Because the soil is exhausted it is then unable to produce the same amount of food as before and is overall less productive Therefore by using resources beyond a sustainable level the resource become nullified and ineffective which further increases the disparity between the demand for a resource and the availability of a resource There must be a shift to provide adequate recovery time to each one of the supplies in demand to support contemporary human lifestyles       An industrial area with a power plant south of Yangzhou 's downtown China David Pimentel has stated that \"With the imbalance growing between population numbers and vital life sustaining resources humans must actively conserve cropland freshwater energy and biological resources There is a need to develop renewable energy resources Humans everywhere must understand that rapid population growth damages the Earth's resources and diminishes human well-being \"     These reflect the comments also of the United States Geological Survey in their paper The Future of Planet Earth Scientific Challenges in the Coming Century \"As the global population continues to grow people will place greater and greater demands on the resources of our planet including mineral and energy resources open space water and plant and animal resources \" \"Earth's natural wealth an audit\" by New Scientist magazine states that many of the minerals that we use for a variety of products are in danger of running out in the near future   A handful of geologists around the world have calculated the costs of new technologies in terms of the materials they use and the implications of their spreading to the developing world All agree that the planet's booming population and rising standards of living are set to put unprecedented demands on the materials that only Earth itself can provide   Limitations on how much of these materials is available could even mean that some technologies are not worth pursuing long term \"Virgin stocks of several metals appear inadequate to sustain the modern 'developed world' quality of life for all of Earth's people under contemporary technology\"   On the other hand some cornucopian researchers such as Julian L Simon and Bj rn Lomborg believe that resources exist for further population growth In a   study they concluded that \"there are not and will never be too many people for the planet to feed\" according to The Independent   Some critics warn this will be at a high cost to the Earth \"the technological optimists are probably correct in claiming that overall world food production can be increased substantially over the next few decades however the environmental cost of what Paul R and Anne H Ehrlich describe as 'turning the Earth into a giant human feedlot' could be severe A large expansion of agriculture to provide growing populations with improved diets is likely to lead to further deforestation loss of species soil erosion and pollution from pesticides and fertilizer runoff as farming intensifies and new land is brought into production \"   Since we are intimately dependent upon the living systems of the Earth       some scientists have questioned the wisdom of further expansion According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment a four-year research effort by     of the world's prominent scientists commissioned to measure the actual value of natural resources to humans and the world \"The structure of the world's ecosystems changed more rapidly in the second half of the twentieth century than at any time in recorded human history and virtually all of Earth's ecosystems have now been significantly transformed through human actions \"   \"Ecosystem services particularly food production timber and fisheries are important for employment and economic activity Intensive use of ecosystems often produces the greatest short-term advantage but excessive and unsustainable use can lead to losses in the long term A country could cut its forests and deplete its fisheries and this would show only as a positive gain to GDP despite the loss of capital assets If the full economic value of ecosystems were taken into account in decision-making their degradation could be significantly slowed down or even reversed \"     Another study was done by the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP called the Global Environment Outlook Although all resources whether mineral or other are limited on the planet there is a degree of self-correction whenever a scarcity or high-demand for a particular kind is experienced For example in   known reserves of many natural resources were higher and their prices lower than in   despite higher demand and higher consumption Whenever a price spike would occur the market tended to correct itself whether by substituting an equivalent resource or switching to a new technology   Fresh water edit Further information Water crisis Fresh water supplies on which agriculture depends are running low worldwide     This water crisis is only expected to worsen as the population increases   Potential problems with dependence on desalination are reviewed below however the majority of the world's freshwater supply is contained in the polar icecaps and underground river systems accessible through springs and wells Fresh water can be obtained from salt water by desalination For example Malta derives two thirds of its freshwater by desalination A number of nuclear powered desalination plants exist     however the high costs of desalination especially for poor countries make impractical the transport of large amounts of desalinated seawater to interiors of large countries   The cost of desalination varies Israel is now desalinating water for a cost of   cents per cubic meter   Singapore at   cents per cubic meter   In the United States the cost is   cents per cubic meter $3   for     gallons   According to a   study by Zhou and Tol \"one needs to lift the water by   m or transport it over more than   km to get transport costs equal to the desalination costs Desalinated water is expensive in places that are both somewhat far from the sea and somewhat high such as Riyadh and Harare In other places the dominant cost is desalination not transport This leads to somewhat lower costs in places like Beijing Bangkok Zaragoza Phoenix and of course coastal cities like Tripoli \" Thus while the study is generally positive about the technology for affluent areas that are proximate to oceans it concludes that \"Desalinated water may be a solution for some water-stress regions but not for places that are poor deep in the interior of a continent or at high elevation Unfortunately that includes some of the places with biggest water problems \"   \"Another potential problem with desalination is the byproduction of saline brine which can be a major cause of marine pollution when dumped back into the oceans at high temperatures \"   The world's largest desalination plant is the Jebel Ali Desalination Plant Phase   in the United Arab Emirates which can produce   million cubic metres of water per year   or about   gallons per second The largest desalination plant in the US is the one at Tampa Bay Florida which began desalinating   million gallons   m of water per day in December   A   January   article in the Wall Street Journal states \"Worldwide     desalination plants produce more than   billion gallons of water a day according to the International Desalination Association \"   After being desalinated at Jubail Saudi Arabia water is pumped   miles   km inland though a pipeline to the capital city of Riyadh   However new data originating from the GRACE experiments and isotopic testing done by the IAEA show that the Nubian aquifer which is under the largest driest part of the earth's surface has enough water in it to provide for \"at least several centuries\" In addition to this new and highly detailed maps of the earth's underground reservoirs will be soon created from these technologies that will further allow proper budgeting of cheap water   Food edit Some scientists argue that there is enough food to support the world population     and some dispute this particularly if sustainability is taken into account   Many countries rely heavily on imports Egypt and Iran rely on imports for 40% of their grain supply Yemen and Israel import more than 90% And just   countries Argentina Australia Canada France Thailand and the USA supply 90% of grain exports In recent decades the US alone supplied almost half of world grain exports   A   United Nations report says population growth is \"the main force driving increases in agricultural demand\" but \"most recent expert assessments are cautiously optimistic about the ability of global food production to keep up with demand for the foreseeable future that is to say until approximately   or   \" assuming declining population growth rates   However the observed figures for   show an actual increase in absolute numbers of undernourished people in the world   million in   versus   million in     the more recent FAO estimates point to an even more dramatic increase to     billion in     Global perspective edit Further information     world food price crisis Growth in food production has been greater than population growth The amounts of natural resources in this context are not necessarily fixed and their distribution is not necessarily a zero-sum game For example due to the Green Revolution and the fact that more and more land is appropriated each year from wild lands for agricultural purposes the worldwide production of food had steadily increased up until   World food production per person was considerably higher in   than   As world population doubled from   billion to   billion daily calorie consumption in poor countries increased from     to     and the percentage of people in those countries who were malnourished fell from 45% to 18% This suggests that Third World poverty and famine are caused by underdevelopment not overpopulation   However others question these statistics   From   to   as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the world grain production increased by over 250%   The world population has grown by about four billion since the beginning of the Green Revolution and most believe that without the Revolution there would be greater famine and malnutrition than the UN presently documents     The number of people who are overweight has surpassed the number who are undernourished In a   news story MSNBC reported \"There are an estimated   million undernourished people and more than a billion considered overweight worldwide \" The U S has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world   However studies show that wealthy and educated people are far likelier to eat healthy food   indicating obesity is a disease related to poverty and lack of education and excessive advertising of unhealthy eatables at cheaper cost high in calories with little nutritive value are consumed     Percentage of population suffering from malnutrition by country according to United Nations statistics The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations states in its report The State of Food Insecurity in the World   that while the number of undernourished people in the developing countries has declined by about three million a smaller proportion of the populations of developing countries is undernourished today than in     17% against 20% Furthermore FAO's projections suggest that the proportion of hungry people in developing countries could be halved from     levels to 10% by   The FAO also states \"We have emphasized first and foremost that reducing hunger is no longer a question of means in the hands of the global community The world is richer today than it was ten years ago There is more food available and still more could be produced without excessive upward pressure on prices The knowledge and resources to reduce hunger are there What is lacking is sufficient political will to mobilize those resources to the benefit of the hungry \"   As

Bureau in the US reported that the population of Sub-Saharan Africa the poorest region in the continent is rising faster than most of the rest of the world and that \"Rapid population growth makes it

edit Japan may face a food crisis that could reduce daily diets to the austere meals of the 1950s believes a senior government adviser   Population as a function of food availability edit Thinkers from a wide range of academic fields and political backgrounds including agricultural scientist David Pimentel   behavioral scientist Russell Hopfenberg   right-wing anthropologist Virginia Abernethy   ecologist Garrett Hardin   ecologist and anthropologist Peter Farb journalist Richard Manning   environmental biologist Alan D Thornhill   cultural critic and writer Daniel Quinn   and anarcho-primitivist John Zerzan   propose that like all other animal populations human populations predictably grow and shrink according to their available food supply growing during an abundance of food and shrinking in times of scarcity Proponents of this theory argue that every time food production is increased the population grows Most human populations throughout history validate this theory as does the overall current global population Populations of hunter-gatherers fluctuate in accordance with the amount of available food The world human population began increasing after the Neolithic Revolution and its increased food supply This was subsequent to the Green Revolution followed by even more severely accelerated population growth which continues today Often wealthier countries send their surplus food resources to the aid of starving communities however proponents of this theory argue that this seemingly beneficial notion only results in further harm to those communities in the long run Peter Farb for example has commented on the paradox that \"intensification of production to feed an increased population leads to a still greater increase in population \"   Daniel Quinn has also focused on this phenomenon which he calls the \" Food Race \" comparable in terms of both escalation and potential catastrophe to the nuclear arms race Critics of this theory point out that in the modern era birth rates are lowest in the developed nations which also have the highest access to food In fact some developed countries have both a diminishing population and an abundant food supply The United Nations projects that the population of   countries or areas including Germany Italy Japan and most of the states of the former Soviet Union is expected to be lower in   than in   citation needed This shows that limited to the scope of the population living within a single given political boundary particular human populations do not always grow to match the available food supply However the global population as a whole still grows in accordance with the total food supply and many of these wealthier countries are major exporters of food to poorer populations so that \"it is through exports from food-rich to food-poor areas Allaby   Pimentel et al   that the population growth in these food-poor areas is further fueled \"   Regardless of criticisms against the theory that population is a function of food availability the human population is on the global scale undeniably increasing   as is the net quantity of human food produced a pattern that has been true for roughly     years since the human development of agriculture The fact that some affluent countries demonstrate negative population growth fails to discredit the theory as whole since the world has become a globalized system with food moving across national borders from areas of abundance to areas of scarcity Hopfenberg and Pimentel's findings support both this   and Quinn's direct accusation that \"First World farmers are fueling the Third World population explosion \"   Additionally the hypothesis is not so simplistic as to be rejected by any single case study as in Germany's recent population trends clearly other factors are at work to limit the population in wealthier areas contraceptive access educational programs cultural norms and most influentially differing economic realities from nation to nation As a result of water deficits edit Water deficits which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries may soon do the same in larger countries such as China or India if technology is not used   The water tables are falling in scores of countries including Northern China the US and India owing to widespread overdrafting beyond sustainable yields Other countries affected include Pakistan Iran and Mexico This overdrafting is already leading to water scarcity and cutbacks in grain harvest Even with the overpumping of its aquifers China has developed a grain deficit This effect has contributed in driving grain prices upward Most of the   billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing water shortages Desalination is also considered a viable and effective solution to the problem of water shortages     Land edit Percentages of the Earth's surface covered by water dedicated to agriculture under conversion intact and used for human habitation While humans ourselves occupy only   05% of the Earth's total area our effects are felt on over one-quarter of the land The World Resources Institute states that \"Agricultural conversion to croplands and managed pastures has affected some     billion hectares roughly   percent of the land area All totaled agriculture has displaced one-third of temperate and tropical forests and one-quarter of natural grasslands \"     Forty percent of the land area is under conversion and fragmented less than one quarter primarily in the Arctic and the deserts remains intact   Usable land may become less useful through salinization deforestation desertification erosion and urban sprawl Global warming may cause flooding of many of the most productive agricultural areas   The development of energy sources may also require large areas for example the building of hydroelectric dams Thus available useful land may become a limiting factor By most estimates at least half of cultivable land is already being farmed and there are concerns that the remaining reserves are greatly overestimated   High crop yield vegetables like potatoes and lettuce citation needed use less space on inedible plant parts like stalks husks vines and inedible leaves New varieties of selectively bred and hybrid plants have larger edible parts fruit vegetable grain and smaller inedible parts however many of these gain of agricultural technology are now historic and new advances are more difficult to achieve With new technologies it is possible to grow crops on some marginal land under certain conditions Aquaculture could theoretically increase available area Hydroponics and food from bacteria and fungi like quorn may allow the growing of food without having to consider land quality climate or even available sunlight although such a process may be very energy-intensive Some argue that not all arable land will remain productive if used for agriculture because some marginal land can only be made to produce food by unsustainable practices like slash-and-burn agriculture Even with the modern techniques of agriculture the sustainability of production is in question Some countries such as the United Arab Emirates and particularly the Emirate of Dubai have constructed large artificial islands or have created large dam and dike systems like the Netherlands which reclaim land from the sea to increase their total land area     Some scientists have said that in the future densely populated cities will use vertical farming to grow food inside skyscrapers   The notion that space is limited has been decried by skeptics who point out that the Earth's population of roughly     billion people could comfortably be housed an area comparable in size to the state of Texas in the United States about     square miles or       square kilometres   However the impact of humanity extends over a far greater area than that required simply for housing Fossil fuels edit   Peak oil M King Hubbert 's prediction of world petroleum production rates Modern agriculture is totally reliant on petroleum energy Population optimists have been criticized for failing to take into account the depletion of fossil fuels required for the production of fertilizers tillage transportation etc   In his   book Earth in the Balance Al Gore wrote \" it ought to be possible to establish a coordinated global program to accomplish the strategic goal of completely eliminating the internal combustion engine over say a twenty-five-year period \"   Approximately half of the oil produced in the United States is refined into gasoline for use in internal combustion engines   The report Peaking of World Oil Production Impacts Mitigation and Risk Management commonly referred to as the Hirsch report was created by request for the US Department of Energy and published in February     Some information was updated in     It examined the time frame for the occurrence of peak oil the necessary mitigating actions and the likely impacts based on the timeliness of those actions It concludes that world oil peaking is going to happen and will likely be abrupt Initiating a mitigation crash program   years before peaking appears to offer the possibility of avoiding a world liquid fuels shortfall for the forecast period Optimists counter that fossil fuels will be sufficient until the development and implementation of suitable replacement technologies such as nuclear power or various sources of renewable energy occurs   Methods of manufacturing fertilizers from garbage sewage and agricultural waste by using thermal depolymerization have been discovered     With increasing awareness about global warming the question of peak oil has become less relevant According to many studies about 80% of the remaining fossil fuels must be left untouched because the bottleneck has shifted from resource availability to the resource of absorbing the generated greenhouse gases when burning fossil fuels   Wealth and poverty edit Main articles Demographic transition and Income and fertility As the world's population has grown the

t managed to save a single one If only we had put all that money into condoms we might have done some good Sir Peter Scott Founder of the World Wide Fund for Nature   Overpopulation has substantially adversely impacted the environment of Earth starting at least as early as the 20th century   According to the Global Footprint Network \"today humanity uses the equivalent of     planets to provide the resources we use and absorb our waste\"   There are also economic consequences of this environmental degradation in the form of ecosystem services attrition   Beyond the scientifically verifiable harm to the environment some assert the moral right of other species to simply exist rather than become extinct Environmental author Jeremy Rifkin has said that \"our burgeoning population and urban way of life have been purchased at the expense of vast ecosystems and habitats It's no accident that as we celebrate the urbanization of the world we are quickly approaching another historic watershed the disappearance of the wild \"   Says Peter Raven former President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science AAAS in their seminal work AAAS Atlas of Population & Environment \"Where do we stand in our efforts to achieve a sustainable world? Clearly the past half century has been a traumatic one as the collective impact of human numbers affluence consumption per individual and our choices of technology continue to exploit rapidly an increasing proportion of the world's resources at an unsustainable rate During a remarkably short period of time we have lost a quarter of the world's topsoil and a fifth of its agricultural land altered the composition of the atmosphere profoundly and destroyed a major proportion of our forests and other natural habitats without replacing them Worst of all we have driven the rate of biological extinction the permanent loss of species up several hundred times beyond its historical levels and are threatened with the loss of a majority of all species by the end of the 21st century \" Traffic congestion in Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam Further even in countries which have both large population growth and major ecological problems it is not necessarily true that curbing the population growth will make a major contribution towards resolving all environmental problems   However as developing countries with high populations become more industrialized pollution and consumption will invariably increase The Worldwatch Institute said in   that the booming economies of China and India are \"planetary powers that are shaping the global biosphere\" The report states The world's ecological capacity is simply insufficient to satisfy the ambitions of China India Japan Europe and the United States as well as the aspirations of the rest of the world in a sustainable way   According to Worldwatch Institute if China and India were to consume as much resources per capita as the United States in   they would each require a full planet Earth to meet their needs   In the long term these effects can lead to increased conflict over dwindling resources   and in the worst case a Malthusian catastrophe Many studies link population growth with emissions and the effect of climate change     Warfare and conflict edit It has been suggested   that overpopulation leads to increased levels of tensions both between and within countries Modern usage of the term \"lebensraum\" supports the idea that overpopulation may promote warfare through fear of resource scarcity and increasing numbers of youth lacking the opportunity to engage in peaceful employment the youth bulge theory Criticism of this hypothesis edit The hypothesis that population pressure causes increased warfare has been recently criticized on the empirical grounds Both studies focusing on specific historical societies and analyses of cross-cultural data have failed to find positive correlation between population density and incidence of warfare Andrey Korotayev in collaboration with Peter Turchin has shown that such negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis   Population and warfare are dynamical variables and if their interaction causes sustained oscillations then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time that is unlagged Korotayev and Turchin have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare focusing on internal warfare might be in both stateless and state societies Next they have tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies early modern England Han and Tang China and the Roman Empire Their empirical results have supported the population-warfare theory that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in phase with warfare peaks following population peaks Furthermore they have demonstrated that in the agrarian societies the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density       Proposed solutions and mitigation measures edit Given the current levels of violence by this culture against both humans and the natural world however it's not possible to speak of reductions in population and consumption that do not involve violence and privation not because the reductions themselves would necessarily involve violence but because violence and privation have become the default of our culture Derrick Jensen Endgame     Several solutions and mitigation measures have the potential to reduce overpopulation Some solutions are to be applied on a global planetary level e g via UN resolutions while some on a country or state government organization level and some on a family or an individual level Some of the proposed mitigations aim to help implement new social cultural behavioral and political norms to replace or significantly modify current norms For example in societies like China the government has put policies in place that regulate the number of children allowed to a couple Other societies have implemented social marketing strategies in order to educate the public on overpopulation effects \"The intervention can be widespread and done at a low cost A variety of print materials flyers brochures fact sheets stickers needs to be produced and distributed throughout the communities such as at local places of worship sporting events local food markets schools and at car parks taxis / bus stands \"   Such prompts work to introduce the problem so that new or modified social norms are easier to implement Certain government policies are making it easier and more socially acceptable to use contraception and abortion methods An example of a country whose laws and norms are hindering the global effort to slow population growth is Afghanistan \"The approval by Afghan President Hamid Karzai of the Shia Personal Status Law in March   effectively destroyed Shia women's rights and freedoms in Afghanistan Under this law women have no right to deny their husbands sex unless they are ill and can be denied food if they do \"   Scientists and technologists including e g Huesemann Huesemann Ehrlich and Ehrlich caution that science and technology as currently practiced cannot solve the serious problems global human society faces and that a cultural-social-political shift is needed to reorient science and technology in a more socially responsible and environmentally sustainable direction     Reducing overpopulation edit   Human population planning Education and empowerment edit One option is to focus on education about overpopulation family planning and birth control methods and to make birth-control devices like male and female condoms contraceptive pills and intrauterine devices easily available Worldwide nearly 40% of pregnancies are unintended some   million unintended pregnancies each year   An estimated   million women in the poorest countries of the world either did not want their last child do not want another child or want to space their pregnancies but they lack access to information affordable means and services to determine the size and spacing of their families In the United States in   almost half of pregnancies were unintended   In the developing world some     women die annually of complications from pregnancy and abortion   with 86% of these deaths occurring in the sub-Saharan Africa region and South Asia   Additionally   million infants die many because of malnutrition or preventable diseases especially from lack of access to clean drinking water   Women's rights and their reproductive rights in particular are issues regarded to have vital importance in the debate   \"The only ray of hope I can see and it's not much is that wherever women are put in control of their lives both politically and socially where medical facilities allow them to deal with birth control and where their husbands allow them to make those decisions birth rate falls Women don't want to have   kids of whom nine will die \" David Attenborough   Egypt announced a program to reduce its overpopulation by family planning education and putting women in the workforce It was announced in June   by the Minister of Health and Population and the government has set aside   million Egyptian pounds about $90 million US for the program   Several scientists including e g Paul and Anne Ehrlich and Gretchen Daily proposed that humanity should work at stabilizing its absolute numbers as a starting point towards beginning the process of reducing the total numbers They suggested the following solutions and policies following a small-family-size socio-cultural-behavioral norm worldwide especially one-child-per-family ethos and providing contraception to all along with proper education on its use and benefits while providing access to safe legal abortion as a backup to contraception combined with a significantly more equitable distribution of resources globally     Business magnate Ted Turner proposed a \"voluntary non-imposed\" one-child-per-family cultural norm A \" pledge two or fewer \" campaign is run by Population Matters a UK population concern organisation in which people are encouraged to limit themselves to small family size Population planning that is intended to reduce population size or growth rate may promote or enforce one or more of the following practices although there are other methods as well Greater and better access to contraception Reducing infant mortality so that parents do not need to have many children to ensure at least some survive to adulthood   Improving the status of women in order to facilitate a departure from traditional sexual division of labour One-Child and Two-Child policies and other policies restricting or discouraging births directly Family planning   Creating small family \"role models\"   Tighter immigration restrictions The method s chosen can be strongly influenced by the cultural and religious beliefs of community members Birth regulations edit Overpopulation can be mitigated by birth control some nations like the People's Republic of China use strict measures to reduce birth rates Religious and ideological opposition to birth control has been cited as a factor contributing to overpopulation and poverty   Sanjay Gandhi son of late Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi implemented a forced sterilization programme between   and   Officially men with two children or more had to submit to sterilization but there was a greater focus on sterilizing women than sterilizing men Some unmarried young men and political opponents may also have been sterilized citation needed This program is still remembered and criticized in India and is blamed for creating a public aversion to family planning which hampered government programs for decades   Urban designer Michael E Arth has proposed a \"choice-based marketable birth license plan\" he calls \" birth credits \"   Birth credits would allow any woman to have as many children as she wants as long as she buys a license for any children beyond an average allotment that would result in zero population growth If that allotment was determined to be one child for example then the first child would be free and the market would determine what the license fee for each additional child would cost Extra credits would expire after a certain time so these credits could not be hoarded by speculators The actual cost of the credits would only be a fraction of the actual cost of having and raising a child so the credits would serve more as a wake-up call to women who might otherwise produce children without seriously considering the long term consequences to themselves or society   Another choice-based approach similar to Arth's birth credits is financial compensation or other benefits free goods and/or services by the state or state-owned companies offered to people who voluntarily undergo sterilization Such compensation has been offered in the past by the government of India   In   the United Nations estimated there is an 80% likelihood that the world's population will be between     billion and     billion by   Most of the world's expected population increase will be in Africa and southern Asia Africa's population is expected to rise from the current one billion to four billion by   and Asia could add another billion in the same period   Because the median age of Africans is relatively low e g in Uganda it is   years old birth credits would have to limit fertility to one child per two women to reach the levels of developed countries immediately For countries with a wide base in their population pyramid it will take a generation for the people who are of child bearing age to have their families   An example of demographic momentum is China which added perhaps     more people after its one-child policy was enacted Arth has suggested that the focus should be on the developed countries and that some combination of birth credits and additional compensation supplied by the developed countries could rapidly lead to zero population growth while also quickly raising the standard of living in developing countries   Extraterrestrial settlement edit   Space colonization   Space advocacy and Steady-state economy Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space Various scientists and science fiction authors have contemplated that overpopulation on Earth may be remedied in the future by the use of extraterrestrial settlements In the 1970s Gerard K O'Neill suggested building space habitats that could support     times the carrying capacity of Earth using just the asteroid belt and that the Solar System as a whole could sustain current population growth rates for a thousand years   Marshall Savage     has projected a human population of five quintillion   x     throughout the Solar System by   with the majority in the asteroid belt   Freeman Dyson   favours the Kuiper belt as the future home of humanity suggesting this could happen within a few centuries   In Mining the Sky John S Lewis suggests that the resources of the solar system could support   quadrillion     people In an interview Stephen Hawking claimed that overpopulation is a threat to human existence and \"our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward looking on planet Earth but to spread out into space \"   K Eric Drexler famous inventor of the futuristic concept of molecular nanotechnology has suggested in Engines of Creation that colonizing space will mean breaking the Malthusian limits to growth for the human species It may be possible for other parts of the Solar System to be inhabited by humanity at some point in the future Geoffrey Landis of NASA 's Glenn Research Center in particular has pointed out that \" at cloud-top level Venus is the paradise planet\" as one could construct aerostat habitats and floating cities there easily based on the concept that breathable air is a lifting gas in the dense Venusian atmosphere Venus would like also Saturn Uranus and Neptune in the upper layers of their atmospheres even afford a gravitation almost exactly as strong as that on Earth see colonization of Venus   Many science fiction authors including Carl Sagan Arthur C Clarke   and Isaac Asimov   have argued that shipping any excess population into space is not a viable solution to human overpopulation According to Clarke \"the population battle must be fought or won here on Earth\"   The problem for these authors is not the lack of resources in space as shown in books such as Mining the Sky   but the physical impracticality of shipping vast numbers of people into space to \"solve\" overpopulation on Earth However Gerard K O'Neill 's calculations show that Earth could offload all new population growth with a launch services industry about the same size as the current airline industry   The StarTram concept by James R Powell the co-inventor of maglev transport and others envisions a capability to send up to   million people a decade to space per facility   A hypothetical extraterrestrial colony could potentially grow by reproduction only i e without any immigration with all of the inhabitants being the direct descendants of the original colonists Urbanization edit Despite the increase in population density within cities and the emergence of megacities UN Habitat states in its reports that urbanization may be the best compromise in the face of global population growth   Cities concentrate human activity within limited areas limiting the breadth of environmental damage   But this mitigating influence can only be achieved if urban planning is significantly improved   and city services are properly maintained And it does not solve the problem of feeding an ever-growing urban population since arable lands are limited and since yields are already at a maximum with industrial agriculture using much energy fertilizers and pesticides moreover - with much environmental damage Graph gallery edit Afghanistan shows a classic youth bulge Angola shows the same even more pronounced China had an extreme youth bulge until the

mindset toward innovation that runs counter to the secrecy and silo mentality of traditional corporate research labs The benefits and driving forces behind increased openness have been noted and discussed as far back as the 1960s especially as it pertains to interfirm cooperation in R&D   Use of the term 'open innovation' in reference to the increasing embrace of external cooperation in a complex world has been promoted in particular by Henry Chesbrough adjunct professor and faculty director of the Center for Open Innovation of the Haas School of Business at the University of California   who articulated a modern perspective in his book Open Innovation The new imperative for creating and profiting from technology     The term was originally referred to as \"a paradigm that assumes that firms can and should use external ideas as well as internal ideas and internal and external paths to market as the firms look to advance their technology\"   More recently it is defined as \"a distributed innovation process based on purposively managed knowledge flows across organizational boundaries using pecuniary and non-pecuniary mechanisms in line with the organization's business model\"   This more recent definition acknowledges that open innovation is not solely firm-centric it also includes creative consumers   and communities of user innovators   The boundaries between a firm and its environment have become more permeable innovations can easily transfer inward and outward between firms and other firms and between firms and creative consumers resulting in impacts at the level of the consumer the firm an industry and society   The central idea behind open innovation is that in a world of widely distributed knowledge companies cannot afford to rely entirely on their own research but should instead buy or license processes or inventions i e patents from other companies In addition internal inventions not being used in a firm's business should be taken outside the company e g through licensing joint ventures or spin-offs   The open innovation paradigm can be interpreted to go beyond just using external sources of innovation such as customers rival companies and academic institutions and can be as much a change in the use management and employment of intellectual property as it is in the technical and research driven generation of intellectual property In this sense it is understood as the systematic encouragement and exploration of a wide range of internal and external sources for innovative opportunities the integration of this exploration with firm capabilities and resources and the exploitation of these opportunities through multiple channels   Contents   Advantages   Disadvantages   Models     Government Driven

of global collaboration Reduced cost of conducting research and development Potential for improvement in development productivity Incorporation of customers early in the development process Increase in accuracy for market research and customer targeting Potential for synergism between internal and external innovations Potential for viral marketing   Disadvantages edit Implementing a model of open innovation is naturally associated with a number of risks and challenges including Possibility of revealing information not intended for sharing Potential for the hosting organization to lose their competitive advantage as a consequence of revealing intellectual property Increased complexity of controlling innovation and regulating how contributors affect a project Devising a means to properly identify and incorporate external innovation Realigning innovation strategies to extend beyond the firm in order to maximize the return from external innovation     Models edit Government Driven edit In the UK the Knowledge Transfer Partnerships KTP is a funding mechanism encouraging the partnership between a firm and a knowledge-based partner   A KTP is a collaboration program between a knowledge-based partner i e a research institution a company partner and one or more associates i e recently qualified persons such as graduates KTP initiatives aim to deliver significant improvement in business partners profitability as a direct result of the partnership through enhanced quality and operations increased sales and access to new markets At the end of their KTP project the three actors involved have to prepare a final report that describes KTP initiative supported the achievement of the project s innovation goals   Product platforming edit This approach involves developing and introducing a partially completed product for the purpose of providing a framework or tool-kit for contributors to access customize and exploit The goal is for the contributors to extend the platform product's functionality while increasing the overall value of the product for everyone involved Readily available software frameworks such as a software development kit SDK or an application programming interface API are common examples of product platforms This approach is common in markets with strong network effects where demand for the product implementing the framework such as a mobile phone or an online application increases with the number of developers that are attracted to use the platform tool-kit The high scalability of platforming often results in an increased complexity of administration and quality assurance   Idea competitions edit This model entails implementing a system that encourages competitiveness among contributors by rewarding successful submissions Developer competitions such as hackathon events fall under this category of open innovation This method provides organizations with inexpensive access to a large quantity of innovative ideas while also providing a deeper insight into the needs of their customers and contributors   Customer immersion edit While mostly oriented toward the end of the product development cycle this technique involves extensive customer interaction through employees of the host organization Companies are thus able to accurately incorporate customer input while also allowing them to be more closely involved in the design process and product management cycle   Collaborative product design and development edit Similarly to product platforming an organization incorporates their contributors into the development of the product This differs from platforming in the sense that in addition to the provision of the framework on which contributors develop the hosting organization still controls and maintains the eventual products developed in collaboration with their contributors This method gives organizations more control by ensuring that the correct product is developed as fast as possible while reducing the overall cost of development   Dr Henry Chesbrough recently supported this model for open innovation in the optics and photonics industry   Innovation networks edit Similarly to idea competitions an organization leverages a network of contributors in the design process by offering a reward in the form of an incentive The difference relates to the fact that the network of contributors are used to develop solutions to identified problems within the development process as opposed to new products   Emphasis needs to be placed on assessing organisational capabilities to ensure value creation in open innovation     In science edit In Austria the Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft started a project named \" Tell us! \" about mental health issues and used the concept of open innovation to crowdsource research questions     The institute also launched the first \" Lab for Open Innovation in Science \" to teach   selected scientists the concept of open innovation over the course of one year On Facebook the Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft informs about the lab the participants and teachers and on news on open innovation in science Versus closed innovation edit The paradigm of closed innovation holds that successful innovation requires control Particularly a company should control the generation of their own ideas as well as production marketing distribution servicing financing and supporting What drove this idea is that in the early twentieth century academic and government institutions were not involved in the commercial application of science As a result it was left up to other corporations to take the new product development cycle into their own hands There just was not the time to wait for the scientific community to become more involved in the practical application of science There also was not enough time to wait for other companies to start producing some of the components that were required in their final product These companies became relatively self-sufficient with little communication directed outwards to other companies or universities Throughout the years several factors emerged that paved the way for open innovation paradigms The increasing availability and mobility of skilled workers The growth of the venture capital market External options for ideas sitting on the shelf The increasing capability of external suppliers These four factors have resulted in a new market of knowledge Knowledge is not anymore proprietary to the company It resides in employees suppliers customers competitors and universities If companies do not use the knowledge they have inside someone else will Innovation can be generated either by means of closed innovation or by open innovation paradigms     There is an ongoing debate on which paradigm will dominate in the future Open innovation tools edit According to a case study conducted by Sony Mobile a stable and flexible way to realize open innovation is by using a tool that is dedicated for said purpose   One key reason other than commits from communities regards the possibility of tailoring the tool to internal needs Such tools can be

innovation disruptive innovation or social innovation Management of innovation however plays a significant role in promoting technological and institutional innovation The goal of innovation management within a company is to cultivate a suitable environment to encourage innovation   The suitable environment would help the firms get more cooperation projects even the take-off platform for business ventures     Senior management's support is crucial to successful innovation clear direction endorsement and support are essential to innovation pursuits   Managing complex innovation edit Innovation is often a technological change that outperforms a previous practice To lead or sustain with innovations managers need to concentrate heavily on the innovation network which requires deep understanding of the complexity of innovation Collaboration is an important source of innovation Innovations are increasingly brought to the market by networks of firms selected according to their comparative advantages and operating in a coordinated manner When a technology goes through a major transformation phase and yields a successful innovation it becomes a great learning experience not only for the parent industry but other industries as well Big innovations are generally the outcome of intra- and interdisciplinary networking among technological sectors along with combination of implicit and explicit knowledge Networking is required but network integration is the key to success for complex innovation Social economic zones technology corridors free trade agreements and technology clusters are some of the ways to encourage organizational networking and cross-functional innovations Innovation management tools edit Antonio Hidalgo and Jose Albor proposed the use of typologies as an innovation management tool   The study conducted at a European level used   typologies for knowledge-driven Innovation Management Tools These typologies were found by looking at   characteristics   that classify Innovation Management Tools Hidalgo and Albors were able to narrow the list down to   criteria knowledge-driven focus strategic impact degree of availability level of documentation practical usefulness age of the IMT required resources for implementation measurability that are especially relevant for IMTs in the knowledge-driven economy knowledge economy The advantage of using typologies is the easy integration of new methods and the availability of a broader scope of tools Innovation management tool comparison edit Below is a comparison of various

v t e The legal term public domain refers to works whose exclusive intellectual property rights have expired   have been forfeited   have been expressly waived or are inapplicable   For example the works of Shakespeare and Beethoven and most early silent films are in the public domain either by virtue of their having been created before copyright existed or by their copyright term having expired   Some works are not covered by copyright and are therefore in the public domain among them the formulae of Newtonian physics cooking recipes   and all computer software created prior to     Other works are actively dedicated by their authors to the public domain see waiver some examples include reference implementations of cryptographic algorithms       the image-processing software ImageJ   created by the National Institutes of Health and the CIA 's World Factbook   The term public domain is not normally applied to situations where the creator of a work retains residual rights in which case use of the work is referred to as \"under license\" or \"with permission\" As rights vary by country and jurisdiction a work may be subject to rights in one country and be in the public domain in another Some rights depend on registrations on a country-by-country basis and the absence of registration in a particular country if required gives rise to public-domain status for a work in that country The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise or undefined terms such as the \" public sphere \" or \" commons \" including concepts such as the \"commons of the mind\" the \"intellectual commons\" and the \"information commons\"   Contents   History   Definition   Public domain by medium     Public-domain books     Public-domain music     Public-domain films

History edit Although the term \"domain\" did not come into use until the mid-18th century the concept \"can be traced back to the ancient Roman Law as a preset system included in the property right system \"   The Romans had a large proprietary rights system where they defined \"many things that cannot be privately owned\"   as res nullius res communes res publicae and res universitatis The term res nullius was defined as things not yet appropriated   The term res communes was defined as \"things that could be commonly enjoyed by mankind such as air sunlight and ocean \"   The term res publicae referred to things that were shared by all citizens and the term res universitatis meant things that were owned by the municipalities of Rome   When looking at it from a historical perspective one could say the construction of the idea of \"public domain\" sprouted from the concepts of res communes res publicae and res universitatis in early Roman law   When the first early copyright law was first established in Britain with the Statute of Anne in   public domain did not appear However similar concepts were developed by British and French jurists in the 18th century Instead of \"\" they used terms such as publici juris or propri t publique to describe works that were not covered by copyright law   The phrase \"fall in the public domain\" can be traced to mid-19th century France to describe the end of copyright term The French poet Alfred de Vigny equated the expiration of copyright with a work falling \"into the sink hole of public domain\"   and if the public domain receives any attention from intellectual property lawyers it is still treated as little more than that which is left when intellectual property rights such as copyright patents and expire or are abandoned   In this historical context Paul Torremans describes copyright as a \"little coral reef of private right jutting up from the ocean of the public domain \"   Copyright law differs by country and the American legal scholar Pamela Samuelson has described the public domain as being \"different sizes at different times in different countries\"   Definition edit Newton's own copy of his Principia with hand-written corrections for the second edition Definitions of the boundaries of the public domain in relation to copyright or intellectual property more generally regard the public domain as a negative space that is it consists of works that are no longer in copyright term or were never protected by copyright law   According to James Boyle this definition underlines common usage of the term public domain and equates the public domain to public property and works in copyright to private property However the usage of the term public domain can be more granular including for example uses of works in copyright permitted by copyright exceptions Such a definition regards work in copyright as private property subject to fair-use rights and limitation on ownership   A conceptual definition comes from Lange who focused on what the public domain should be \"it should be a place of sanctuary for individual creative expression a sanctuary conferring affirmative protection against the forces of private appropriation that threatened such expression\"   Patterson and Lindberg described the public domain not as a \"territory\" but rather as a concept \" T here are certain materials the air we breathe sunlight rain space life creations thoughts feelings ideas words numbers not subject to private ownership The materials that compose our cultural heritage must be free for all living to use no less than matter necessary for biological survival \"   The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise or undefined terms such as the \" public sphere \" or \" commons \" including concepts such as the \"commons of the mind\" the \"intellectual commons\" and the \"information commons\"   Public domain by medium edit This article needs additional citations for verification Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources Unsourced material may be challenged and removed April   Learn how and when to remove this template message Public-domain books edit A public-domain book is a book with no copyright a book that was created without a license or a book where its copyrights expired   or have been forfeited   Every book and tale written prior to   or   in some countries is in the public domain among them every book written by Jane Austen Lewis Carroll Edgar Allan Poe and H G Wells citation needed Public-domain music edit   Public domain music Music has been created and played by humans for millennia An object identified as a possible flute the Divje Babe Flute is more than     years old Even if humans had musical instruments and made music there was a need for a musical notation system to be able to preserve song through writing The first such system the Music of Mesopotamia notation system was created   years ago In the 10th century Guido of Arezzo introduced Latin musical notations citation needed All this laid the foundation for the preservation of global music belonging to the public domain since the beginning of musical history to the present The Musopen project records music in the public domain for the purposes of making the music available to the general public in a high-quality audio format Online musical archives preserve collections of classical music recorded by Museopen and offer them for download/distribution as a public service Play media Rock Rock Rock a film from   Public-domain films edit   Public domain film A public-domain film is a film that was released to public domain by its author or because its copyright has expired In   there are more than     films on public domain in every genre from musicals to romance horror to animated movies and noir to western movies citation needed Value edit Pamela Samuelson has identified eight \"values\" that can arise from information and works in the public domain     Possible values include Building blocks for the creation of new knowledge examples include data facts ideas theories and scientific principle Access to cultural heritage through information resources such as ancient Greek texts and Mozart's symphonies Promoting education through the spread of information ideas and scientific principles Enabling follow-on innovation through for example expired patents and copyright Enabling low cost access to information without the need to locate the owner or negotiate rights clearance and pay royalties through for example expired copyrighted works or patents and non-original data compilation   Promoting public health and safety through information and scientific principles Promoting the democratic process and values through news laws regulation and judicial opinion Enabling competitive imitation through for example expired patents and copyright or publicly disclosed technologies that do not qualify for patent protection     Relationship with derivative works edit   Derivative work L H O O Q   Derivative work by the Dadaist Marcel Duchamp based on the Mona Lisa Derivative works include translations musical arrangements and dramatizations of a work as well as other forms of transformation or adaptation   Copyrighted works may not be used for derivative works without permission from the copyright owner   while public domain works can be freely used for derivative works without permission     Artworks that are public domain may also be reproduced photographically or artistically or used as the basis of new interpretive works   Works derived from public domain works can be copyrighted   Once works enter into the public domain derivative works such as adaptations in book and film may increase noticeably as happened with Frances Hodgson Burnett 's novel The Secret Garden which became public domain in     By   the plays of Shakespeare all public domain had been used in more than   feature-length films   In addition to straightforward adaptation they have been used as the launching point for transformative retellings such as Tom Stoppard 's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead and Troma Entertainment 's Romeo and Juliet       Marcel Duchamp's L H O O Q is a derivative of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa one of thousands of derivative works based on the public domain painting   Perpetual copyright edit   Perpetual copyright Some works may never fully lapse into the public domain A perpetual crown copyright is held for the Authorized King James Version of the Bible in the UK   While the copyright of the Peter Pan works by J M Barrie the play Peter Pan or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up and the novel Peter and Wendy has expired in the United Kingdom it was granted a special exception under the Copyright Designs and Patents Act   Schedule     that requires royalties to be paid for commercial performances publications and broadcasts of the story of Peter Pan within the UK as long as Great Ormond Street Hospital to whom Barrie gave the copyright continues to exist Public domain mark edit Creative Commons ' Public Domain Mark The Creative Commons proposed in   the Public Domain Mark PDM as symbol to indicate that a work is free of known copyright restrictions and therefore in the public domain     The public domain mark is analogous to the copyright symbol which acts as copyright notice The Europeana databases use it and for instance on the Wikimedia Commons in February       million works ~10% of all works are listed as PDM   Application to copyrightable works edit Works not covered by copyright law edit The underlying idea that is expressed or manifested in the creation of a work generally cannot be the subject of copyright law see idea expression divide Mathematical formulae will therefore generally form part of the public domain to the extent that their expression in the form of software is not covered by copyright Works created before the existence of copyright and patent laws also form part of the public domain For example the Bible and the inventions of Archimedes are in the public domain but copyright may exist in translations or new formulations or digitized editions of these works so for example most translations of the Bible into foreign languages and the digital editions of these are copyrighted Expiry of copyright edit Determination of whether a copyright has expired depends on an examination of the copyright in its source country In the United States determining whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright can be quite complex primarily because copyright terms have been extended multiple times and in different ways shifting over the course of the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication with a possible renewal term to a term extending to   then   years after the death of the author The claim that \"pre-1923 works are in the public domain\" is correct only for published works unpublished works are under federal copyright for at least the life of the author plus   years In most other countries that are signatories to the Berne Convention copyright term is based on the life of the author and extends to   or   years beyond the death of the author See List of countries' copyright lengths Legal traditions differ on whether a work in the public domain can have its copyright restored In the European Union the Copyright Duration Directive was applied retroactively restoring and extending the terms of copyright on material previously in the public domain Term extensions by the U S and Australia generally have not removed works from the public domain but rather delayed the addition of works to it However the United States moved away from that tradition with the Uruguay Round Agreements Act which removed from the public domain many foreign-sourced works that had previously not been in copyright in the US for failure to comply with US-based formalities requirements Consequently in the US foreign-sourced works and US-sourced works are now treated differently with foreign-sourced works remaining under copyright regardless of compliance with formalities while domestically-sourced works may be in the public domain if they failed to comply with then-existing formalities requirements a situation described as odd by some scholars and unfair by some US-based rightsholders   Government works edit Works of the United States Government and various other governments are excluded from copyright law and may therefore be considered to be in the public domain in their respective countries   They may also be in the public domain in other countries as well The legal scholar Melville Nimmer has written that \"it is axiomatic that material in the public domain is not protected by copyright even when incorporated into a copyrighted work\"   Dedicating works to the public domain edit Release without copyright notice edit Before   in the US works could be easily given into the public domain by just releasing it without an explicit Copyright notice With the Berne Convention Implementation Act of   and the earlier Copyright Act of   which went into effect in   all works were by default copyright protected and needed to be actively given into public domain by a waiver statement/ anti-copyright can call notice     Not all legal systems have processes for reliably donating works to the public domain e g civil law of continental Europe citation needed This may even \"effectively prohibit any attempt by copyright owners to surrender rights automatically conferred by law particularly moral rights \"   Public domain like licenses edit   Public domain equivalent license An alternative is for copyright holders to issue a licence which irrevocably grants as many rights as possible to the general public Real public domain makes licenses unnecessary as no owner/author is required to grant permission \" Permission culture \" There are multiple licenses which aim to release works into the public domain In   the WTFPL was released as a public domain like software license   In   the Creative commons released the CC0 which was created for compatibility with law domains which have no concept of dedicating into public domain This is achieved by a public domain waiver statement and a fall-back all-permissive license in case the waiver is not possible     The Unlicense published around   has a focus on an Anti-copyright message The Unlicense offers a public domain waiver text with a fall-back public domain-like license inspired by permissive licenses but without attribution     In October   the Open Knowledge Foundation recommends the Creative Commons CC0 license to dedicate content to the public domain     and the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License PDDL for data   Patents edit   Term of patent In most countries the term of rights for patents is   years after which the invention becomes part of the public domain In the United States the contents of patents are considered valid and enforceable for   years from the date of filing within the United States or   years from the earliest date of filing if under   USC     or   c   However the text and any illustration within a patent provided the illustrations are essentially line drawings and do not in any substantive way reflect the \"personality\" of the person drawing them are not subject to copyright protection   This is separate from the patent rights just mentioned Trademarks edit A trademark registration may remain in force indefinitely or expire without specific regard to its age For a trademark registration to remain valid the owner must continue to use it In some circumstances such as disuse failure to assert trademark rights or common usage by the public without regard for its intended use it could become generic and therefore part of the public domain Because trademarks are registered with governments some countries or trademark registries may recognize a mark while others may have determined that it is generic and not allowable as a trademark in that registry For example the drug \"acetylsalicylic acid\" 2-acetoxybenzoic acid is better known as aspirin in the United States a generic term In Canada however \"Aspirin\" with an uppercase A is still a trademark of the German company Bayer while aspirin with a lowercase \"a\" is not Bayer lost the trademark in the United States the UK and France after World War I as part of the Treaty of Versailles So many copycat products entered the marketplace during the war that it was deemed generic just three years later   Bayer also lost the trademark in the same jurisdictions for \"Heroin\" which it trademarked a year before it trademarked Aspirin citation needed Although Hormel resigned itself to genericide   it has fought attempts by other companies to register \" spam \" as a trademark in relation to computer products   Public Domain Day edit   Public Domain Day An English logo of the 2015/2016 Public Domain Day in Poland Public Domain Day is an observance of when copyrights expire and works enter into the public domain   This legal transition of copyright works into the public domain usually happens every year on   January based on the individual copyright laws of each country   The observance of a \"Public Domain Day\" was initially informal the earliest known mention was in   by Wallace McLean a Canadian public domain activist   with support for the idea echoed by Lawrence Lessig   As of   January   update a Public Domain Day website lists the authors whose works are entering the public domain   There are activities in

breakthrough Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field An inventor may be taking a big step in success or failure Some inventions can be patented A patent legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary from country to country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive Another meaning of invention is cultural invention which is an innovative set of useful social behaviours adopted by people and passed on to others   The Institute for Social Inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and books   Invention is also an important component of artistic and design creativity Inventions

or cultural Scientific-technological inventions include railroads aviation vaccination hybridization antibiotics astronautics holography the atomic bomb computing the Internet and the smartphone Sociopolitical inventions comprise new laws institutions and procedures that change modes of social behavior and establish new forms of human interaction and organization Examples include the British Parliament the US Constitution the Manchester UK General Union of Trades the Boy Scouts the Red Cross the Olympic Games the United Nations the European Union and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as movements such as socialism Zionism suffragism feminism and animal-rights veganism Humanistic inventions encompass culture in its entirety and are as transformative and important as any in the sciences although people tend to take them for granted In the domain of linguistics for example many alphabets have been inventions as are all neologisms Shakespeare invented about     words Literary inventions include the epic tragedy comedy the novel the sonnet the Renaissance neoclassicism Romanticism Symbolism Aestheticism Socialist Realism Surrealism postmodernism and according to Freud psychoanalysis Among the inventions of artists and musicians are oil painting printmaking photography cinema musical tonality atonality jazz rock opera and the symphony orchestra Philosophers have invented logic several times dialectics idealism materialism utopia anarchism semiotics phenomenology behaviorism positivism pragmatism and deconstruction Religious thinkers are responsible for such inventions as monotheism pantheism Methodism Mormonism iconoclasm puritanism deism secularism ecumenism and Baha i Some of these disciplines genres and trends may seem to have existed eternally or to have emerged spontaneously of their own accord but most of them have had inventors   Process of invention Practical means of invention Alessandro Volta with the first electrical battery Volta is recognized as one of the most influential inventors of all time Idea for an Invention may be developed on paper or on a computer by writing or drawing by trial and error by making models by experimenting by testing and/or by making the invention in its whole form Brainstorming also can spark new ideas for an invention Collaborative creative processes are frequently used by engineers designers architects and scientists Co-inventors are frequently named on patents In addition many inventors keep records of their working process - notebooks photos etc including Leonardo da Vinci Galileo Galilei Evangelista Torricelli Thomas Jefferson and Albert Einstein         In the process of developing an invention the initial idea may change The invention may become simpler more practical it may expand or it may even morph into something totally different Working on one invention can lead to others too   History shows that turning the concept of an invention into a working device is not always swift or direct Inventions may also become more useful after time passes and other changes occur For example the parachute became more useful once powered flight was a reality   Conceptual means Thomas Edison with phonograph Edison was one of the most prolific inventors in history holding     U S patents in his name Invention is often a creative process An open and curious mind allows an inventor to see beyond what is known Seeing a new possibility connection or relationship can spark an invention Inventive thinking frequently involves combining concepts or elements from different realms that would not normally be put together Sometimes inventors disregard the boundaries between distinctly separate territories or fields citation needed Several concepts may be considered when thinking about invention Play Play may lead to invention Childhood curiosity experimentation and imagination can develop one's play instinct Inventors feel the need to play with things that interest them and to explore and this internal drive brings about novel creations     Sometimes inventions and ideas may seem to arise spontaneously while daydreaming especially when the mind is free from its usual concerns   For example both J K Rowling the creator of Harry Potter   and Frank Hornby the inventor of Meccano   first had their ideas while on train journeys In contrast the successful aerospace engineer Max Munk advocated \"aimful thinking\"   Re-envision To invent is to see anew Inventors often envision a new idea seeing it in their mind's eye New ideas can arise when the conscious mind turns away from the subject or problem when the inventor's focus is on something else or while relaxing or sleeping A novel idea may come in a flash a Eureka ! moment For example after years of working to figure out the general theory of relativity the solution came to Einstein suddenly in a dream \"like a giant die making an indelible impress a huge map of the universe outlined itself in one clear vision\"   Inventions can also be accidental such as in the case of polytetrafluoroethylene Teflon Insight Insight can also be a vital element of invention Such inventive insight may begin with questions doubt or a hunch It may begin by recognizing that something unusual or accidental may be useful or that it could open a new avenue for exploration For example the odd metallic color of plastic made by accidentally adding a thousand times too much catalyst led scientists to explore its metal-like properties inventing electrically conductive plastic and light emitting plastic- an invention that won the Nobel Prize in   and has led to innovative lighting display screens wallpaper and much more see conductive polymer and organic light-emitting diode or OLED   Exploration A rare   photo showing the experimental recording of voice patterns by a photographic process at the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory in Washington D C Many of their experimental designs panned out in failure Invention is often an exploratory process with an uncertain or unknown outcome There are failures as well as successes Inspiration can start the process but no matter how complete the initial idea inventions typically must be developed Improvement Inventors may for example try to improve something by making it more effective healthier faster more efficient easier to use serve more purposes longer lasting cheaper more ecologically friendly or aesthetically different lighter weight more ergonomic structurally different with new light or color properties etc Implementing Inventions Western Hindu Arabic numerals - an example of non-material inventions Railways probably the most important invention in land transport Railway station in Bratislava Slovakia In economic theory inventions are one of the chief examples of \" positive externalities \" a beneficial side-effect that falls on those outside a transaction or activity One of the central concepts of economics is that externalities should be internalized unless some of the benefits of this positive externality can be captured by the parties the parties are under-rewarded for their inventions and systematic under-rewarding leads to under-investment in activities that lead to inventions The patent system captures those positive externalities for the inventor or other patent owner so that the economy as a whole invests an optimum amount of resources in the invention process Invention vs innovation   Innovation In the social sciences an innovation is something that is new better and has been adopted and proven to create positive value This is a key distinction from an invention which may not create positive value but furthers progress in a given area of development The theory for adoption of an innovation called diffusion of innovations considers the likelihood that an innovation is adopted and the taxonomy of persons likely to adopt it or spur its adoption This theory was first put forth by Everett Rogers     Gabriel Tarde also dealt with the adoption of innovations in his Laws of Imitation   Purposes of invention An invention can serve many purposes and does not necessarily create positive value These purposes might differ significantly and may change over time An invention or its development may serve purposes never envisioned by its inventors Plastic is a

law systems worldwide As is often the case for legal concepts its legal meaning is slightly different from common usage of the word Additionally the legal concept of invention is quite different in American and European patent law In Europe the first test a patent application must pass is \"Is this an invention?\" If it is subsequent questions are whether it is new and sufficiently inventive The implication counter-intuitively is that a legal invention is not inherently novel Whether a patent application relates to an invention is governed by Article   of the European Patent Convention that excludes e g discoveries as such and software as such The EPO Boards of Appeal decided that the technical character of an application is decisive for it to represent an invention following an age-old Italians and German tradition British courts don't agree with this interpretation Following a   Australian decision \"NRDC\" they believe that it is not possible to grasp the invention concept in a single rule A British court once stated that the technical character test implies a \" restatement of the problem in more imprecise terminology \" In the United States all patent applications are considered inventions The statute explicitly says that the American invention concept includes discoveries   USC   a contrary to the European invention concept The European invention concept corresponds to the American \"patentable subject matter\" concept the first test a patent application is submitted to While the statute   USC   virtually poses no limits to patenting whatsoever courts have decided in binding precedents that abstract ideas natural phenomena and laws of nature are not patentable Various attempts were made to substantiate the \"abstract idea\" test which suffers from abstractness itself but eventually none of them was successful The last attempt so far was the \"machine or transformation\" test but the U S Supreme Court decided in   that it is merely an indication at best Invention in the arts Invention has a long and important history in the arts Inventive thinking has always played a vital role in the creative process   While some inventions in the arts are patentable others are not because they cannot fulfill the strict requirements governments have established for granting them see patent Some inventions in art include the Collage and construction invented by Picasso Readymade invented by Marcel Duchamp mobile invented by Alexander Calder Combine invented by Robert Rauschenberg Shaped painting invented by Frank Stella Motion picture the invention of which is attributed to Eadweard Muybridge     Likewise Jackson Pollock invented an entirely new form of painting and a new kind of abstraction by dripping pouring splashing and splattering paint onto un-stretched canvas lying on the floor Inventive tools of the artist's trade also produced advances in creativity Impressionist painting became possible because of newly invented collapsible resealable metal paint tubes that facilitated spontaneous painting outdoors citation needed Inventions originally created in the form of artwork can also develop other uses i e

Harhoff Stefan Thomke Karim Lakhani Sonali Shah Susumu Ogawa Benjamin Mako Hill Eric von Hippel born August     is an American economist and a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management specializing in the nature and economics of distributed and open innovation He is best known for his work in developing the concept of user innovation that end-users rather than manufacturers are responsible for a large amount of innovation In order to describe this phenomenon in   he introduced the term lead user Hippel's work has applications in business strategy and free / open source software FOSS and he is one of the most highly cited social scientists writing on FOSS Eric von Hippel is the son of the material scientist and physicist Arthur Robert von Hippel who was also a

Hippel grew up in suburban Weston MA with his parents three brothers and one sister In his early years Eric attended public school within the town but then moved on to the Cambridge School of Weston a private progressive school for 8th grade as well as his later years Even as a young child outside of the classroom one of Eric's favorite pastimes was to try to create and invent new things Much of his inspiration came from his father Arthur Robert von Hippel who was also a professor at MIT Education edit For his undergraduate degree Eric von Hippel attended Harvard College In an interview with Eric he cited that he chose Harvard over MIT for the opportunity to pursue Liberal Arts as he majored in Economics His decision to focus in Economics stemmed from his trials in Biology and History and finding that neither was particularly the right fit for him After pursuing several inventions post undergraduate Eric returned to school for his Masters in Mechanical Engineering at MIT From there he went on to start his own company worked at management consultant McKinsey and Co and eventually studied at Carnegie Mellon University for his Ph D in Innovation Degrees edit Hamburg University of Technology Ph D   Hon Copenhagen Business School Ph D   Hon Ludwig-Maximillians Universit t M nchen Ph D   Hon Carnegie Mellon University Ph D   Massachusetts Institute of Technology S M   Harvard College B A   Major works edit Innovation by users and lead users edit User innovation is the idea that more users and consumers than suppliers are the innovators of new products Eric von Hippel was one of the first to notice this trend and explore it Products made by manufacturers are typically developed to meet a wide range of the needs of a wide range of people Therefore when a particular user experiences needs that are not yet felt by the majority of consumers they make the adjustments themselves to meet their own needs Often these ideas are then fed back to manufacturing companies from these users in the hope that the product will then be produced for them This process is called \"free revealing\" User innovation can be seen across a wide range of products from home cleaning equipment to medical devices In the field of scientific instruments Hippel's research has even found that user innovation is a dominant influence   User innovation extends not only to tangible products but also to services Hippel found that eighty-five percent of individuals self-provided themselves with accounting and banking processes before banks offered this service   More recently with Pedro Oliveira and colleagues studied the role of patients of chronic diseases and their caregivers in creating new solutions to help them cope with their health conditions They administered a survey to   rare disease patients/caregivers and found that   individuals 8% of the sample reported solutions that they personally find valuable and that are also evaluated as novel by expert medical evaluators If anything like this fraction of innovators holds for the overall population of hundreds of millions of people world-wide estimated to be afflicted by rare diseases patients and their caregivers may be a tremendous potential resource to improve management and care for many who are similarly afflicted   An extension of user innovations is the idea of lead users These are the individuals who first feel the need for a product or service and create it for themselves Lead user identification is an essential method used by companies to identify the newest innovations in their product areas giving them crucial insight on the needs of their users   Innovation toolkits edit On Eric von Hippel's website it is stated that innovation toolkits are used to organize and support information that is shared amongst various users and producers of projects   In one of his papers entitled \"Perspective User toolkits for innovation\" Hippel describes how user toolkits can be used to help manufacturers and companies determine the users' need-related aspects of products and services The users are provided with \"user toolkits for innovation\" to help the manufacturer outsource tasks that would normally take much time and effort within the company One of the first areas that user toolkits have been used was in the design and manufacturing of custom integrated circuits   In this field it was critical that manufacturers understood user needs because it could result in months of delays costing the company thousands of dollars LSI Logic produced a software design tool that its customers could use to design circuits themselves This move helped LSI grow to be one of the major players in the custom IC market and competitors were soon moving in the same direction \"Toolkits for user innovation are coordinated sets of \"user-friendly\" design tools that enable users to develop new product innovations for themselves The toolkits are not general purpose Rather they are specific to the design challenges of a specific field or sub field such as integrated circuit design or software product design \"   Toolkits should have the following features   Learning by trial-and-error An appropriate solution space A user-friendly toolkit Commonly used modules Result easily created by user Sticky information and its uses edit Sticky information is information that is expensive to obtain transmit and employ in a new location compared to where it originated \"We define the stickiness of a given unit of information in a given instance as the incremental expenditure required to transfer that unit of information to a specified locus in a form usable by a given information seeker When this cost is low information stickiness is low when it is high stickiness is high\" Eric von Hippel     Eric von Hippel has worked to define how sticky information influences innovation and how to overcome stickiness when trying to develop a new technology Sticky information is often encountered when a manufacturers would like to know about how current users feel about their needs and if their needs are being met or not by current product lines However this information would be difficult to acquire for the manufacturer though it would be tremendously helpful in their pursuit of product innovation Information can be sticky for a number of reasons Much information that humans have is tacit and therefore is difficult to communicate when sharing information Additionally some technical information is composed of a very large number of parts Sometimes it is difficult to communicate all of these especially when some operating procedures or techniques are so routine a regular practitioner may forget to include such details The stickiness of a particular type of information can have influences on how advances are made in the field For example if a particular company holds much of the expertise and knowledge for a particular technology it will likely be difficult for another company to make advancements that originate from the original technology Innovations are more likely to occur in the original company This can also occur in a geographic manner Local information can also be sticky and innovations that help a particular area with a special problem are likely to come from that area as well   Measurements of innovation and innovation indicators edit Researchers have not started quantifying user innovation until recently It is important that researchers are able to measure innovation and gather statistics so that policymakers can see the impact of user innovation on modern day technologies Research has shown that many of the innovative products produced by manufacturers were ideas stemmed off from \"lead users \"   Eric von Hippel has written several papers regarding \"Measurements of Innovation\" and \"Innovation Indicators \" In one of his papers he discusses his work with Fred Gault to survey     Canadian manufacturing plants to determine the prevalence of user innovation They were able to determine that \"About 20% of the user-innovators surveyed reported transferring their innovations to other users and/or equipment suppliers and the majority of these at least sometimes did so at no charge to recipients \"   These types of innovation indicators will help the government and other researchers to see the impact of users on innovation Innovation strategies and lead user identification edit Eric von Hippel has focused on the following major areas of innovation strategies in his research Task partitioning Improvement of innovation processes Pyramiding Task partitioning refers to innovation projects that are partitioned into smaller tasks Hippel proposes that \"problem-solving inter-dependence among tasks can be predicted in many projects and can then be managed by strategies involving   adjustment of the task specifications and/or   reduction of the barriers to problem-solving interaction across selected or all task boundaries \"   Hippel calls attention to the improvement of innovation processes with great detail He feels that the processes call for more scrutiny and that in turn \"their improvement can significantly affect the kinds of research problems that can be addressed the efficiency and speed with which R&D can be performed and the competitive positions of firms employing them \"   In his published work Hippel considers it critical for market researchers to look for lead users \"users who are on the leading edge of each identified trend in terms of related new product and process and who expect to obtain a relatively high net benefit from solutions to those needs \"   Pyramiding is a search process based upon the view that people with a strong interest in a topic or field tend to know people more expert than themselves von Hippel states that it can sometimes be hard to identify lead users or the next CEO of any given company and pyramiding can assist in this process   The Sources of Innovation   ISBN 0-19-509422-0 Oxford University Press PDF Democratizing Innovation   ISBN 0-262-22074-1 Creative Commons PDF Inspiration and Influences edit Even as a child Eric von Hippel was innovative As he has written \" when you're a child if you don't like what you have you make it yourself\" referring to the skateboards and scooters of past generations Children designed and produced these products for themselves because they were not available to them otherwise Hippel became very interested in this phenomenon and how it worked which guided his path to where he is today Hippel looks to the work of Nathan Rosenberg of Stanford University whose research looks at the economics of technological change and the economic role of science as well as economic history and development   Professor Richard Nelson of Columbia University who focuses on the processes of long-run economic change with particular emphasis on technological advances   As well as Professor Anne Carter of Brandeis who specializes in the fields of changing specialization of businesses and of workers economics of information technical change and technology transfer   Hippel also sees Dr Nikolaus Franke of the Vienna University of Economics and Business as a great influence in the field of product innovation Franke heads an institute on lead user innovation methods and also focuses on market research   Additional information edit In an interview with Eric von Hippel he stated that his favorite aspects of his job were research work and teaching and specifically working with doctoral students His own favorite teacher was a high school biology teacher whom Hippel describes as \"a wonderful guy \" who showed him amazing new things in a new light He has said his idol is Jean Piaget a psychologist and philosopher who focused on learning about the stages of children's lives from observations In this leisure time Hippel enjoys talking to people and spending time with his children His wife Jessie is an editor of scholarly books and journal articles and also a tennis player his daughter Christiana has a master's degree student in Public Health at Indiana University and the first recipient of the Ryan White Legacy Scholarship for her work in promoting sexual health and his son Eric James studies the Japanese language and culture independently The family has a cockatiel named Merlin   When Eric von Hippel's daughter Christiana was young he often made up cat-related bedtime stories because cats were her favorite animal When she was fourteen and they were traveling they wrote these stories down and called them \"Christiana in Catlandia \"   Future works edit Hippel hopes to measure how many users innovate and what types of people do this type of work He would like to show that most innovation is still user innovation He finds it interesting that in the United Kingdom some 8%     million people of consumers modify the products they use He has also noted that hospitals have the right to develop and use ideas as long as they do not sell them and he would like to persuade the institutional review board to approve

innovations     navigation search The diffusion of innovations according to Jon With successive groups of consumers adopting the new technology shown in blue its market share yellow will eventually reach the saturation level In mathematics the yellow curve is known as the error function The curve is broken into sections of adopters Diffusion of innovations is a theory that seeks to explain how why and at what rate new ideas and technology spread Everett Rogers a professor of communication studies popularized the theory in his book Diffusion of Innovations the book was first published in   and is now in its fifth edition     Rogers argues that diffusion is the process by which an innovation is communicated over time among the participants in a social system The origins of the diffusion of innovations theory are varied and span multiple disciplines Rogers proposes that four main elements influence the spread of a new idea the innovation itself communication channels time and a social system This process relies heavily on human capital The innovation must be widely adopted in order to self-sustain Within the rate of adoption there is a point at which an innovation reaches critical mass The categories of adopters are innovators early adopters early majority late majority and laggards   Diffusion manifests itself in different ways and is highly subject to the type of adopters and

Criticism       References     Notes     History edit The concept of diffusion was first studied by the French sociologist Gabriel Tarde in late 19th century   and by German and Austrian anthropologists and geographers such as Friedrich Ratzel and Leo Frobenius   The study of diffusion of innovations took off in the subfield of rural sociology in the midwestern United States in the 1920s and 1930s Agriculture technology was advancing rapidly and researchers started to examine how independent farmers were adopting hybrid seeds equipment and techniques   A study of the adoption of hybrid corn seed in Iowa by Ryan and Gross   solidified the prior work on diffusion into a distinct paradigm that would be cited consistently in the future     Since its start in rural sociology Diffusion of Innovations has been applied to numerous contexts including medical sociology communications marketing development studies health promotion organizational studies knowledge management conservation biology   and complexity studies   with a particularly large impact on the use of medicines medical techniques and health communications   In organizational studies its basic epidemiological or internal-influence form was formulated by H Earl Pemberton   who provided examples of institutional diffusion   such as postage stamps and standardized school ethics codes In   Everett Rogers a professor of rural sociology published his seminal work Diffusion of Innovations Rogers synthesized research from over   diffusion studies across the fields that initially influenced the theory anthropology early sociology rural sociology education industrial sociology and medical sociology Using his synthesis Rogers produced a theory of the adoption of innovations among individuals and organizations   Diffusion of Innovations and Rogers' later books are among the most often cited in diffusion research His methodologies are closely followed in recent diffusion research even as the field has expanded into and been influenced by other methodological disciplines such as social network analysis and communication     Elements edit The key elements in diffusion research are Element Definition Innovation Innovation are a broad category relative to the current knowledge of the analyzed unit Any idea practice or object that is perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption could be considered an innovation available for study   Adopters Adopters are the minimal unit of analysis In most studies adopters are individuals but can also be organizations businesses schools hospitals etc clusters within social networks or countries   Communication channels Diffusion by definition takes place among people or organizations Communication channels allow the transfer of information from one unit to the other   Communication patterns or capabilities must be established between parties as a minimum for diffusion to occur   Time The passage of time is necessary for innovations to be adopted they are rarely adopted instantaneously In fact in the Ryan and Gross   study on hybrid corn adoption adoption occurred over more than ten years and most farmers only dedicated a fraction on their fields to the new corn in the first years after adoption     Social system The social system is the combination of external influences mass media surfactants organizational or governmental mandates and internal influences strong and weak social relationships distance from opinion leaders   There are many roles in a social system and their combination represents the total influences on a potential adopter   Characteristics of innovations edit Studies have explored many characteristics of innovations Meta-reviews have identified several characteristics that are common among most studies   These are in line with the characteristics that Rogers initially cited in his reviews   Potential adopters evaluate an innovation on its relative advantage the perceived efficiencies gained by the innovation relative to current tools or procedures its compatibility with the pre-existing system its complexity or difficulty to learn its trialability or testability its potential for reinvention using the tool for initially unintended purposes and its observed effects These qualities interact and are judged as a whole For example an innovation might be extremely complex reducing its likelihood to be adopted and diffused but it might be very compatible with a large advantage relative to current tools Even with this high learning curve potential adopters might adopt the innovation anyway   Studies also identify other characteristics of innovations but these are not as common as the ones that Rogers lists above   The fuzziness of the boundaries of the innovation can impact its adoption Specifically innovations with a small core and large periphery are easier to adopt   Innovations that are less risky are easier to adopt as the potential loss from failed integration is lower   Innovations that are disruptive to routine tasks even when they bring a large relative advantage might not be adopted because of added instability Likewise innovations that make tasks easier are likely to be adopted   Closely related to relative complexity knowledge requirements are the ability barrier to use presented by the difficulty to use the innovation Even when there are high knowledge requirements support from prior adopters or other sources can increase the chances for adoption   Characteristics of individual adopters edit Like innovations adopters have been determined to have traits that affect their likelihood to adopt an innovation A bevy of individual personality traits have been explored for their impacts on adoption but with little agreement   Ability and motivation which vary on situation unlike personality traits have a large impact on a potential adopter's likelihood to adopt an innovation Unsurprisingly potential adopters who are motivated to adopt an innovation are likely to make the adjustments needed to adopt it   Motivation can be impacted by the meaning that an innovation holds innovations can have symbolic value that encourage or discourage adoption   First proposed by Ryan and Gross   the overall connectedness of a potential adopter to the broad community represented by a city   Potential adopters who frequent metropolitan areas are more likely to adopt an innovation Finally potential adopters who have the power or agency to create change particularly in organizations are more likely to adopt an innovation than someone with less power over his choices   Characteristics of organizations edit Organizations face more complex adoption possibilities because organizations are both the aggregate of its individuals and its own system with a set of procedures and norms   Three organizational characteristics match well with the individual characteristics above tension for change motivation and ability innovation-system fit compatibility and assessment of implications observability Organizations can feel pressured by a tension for change If the organization's situation is untenable it will be motivated to adopt an innovation to change its fortunes This tension often plays out among its individual members Innovations that match the organization's pre-existing system require fewer coincidental changes and are easy to assess are more likely to be adopted   The wider environment of the organization often an industry community or economy exerts pressures on the organization too Where an innovation is diffusing through the organization's environment for any reason the organization is more likely to adopt it   Innovations that are intentionally spread including by political mandate or directive are also likely to diffuse quickly     Process edit   Transtheoretical model Stages of change Diffusion occurs through a five step decision-making process It occurs through a series of communication channels over a period of time among the members of a similar social system Ryan and Gross first identified adoption as a process in     Rogers' five stages steps awareness interest evaluation trial and adoption are integral to this theory An individual might reject an innovation at any time during or after the adoption process Abrahamson examined this process critically by posing questions such as How do technically inefficient innovations diffuse and what impedes technically efficient innovations from catching on? Abrahamson makes suggestions for how organizational scientists can more comprehensively evaluate the spread of innovations   In later editions of Diffusion of Innovation Rogers changes his terminology of the five stages to knowledge persuasion decision implementation and confirmation However the descriptions of the categories have remained similar throughout the editions Five stages of the adoption process Stage Definition Knowledge The individual is first exposed to an innovation but lacks information about the innovation During this stage the individual has not yet been inspired to find out more information about the innovation Persuasion The individual is interested in the innovation and actively seeks related information/details Decision The individual takes the concept of the change and weighs the advantages/disadvantages of using the innovation and decides whether to adopt or reject the innovation Due to the individualistic nature of this stage Rogers notes that it is the most difficult stage on which to acquire empirical evidence   Implementation The individual employs the innovation to a varying degree depending on the situation During this stage the individual also determines the usefulness of the innovation and may search for further information about it Confirmation The individual finalizes his/her decision to continue using the innovation This stage is both intrapersonal may cause cognitive dissonance and interpersonal confirmation the group has made the right decision Decisions edit Two factors determine what type a particular decision is Whether the decision is made freely and implemented voluntarily Who makes the decision Based on these considerations three types of innovation-decisions have been identified   Type Definition Optional Innovation-Decision made by an individual who is in some way distinguished from others Collective Innovation-Decision made collectively by all participants Authority Innovation-Decision made for the entire social system by individuals in positions of influence or power Rate of adoption edit The rate of adoption is defined as the relative speed at which participants adopt an innovation Rate is usually measured by the length of time required for a certain percentage of the members of a social system to adopt an innovation   The rates of adoption for innovations are determined by an individual s adopter category In general individuals who first adopt an innovation require a shorter adoption period adoption process when compared to late adopters Within the adoption curve at some point the innovation reaches critical mass This is when the number of individual adopters ensures that the innovation is self-sustaining Adoption strategies edit Rogers outlines several strategies in order to help an innovation reach this stage including when an innovation adopted by a highly respected individual within a social network and creating an instinctive desire for a specific innovation Another strategy includes injecting an innovation into a group of individuals who would readily use said technology as well as providing positive reactions and benefits for early adopters Diffusion vs adoption edit Adoption is an individual process detailing the series of stages one undergoes from first hearing about a product to finally adopting it Diffusion signifies a group phenomenon which suggests how an innovation spreads Adopter categories edit Rogers defines an adopter category as a classification of individuals within a social system on the basis of innovativeness In the book Diffusion of Innovations Rogers suggests a total of five categories of adopters in order to standardize the usage of adopter categories in diffusion research The adoption of an innovation follows an S curve when plotted over a length of time   The categories of adopters are innovators early adopters early majority late majority and laggards   In addition to the gatekeepers and opinion leaders who exist within a given community change agents may come from outside the community Change agents bring innovations to new communities first through the gatekeepers then through the opinion leaders and so on through the community Adopter category Definition Innovators Innovators are willing to take risks have the highest social status have financial liquidity are social and have closest contact to scientific sources and interaction with other innovators Their risk tolerance allows them to adopt technologies that may ultimately fail Financial resources help absorb these failures   Early adopters These individuals have the highest degree of opinion leadership among the adopter categories Early adopters have a higher social status financial liquidity advanced education and are more socially forward than late adopters They are more discreet in adoption choices than innovators They use judicious choice of adoption to help them maintain a central communication position   Early Majority They adopt an innovation after a varying degree of time that is significantly longer than the innovators and early adopters Early Majority have above average social status contact with early adopters and seldom hold positions of opinion leadership in a system Rogers   p   Late Majority They adopt an innovation after the average participant These individuals approach an innovation with a high degree of skepticism and after the majority of society has adopted the innovation Late Majority are typically skeptical about an innovation have below average social status little financial liquidity in contact with others in late majority and early majority and little opinion leadership Laggards They are the last to adopt an innovation Unlike some of the previous categories individuals in this category show little to no opinion leadership These individuals typically have an aversion to change-agents Laggards typically tend to be focused on \"traditions\" lowest social status lowest financial liquidity oldest among adopters and in contact with only family and close friends Failed diffusion edit Failed diffusion does not mean that the technology was adopted by no one Rather failed diffusion often refers to diffusion that does not reach or approach 100% adoption due to its own weaknesses competition from other innovations or simply a lack of awareness From a social networks perspective a failed diffusion might be widely adopted within certain clusters but fail to make an impact on more distantly related people Networks that are over-connected might suffer from a rigidity that prevents the changes an innovation might bring as well     Sometimes some innovations also fail as a result of lack of local involvement and community participation For example Rogers discussed a situation in Peru involving the implementation of boiling drinking water to improve health and wellness levels in the village of Los Molinas The residents had no knowledge of the link between sanitation and illness The campaign worked with the villagers to try to teach them to boil water burn their garbage install latrines and report cases of illness to local health agencies In Los Molinas a stigma was linked to boiled water as something that only the \"unwell\" consumed and thus the idea of healthy residents boiling water prior to consumption was frowned upon The two-year educational campaign was considered to be largely unsuccessful This failure exemplified the importance of the roles of the communication channels that are involved in such a campaign for social change An examination of diffusion in El Salvador determined that there can be more than one social network at play as innovations are communicated One network carries information and the other carries influence While people might hear of an innovation's uses in Rogers' Los Molinas sanitation case a network of influence and status prevented adoption     Heterophily and communication channels edit Lazarsfeld and Merton first called attention to the principles of homophily and its opposite heterophily Using their definition Rogers defines homophily as \"the degree to which pairs of individuals who interact are similar in certain attributes such as beliefs education social status and the like\"   When given the choice individuals usually choose to interact with someone similar to themselves Homophilous individuals engage in more effective communication because their similarities lead to greater knowledge gain as well as attitude or behavior change As a result homophilous people tend to promote diffusion among each other   However diffusion requires a certain degree of heterophily to introduce new ideas into a relationship if two individuals are identical no diffusion occurs because there is no new information to exchange Therefore an ideal situation would involve potential adopters who are homophilous in every way except in knowledge of the innovation   Promotion of healthy behavior provides an example of the balance required of homophily and heterophily People tend to be close to others of similar health status   As a result people with unhealthy behaviors like smoking and obesity are less likely to encounter information and behaviors that encourage good health This presents a critical challenge for health communications as ties between heterophilous people are relatively weaker harder to create and harder to maintain   Developing heterophilous ties to unhealthy communities can increase the effectiveness of the diffusion of good health behaviors Once one previously homophilous tie adopts the behavior or innovation the other members of that group are more likely to adopt it too   The role of social systems edit Opinion leaders edit Not all individuals exert an equal amount of influence over others In this sense opinion leaders are influential in spreading either positive or negative information about an innovation Rogers relies on the ideas of Katz & Lazarsfeld and the two-step flow theory in developing his ideas on the influence of opinion leaders   Opinion leaders have the most influence during the evaluation stage of the innovation-decision process and on late adopters   In addition opinion leaders typically have greater exposure to the mass media more cosmopolitan greater contact with change agents more social experience and exposure higher socioeconomic status and are more innovative than others Research was done in the early 1950s at the University of Chicago attempting to assess the cost-effectiveness of broadcast advertising on the diffusion of new products and services   The findings were that opinion leadership tended to be organized into a hierarchy within a society with each level in the hierarchy having most influence over other members in the same level and on those in the next level below it The lowest levels were generally larger in numbers and tended to coincide with various demographic attributes that might be targeted by mass advertising However it found that direct word of mouth and example were far more influential than broadcast messages which were only effective if they reinforced the direct influences This led to the conclusion that advertising was best targeted if possible on those next in line to adopt and not on those not yet reached by the chain of influence Research on actor-network theory ANT also identifies a significant overlap between the ANT concepts and the diffusion of innovation which examine the characteristics of innovation and its context among various interested parties within a social system to assemble a network or system which implements innovation   Other research relating the concept to public choice theory finds that the hierarchy of influence for innovations need not and likely does not coincide with hierarchies of official political or economic status   Elites are often not innovators and innovations may have to be introduced by outsiders and propagated up a hierarchy to the top decision makers Electronic communication social networks edit Prior to the introduction of the Internet it was argued that social networks had a crucial role in the diffusion of innovation particularly tacit knowledge in the book The IRG Solution hierarchical incompetence and how to overcome it   The book argued that the widespread adoption of computer networks of individuals would lead to much better diffusion of innovations with greater understanding of their possible shortcomings and the identification of needed innovations that would not have otherwise occurred The social model proposed by Ryan and Gross   is expanded by Valente who uses social networks as a basis for adopter categorization instead of solely relying on the system-level analysis used by Ryan and Gross Valente also looks at an individual's personal network which is a different application than the organizational perspective espoused by many other scholars   Recent research by Wear shows that particularly in regional and rural areas significantly more innovation takes place in communities which have stronger inter-personal networks   Organizations edit Innovations are often adopted by organizations through two types of innovation-decisions collective innovation decisions and authority innovation decisions The collective decision occurs when adoption is by consensus The authority decision occurs by adoption among very few individuals with high positions of power within an organization   Unlike the optional innovation decision process these decision processes only occur within an organization or hierarchical group Within an organization certain individuals are termed \"champions\" who stand behind an innovation and break through opposition The champion plays a very similar role as the champion used within the efficiency business model Six Sigma The process contains five stages that are slightly similar to the innovation-decision process that individuals undertake These stages are agenda-setting matching redefining/restructuring clarifying and routinizing Extensions of the theory edit Policy edit Diffusion of Innovations has been applied beyond its original domains In the case of political science and administration policy diffusion focuses on how institutional innovations are adopted by other institutions at the local state or country level An alternative term is 'policy transfer' where the focus is more on the agents of diffusion and the diffusion of policy knowledge such as in the work of Diane Stone   Specifically policy transfer can be defined as \"knowledge about how policies administrative arrangements institutions and ideas in one political setting past or present is used in the development of policies administrative arrangements institutions and ideas in another political setting\"   The first interests with regards to policy diffusion were focused in time variation or state lottery adoption   but more recently interest has shifted towards mechanisms emulation learning and coercion     or in channels of diffusion   where researchers find that regulatory agency creation is transmitted by country and sector channels At the local level examining popular city-level policies make it easy to find patterns in diffusion through measuring public awareness   At the international level economic policies have been thought to transfer among countries according to local politicians' learning of successes and failures elsewhere and outside mandates made by global financial organizations   As a group of countries succeed with a set of policies others follow as exemplified by the deregulation and liberalization across the developing world after the successes of the Asian Tigers The reintroduction of regulations in the early 2000s also shows this learning process which would fit under the stages of knowledge and decision can be seen as lessons learned by following China's successful growth   Technology edit Peres Muller and Mahajan suggested that diffusion is \"the process of the market penetration of new products and services that is driven by social influences which include all interdependencies among consumers that affect various market players with or without their explicit knowledge\"   Eveland evaluated diffusion from a phenomenological view stating \"Technology is information and exists only to the degree that people can put it into practice and use it to achieve values\"   Diffusion of existing technologies has been measured using \"S curves\" These technologies include radio television VCR cable flush toilet clothes washer refrigerator home ownership air conditioning dishwasher electrified households telephone cordless phone cellular phone per capita airline miles personal computer and the Internet These data   can act as a predictor for future innovations Diffusion curves for infrastructure   reveal contrasts in the diffusion process of personal technologies versus infrastructure Consequences of adoption edit Both positive and negative outcomes are possible when an individual or organization chooses to adopt a particular innovation Rogers states that this area needs further research because of the biased positive attitude that is associated with innovation   Rogers lists three categories for consequences desirable vs undesirable direct vs indirect and anticipated vs unanticipated In contrast Wejnert details two categories public vs private and benefits vs costs   Public versus private edit Public consequences comprise the impact of an innovation on those other than the actor while private consequences refer to the impact on the actor Public consequences usually involve collective actors such as countries states organizations or social movements The results are usually concerned with issues of societal well-being Private consequences usually involve individuals or small collective entities such as a community The innovations are usually concerned with the improvement of quality of life or the reform of organizational or social structures   Benefits versus costs edit Benefits of an innovation obviously are the positive consequences while the costs are the negative Costs may be monetary or nonmonetary direct or indirect Direct costs are usually related to financial uncertainty and the economic state of the actor Indirect costs are more difficult to identify An example would be the need to buy a new kind of pesticide to use innovative seeds Indirect costs may also be social such as social conflict caused by innovation   Marketers are particularly interested in the diffusion process as it determines the success or failure of a new product It is quite important for a marketer to understand the diffusion process so as to ensure proper management of the spread of a new product or service Mathematical treatment edit   Logistic function The diffusion of an innovation typically follows an S shaped curve which often resembles a logistic function Mathematical programming models such as the S-D model apply the diffusion of innovations theory to real data problems   In addition to that agent-based models follow a more intuitive process by designing individual-level rules to model diffusion of ideas and innovations   Complex systems models edit Complex network models can also be used to investigate the spread of innovations among individuals connected to each other by a network of peer-to-peer influences such as in a physical community or neighborhood   Such models represent a system of individuals as nodes in a network or graph The interactions that link these individuals are represented by the edges of the network and can be based on the probability or strength of social connections In the dynamics of such models each node is assigned a current state indicating whether or not the individual has adopted the innovation and model equations describe the evolution of these states over time   In threshold models   the uptake of technologies is determined by the balance of two factors the perceived usefulness sometimes called utility of the innovation to the individual as well as barriers to adoption such as cost The multiple parameters that influence decisions to adopt both individual and socially motivated can be represented by such models as a series of nodes and connections that represent real relationships Borrowing from social network analysis each node is an innovator an adopter or a potential adopter Potential adopters have a threshold which is a fraction of his neighbors who adopt the innovation that must be reached before he will adopt Over time each potential adopter views his neighbors and decides whether he should adopt based on the technologies they are using When the effect of each individual node is analyzed along with its influence over the entire network the expected level of adoption was seen to depend on the number of initial adopters and the network's structure and properties Two factors emerge as important to successful spread of the innovation the number of connections of nodes with their neighbors and the presence of a high degree of common connections in the network quantified by the clustering coefficient These models are particularly good at showing the impact of opinion leaders relative to others   Computer models are often used to investigate this balance between the social aspects of diffusion and perceived intrinsic benefit to the individuals   Criticism edit Because there are more than four thousand articles across many disciplines published on Diffusion of Innovations with a vast majority written after Rogers created a systematic theory there have been few widely adopted changes to the theory   Although each study applies the theory in slightly different ways this lack of cohesion has left the theory stagnant and difficult to apply with consistency to new problems     Diffusion is difficult to quantify because humans and human networks are complex It is extremely difficult if not impossible to measure what exactly causes adoption of an innovation   This is important particularly in healthcare Those encouraging adoption of health behaviors or new medical technologies need to be aware of the many forces acting on an individual and his or her decision to adopt a new behavior or technology Diffusion theories can never account for all variables and therefore might miss critical predictors of adoption   This variety of variables has also led to inconsistent results in research reducing heuristic value   Rogers placed the contributions and criticisms of diffusion research into four categories pro-innovation bias individual-blame bias recall problem and issues of equality The pro-innovation bias in particular implies that all innovation is positive and that all innovations should be adopted   Cultural traditions and beliefs can be consumed by another culture's through diffusion which can impose significant costs on a group of people   The one-way information flow from sender to receiver is another weakness of this theory The message sender has a goal to persuade the receiver and there is little to no reverse flow The person implementing the change controls the direction and outcome of the campaign In some cases this is the best approach but other cases require a more participatory approach   In complex environments where the adopter is receiving information from many sources and is returning feedback to the sender a one-way model is insufficient and multiple communication flows need to be examined

navigation search Induced innovation is a macroeconomic hypothesis first proposed in   by John Hicks in his work The Theory of Wages He proposed that \"a change in the relative prices of the factors of production is itself a spur to invention and to invention of a particular kind directed to economizing the use of a factor which has become relatively expensive \" Considerable literature has been produced on this hypothesis which is often presented in terms of the effects of wage increases as an encouragement to labor-saving innovation The hypothesis has also been applied to viewing increases in energy costs as a motivation for a more rapid improvement in energy efficiency of goods than would normally occur Contents   Induced Innovation in Climate Change   Induced innovation in agriculture       References Induced Innovation in Climate Change edit A significant application of Hicks theory can be found in the field of climate change The exponential population growth occurred in the last century has drastically increased pressure on natural resources   In order to have a sustainable future it s imperative to modify global strategies on climate change and the induced innovation theory can aid to model these policies   To calculate the human impact on the environment economists often use the I=P*A*T equation where I the impact variable for example energy consumption is the product of P the population A the affluence often embodied by GDPper capita and T the technology   The technical coefficient represents the efficiency of the system in use for particular resource and expresses the average state of technology The decrease of \"T\" would indicate a gain in efficiency however I could still be growing or remaining stable if the improved technology is not sufficient to compensate the effect of an increase in \"P\" and \"A\" Therefore a reduction in I would always mean that pressure on resources has lightened but this might not always be the consequence of using resources more efficiently reducing T   A fundamental issue of climate change is the excess of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere particularly CO2 as the result of an intensified economic activity Global GDP and CO2 emissions were growing at a corresponding rate in the until the 1970s   It was then that oil prices have increased exponentially causing people to reduce its consumption   According to Hicks theory a change in factor prices will stimulate development of technical innovation to reduce the use of the factor for which the price increased compared to other factors Following the oil shock significant investments were made in alternative sources of energy more efficient cars and heating systems to mitigate oil consumption As a result CO2 emissions started growing at a slower rate than GDP per capita Although petrol prices then dropped in the 1980s CO2 emissions have continued to grow more slowly than GDP This is an indication of a complete structural change in technology induced by the need to innovate   Induced innovation in agriculture edit The development of agriculture is a fundamental part of the world economic growth Being able to meet the demand of an exponentially growing population can be a challenging task especially if we consider that one of the most important factors land remains fairly fixed   According to the World Bank data less than 38% of the global surface area can be deemed usable for cultivation of crops or permanent pastures   Expanding such a number can only be achieved by remediation of soil in a certain area in order to make the land fertile Needless to say that such an intervention requires a huge investment that can be amortized only in a long period of time Therefore to meet the increasing demand countries are forced to drastically increase the productivity of the land they dispose   This is where induced innovation steps in In order to best explain how Hick s macroeconomic theory works let us consider a situation in which the demand for agricultural derived products increases as a result of either population growth or increased household income Theory states that in such a situation prices of inputs for which supply is inelastic will rise relative to prices of more elastic inputs Similarly if the supply of a particular input increases at a faster rate than the supply of other inputs the price of such input will decline relative to the price of the other factors of production used Ideally then farmers would be looking to replace or use less of the more inelastic and less responsive factors of production since they are the more expensive to use Therefore technical innovations that replace such inputs would guarantee less costs and hence more profits In other words when demand for their products increases farmers are lured by changes in relative prices to seek for technological alternatives that substitute the increasingly scarce factors of production   Here is where the government has to intervene Clearly agricultural workers can t develop these innovations themselves and therefore demand that public research institutions develop new technologies that will then be transformed into modernized machinery that agricultural supply firms can sell to local farmers Scientists will now study the best solution to this problem and respond by making the appropriate technical development such that producers can efficiently substitute the abundant inputs for the increasingly scarce factors Ultimately this will lead to a reduction of farmer s unit costs in the best possible way     edit

recherche \" which means \"to go about seeking\" the term itself being derived from the Old French term \" recerchier \" a compound word from \"re-\" + \"cerchier\" or \"sercher\" meaning 'search'   The earliest recorded use of the term was in     Definitions edit Research has been defined in a number of different ways A broad definition of research is given by Godwin Colibao \"In the broadest sense of the word the definition of research includes any gathering of data information and facts for the advancement of knowledge \"   Another definition of research is given by John W Creswell who states that \" r esearch is a process of steps used to collect and analyze information to increase our understanding of a topic or issue\" It consists of three steps pose a question collect data to answer the question and present an answer to the question   The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines research in more detail as \"a studious inquiry or examination especially investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts revision of accepted theories or laws in the light of new facts or practical application of such new or revised theories or laws\"   Forms of research edit Original research redirects here For the Wikipedia policy see Wikipedia No original research Original research is research that is not exclusively based on a summary review or synthesis of earlier publications on the subject of research This material is of a primary source character The purpose of the original research is to produce new knowledge rather than to present the existing knowledge in a new form e g summarized or classified     Original research can take a number of forms depending on the discipline it pertains to In experimental work it typically involves direct or indirect observation of the researched subject s e g in the laboratory or in the field documents the methodology results and conclusions of an experiment or set of experiments or offers a novel interpretation of previous results In analytical work there are typically some new for example mathematical results produced or a new way of approaching an existing problem In some subjects which do not typically carry out experimentation or analysis of this kind the originality is in the particular way existing understanding is changed or re-interpreted based on the outcome of the work of the researcher   The degree of originality of the research is among major criteria for articles to be published in academic journals and usually established by means of peer review   Graduate students are commonly required to perform original research as part of a dissertation   Scientific research is a systematic way of gathering data and harnessing curiosity This research provides scientific information and theories for the explanation of the nature and the properties of the world It makes practical applications possible Scientific research is funded by public authorities by charitable organizations and by private groups including many companies Scientific research can be subdivided into different classifications according to their academic and application disciplines Scientific research is a widely used criterion for judging the standing of an academic institution but some argue that such is an inaccurate assessment of the institution because the quality of research does not tell about the quality of teaching these do not necessarily correlate   Research in the humanities involves different methods such as for example hermeneutics and semiotics Humanities scholars usually do not search for the ultimate correct answer to a question but instead explore the issues and details that surround it Context is always important and context can be social historical political cultural or ethnic An example of research in the humanities is historical research which is embodied in historical method Historians use primary sources and other evidence to systematically investigate a topic and then to write histories in the form of accounts of the past Other studies aim to merely examine the occurrence of behaviours in societies and communities without particularly looking for reasons or motivations to explain these These studies may be qualitative or quantitative and can use a variety of approaches such as queer theory or feminist theory   Artistic research also seen as 'practice-based research' can take form when creative works are considered both the research and the object of research itself It is the debatable body of thought which offers an alternative to purely scientific methods in research in its search for knowledge and truth Scientific research edit   Scientific method Primary scientific research being carried out at the Microscopy Laboratory of the Idaho National Laboratory Scientific research equipment at MIT German maritime research vessel Sonne Generally research is understood to follow a certain structural process Though step order may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher the following steps are usually part of most formal research both basic and applied Observations and formation of the topic Consists of the subject area of one's interest and following that subject area to conduct subject related research The subject area should not be randomly chosen since it requires reading a vast amount of literature on the topic to determine the gap in the literature the researcher intends to narrow A keen interest in the chosen subject area is advisable The research will have to be justified by linking its importance to already existing knowledge about the topic Hypothesis A testable prediction which designates the relationship between two or more variables Conceptual definition Description of a concept by relating it to other concepts Operational definition Details in regards to defining the variables and how they will be measured/assessed in the study Gathering of data Consists of identifying a population and selecting samples gathering information from or about these samples by using specific research instruments The instruments used for data collection must be valid and reliable Analysis of data Involves breaking down the individual pieces of data to draw conclusions about it Data Interpretation This can be represented through tables figures and pictures and then described in words Test revising of hypothesis Conclusion reiteration if necessary A common misconception is that a hypothesis will be proven see rather null hypothesis Generally a hypothesis is used to make predictions that can be tested by observing the outcome of an experiment If the outcome is inconsistent with the hypothesis then the hypothesis is rejected see falsifiability However if the outcome is consistent with the hypothesis the experiment is said to support the hypothesis This careful language is used because researchers recognize that alternative hypotheses may also be consistent with the observations In this sense a hypothesis can never be proven but rather only supported by surviving rounds of scientific testing and eventually becoming widely thought of as true A useful hypothesis allows prediction and within the accuracy of observation of the time the prediction will be verified As the accuracy of observation improves with time the hypothesis may no longer provide an accurate prediction In this case a new hypothesis will arise to challenge the old and to the extent that the new hypothesis makes more accurate predictions than the old the new will supplant it Researchers can also use a null hypothesis which states no relationship or difference between the independent or dependent variables Historical research edit   Historical method German historian Leopold von Ranke     considered to be one of the founders of modern source-based history The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use historical sources and other evidence to research and then to write history There are various history guidelines that are commonly used by historians in their work under the headings of external criticism internal criticism and synthesis This includes lower criticism and sensual criticism Though items may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher the following concepts are part of most formal historical research   Identification of origin date Evidence of localization Recognition of authorship Analysis of data Identification of integrity Attribution of credibility Artistic research edit The controversial trend of artistic teaching becoming more academics-oriented is leading to artistic research being accepted as the primary mode of enquiry in art as in the case of other disciplines   One of the characteristics of artistic research is that it must accept subjectivity as opposed to the classical scientific methods As such it is similar to the social sciences in using qualitative research and intersubjectivity as tools to apply measurement and critical analysis   Artistic research has been defined by the University of Dance and Circus Dans och Cirkush gskolan DOCH Stockholm in the following manner - \"Artistic research is to investigate and test with the purpose of gaining knowledge within and for our artistic disciplines It is based on artistic practices methods and criticality Through presented documentation the insights gained shall be placed in a context \"   Artistic research aims to enhance knowledge and understanding with presentation of the arts   A more simple understanding by Julian Klein defines Artistic Research as any kind of research employing the artistic mode of perception   For a survey of the central problematics of today's Artistic Research see Giaco Schiesser   According to artist Hakan Topal in artistic research \"perhaps more so than other disciplines intuition is utilized as a method to identify a wide range of new and unexpected productive modalities\"   Most writers whether of fiction or non-fiction books also have to do research to support their creative work This may be factual historical or background research Background research could include for example geographical or procedural research   The Society for Artistic Research SAR publishes the triannual Journal for Artistic Research JAR     an international online open access and peer-reviewed journal for the identification publication and dissemination of artistic research and its methodologies from all arts disciplines and it runs the Research Catalogue RC       a searchable documentary database of artistic research to which anyone can contribute Patricia Leavy addresses eight arts-based research ABR genres narrative inquiry fiction-based research poetry music dance theatre film and visual art   In   ELIA European League of the Institutes of the Arts launched The Florence Principles' on the Doctorate in the Arts   The Florence Principles relating to the Salzburg Principles and the Salzburg Recommendations of EUA European University Association name seven points of attention to specify the Doctorate / PhD in the Arts compared to a scientific doctorate / PhD The Florence Principles have been endorsed and are supported also by AEC CILECT CUMULUS and SAR Economic research edit Economics relies on scientific research     Steps in conducting research edit Research is often conducted using the hourglass model structure of research   The hourglass model starts with a broad spectrum for research focusing in on the required information through the method of the project like the neck of the hourglass then expands the research in the form of discussion and results The major steps in conducting research are   Identification of research problem Literature review Specifying the purpose of research Determining specific research questions Specification of a conceptual framework sometimes including a set of hypotheses   Choice of a methodology for data collection Data collection Verifying data Analyzing and interpreting the data Reporting and evaluating research Communicating the research findings and possibly recommendations The steps generally represent the overall process however they should be viewed as an ever-changing iterative process rather than a fixed set of steps   Most research begins with a general statement of the problem or rather the purpose for engaging in the study   The literature review identifies flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study Often a literature review is conducted in a given subject area before a research question is identified A gap in the current literature as identified by a researcher then engenders a research question The research question may be parallel to the hypothesis The hypothesis is the supposition to be tested The researcher s collects data to test the hypothesis The researcher s then analyzes and interprets the data via a variety of statistical methods engaging in what is known as empirical research The results of the data analysis in rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis are then reported and evaluated At the end the researcher may discuss avenues for further research However some researchers advocate for the reverse approach starting with articulating findings and discussion of them moving \"up\" to identification of a research problem that emerges in the findings and literature review The reverse approach is justified by the transactional nature of the research endeavor where research inquiry research questions research method relevant research literature and so on are not fully known until the findings have fully emerged and been interpreted Rudolph Rummel says \" no researcher should accept any one or two tests as definitive It is only when a range of tests are consistent over many kinds of data researchers and methods can one have confidence in the results \"   Plato in Meno talks about an inherent difficulty if not a paradox of doing research that can be paraphrased in the following way \"If you know what you're searching for why do you search for it?! i e you have already found it If you don't know what you're searching for what are you searching for?!\"   Research methods edit The research room at the New York Public Library an example of secondary research in progress Maurice Hilleman is credited with saving more lives than any other scientist of the 20th century   The goal of the research process is to produce new knowledge or deepen understanding of a topic or issue This process takes three main forms although as previously discussed the boundaries between them may be obscure Exploratory research which helps to identify and define a problem or question Constructive research which tests theories and proposes solutions to a problem or question Empirical research which tests the feasibility of a solution using empirical evidence There are two major types of empirical research design qualitative research and quantitative research Researchers choose qualitative or quantitative methods according to the nature of the research topic they want to investigate and the research questions they aim to answer Qualitative research This involves understanding human behavior and the reasons that govern such behavior by asking a broad question collecting data in the form of words images video etc that is analyzed and searching for themes This type of research aims to investigate a question without attempting to quantifiably measure variables or look to potential relationships between variables It is viewed as more restrictive in testing hypotheses because it can be expensive and time-consuming and typically limited to a single set of research subjects citation needed Qualitative research is often used as a method of exploratory research as a basis for later quantitative research hypotheses citation needed Qualitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of social constructionism Social media posts are used for qualitative research   Quantitative research This involves systematic empirical investigation of quantitative properties and phenomena and their relationships by asking a narrow question and collecting numerical data to analyze it utilizing statistical methods The quantitative research designs are experimental correlational and survey or descriptive   Statistics derived from quantitative research can be used to establish the existence of associative or causal relationships between variables Quantitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of positivism The quantitative data collection methods rely on random sampling and structured data collection instruments that fit diverse experiences into predetermined response categories citation needed These methods produce results that are easy to summarize compare and generalize citation needed Quantitative research is concerned with testing hypotheses derived from theory or being able to estimate the size of a phenomenon of interest If the research question is about people participants may be randomly assigned to different treatments this is the only way that a quantitative study can be considered a true experiment citation needed If this is not feasible the researcher may collect data on participant and situational characteristics to statistically control for their influence on the dependent or outcome variable If the intent is to generalize from the research participants to a larger population the researcher will employ probability sampling to select participants   In either qualitative or quantitative research the researcher s may collect primary or secondary data Primary data is data collected specifically for the research such as through interviews or questionnaires Secondary data is data that already exists such as census data which can be re-used for the research It is good ethical research practice to use secondary data wherever possible   Mixed-method research i e research that includes qualitative and quantitative elements using both primary and secondary data is becoming more common   This method has benefits that using one method alone cannot offer For example a researcher may choose to conduct a qualitative study and follow it up with a quantitative study to gain additional insights   Big data has brought big impacts on research methods so that now many researchers do not put much effort into data collection furthermore methods to analyze easily available huge amounts of data have also been developed   Non-empirical research Non-empirical theoretical research is an approach that involves the development of theory as opposed to using observation and experimentation As such non-empirical research seeks solutions to problems using existing knowledge as its source This however does not mean that new ideas and innovations cannot be found within the pool of existing and established knowledge Non-empirical research is not an absolute alternative to empirical research because they may be used together to strengthen a research approach Neither one is less effective than the other since they have their particular purpose in science Typically empirical research produces observations that need to be explained then theoretical research tries to explain them and in so doing generates empirically testable hypotheses these hypotheses are then tested empirically giving more observations that may need further explanation and so on See Scientific method A simple example of a non-empirical task is the prototyping of a new drug using a differentiated application of existing knowledge another is the development of a business process in the form of a flow chart and texts where all the ingredients are from established knowledge Much of cosmological research is theoretical in nature Mathematics research does not rely on externally available data rather it seeks to prove theorems about mathematical objects Research ethics edit Research ethics involves the application of fundamental ethical principles to a variety of topics involving research including scientific research These include the design and implementation of research involving human experimentation animal experimentation various aspects of academic scandal including scientific misconduct such as fraud fabrication of data and plagiarism whistleblowing regulation of research etc Research ethics is most developed as a concept in medical research The key agreement here is the   Declaration of Helsinki The Nuremberg Code is a former agreement but with many still important notes Research in the social sciences presents a different set of issues than those in medical research   and can involve issues of researcher and participant safety empowerment and access to justice   When research involves human subjects obtaining informed consent from them is essential   Problems in research edit Methods of research edit In many disciplines Western methods of conducting research are predominant   Researchers are overwhelmingly taught Western methods of data collection and study The increasing participation of indigenous peoples as researchers has brought increased attention to the lacuna in culturally-sensitive methods of data collection Non-Western methods of data collection may not be the most accurate or relevant for research on non-Western societies For example \" Hua Oranga \" was created as a criterion for psychological evaluation in M ori populations and is based on dimensions of mental health important to the M ori people \"taha wairua the spiritual dimension taha hinengaro the mental dimension taha tinana the physical dimension and taha whanau the family dimension \"   Linguicism edit Periphery scholars face the challenges of exclusion and linguicism in research and academic publication As the great majority of mainstream academic journals are written in English multilingual periphery scholars often must translate their work to be accepted to elite Western-dominated journals   Multilingual scholars' influences from their native communicative styles can be assumed to be incompetence instead of difference   Publication Peer Review edit This article needs to be updated In particular This subsection's claims are potentially outdated in the \"digital age\" given that near-total penetration of Web access among scholars worldwide enables any scholar s to submit papers to any journal anywhere Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information May   Peer review is a form of self-regulation by qualified members of a profession within the relevant field Peer review methods are employed to maintain standards of quality improve performance and provide credibility In academia scholarly peer review is often used to determine an academic paper's suitability for publication Usually the peer review process involves experts in the same field who are consulted by editors to give a review of the scholarly works produced by a colleague of theirs from an unbiased and impartial point of view and this is usually done free of charge The tradition of peer reviews being done for free has however brought many pitfalls which are also indicative of why most peer reviewers decline many invitations to review   It was observed that publications from periphery countries rarely rise to the same elite status as those of North America and Europe because limitations on the availability of resources including high-quality paper and sophisticated image-rendering software and printing tools render these publications less able to satisfy standards currently carrying formal or informal authority in the publishing industry   These limitations in turn result in the under-representation of scholars from periphery nations among the set of publications holding prestige status relative to the quantity and quality of those scholars' research efforts and this under-representation in turn results in disproportionately reduced acceptance of the results of their efforts as contributions to the body of knowledge available worldwide Influence of the open-access movement edit The open access movement assumes that all information generally deemed useful should be free and belongs to a \"public domain\" that of \"humanity\"   This idea gained prevalence as a result of Western colonial history and ignores alternative conceptions of knowledge circulation For instance most indigenous communities consider that access to certain information proper to the group should be determined by relationships   There is alleged to be a double standard in the Western knowledge system On the one hand \"digital right management\" used to restrict access to personal information on social networking platforms is celebrated as a protection of privacy while simultaneously when similar functions are utilised by cultural groups i e indigenous communities this is denounced as \"access control\" and reprehended as censorship   Future perspectives edit Even though Western dominance seems to be prominent in research some scholars such as Simon Marginson argue for \"the need for a plural university world\"   Marginson argues that the East Asian Confucian model could take over the Western model This could be due to changes in funding for research both in the East and the West Focussed on emphasizing educational achievement East Asian cultures mainly in China and South Korea have encouraged the increase of funding for research expansion   In contrast in the Western academic world notably in the United Kingdom as well as in some state governments in the United States funding cuts for university research have occurred which some who? say may lead to the future decline of Western dominance in research Professionalisation edit The examples and perspective in this section may not represent a worldwide view of the subject You may improve this article discuss the issue on the talk page or

professionalisation of research has resulted in formal job titles In Russia edit In present-day Russia the former Soviet Union and in some post-Soviet states the term researcher Russian nauchny sotrudnik is both a generic term for a person who carried out scientific research as well as a job position within the frameworks of the USSR Academy of Sciences Soviet universities and in other research-oriented establishments The term is also sometimes translated as research fellow research associate etc The following ranks are known Junior Researcher Junior Research Associate Researcher

Nature   November   Academic publishing is a system that is necessary for academic scholars to peer review the work and make it available for a wider audience The system varies widely by field and is also always changing if often slowly Most academic work is published in journal article or book form There is also a large body of research that exists in either a thesis or dissertation form These forms of research can be found in databases explicitly for theses and dissertations In publishing STM publishing is an abbreviation for academic publications in science technology and medicine Most established academic fields have their own scientific journals and other outlets for publication though many academic journals are somewhat interdisciplinary and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields The kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions of knowledge or research vary greatly between fields from the print to the electronic format A study suggests that researchers should not give great consideration to findings that are not replicated frequently   It has also been suggested that all published studies should be subjected to some measure for assessing the validity or reliability of its procedures to prevent the publication of unproven findings   Business models are different in the electronic environment Since about the early 1990s licensing of electronic resources particularly journals has been very common Presently a major trend particularly with respect to scholarly journals is open access   There are two main forms of open access open access publishing in which the articles or the whole journal is freely available from the time of publication and self-archiving where the author makes a copy of their own work freely available on the web Research funding edit   Funding of science Most funding for scientific research comes from three major sources corporate research and development departments private foundations for example the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and government research councils such as the National Institutes of Health in the USA   and the Medical Research Council in the UK These are managed primarily through universities and in some cases through military contractors Many senior researchers such as group leaders spend a significant amount of their time applying for grants for research funds These grants are necessary not only for researchers to carry out their research but also as a source of merit The Social Psychology Network provides a comprehensive list of U S Government and private foundation

"Technological innovation system     navigation search The technological innovation system is a concept developed within the scientific field of innovation studies which serves to explain the nature and rate of technological change   A Technological Innovation System can be defined as a dynamic network of agents interacting in a specific economic/industrial area under a particular institutional infrastructure and involved in the generation diffusion and utilization of technology   The approach may be applied to at least three levels of analysis to a technology in the sense of a knowledge field to a product or an artifact or to a set of related products and artifacts aimed at satisfying a particular societal function   With respect to the latter the approach has especially proven itself in explaining why and how sustainable energy technologies have developed and diffused into a society or have failed to do so Contents   Background   Structures   Dynamics     Seven system functions     Cumulative causation     Acquiring new technologies and capabilities       References     Notes     Further reading Background edit The concept of a technological innovation system was introduced as part of a wider theoretical school called the innovation system approach The central idea behind this approach is that determinants of technological change are not only to be found in individual firms or in research institutes but also in a broad societal structure in which firms as well as knowledge institutes are embedded     Since the 1980s innovation system studies have pointed out the influence of societal structures on technological change and indirectly on long-term economic growth within nations sectors or technological fields The purpose of analyzing a Technological Innovation System is to analyze and evaluate the development of a particular technological field in terms of the structures and processes that support or hamper it Besides its particular focus there are two more analytical features that set the Technological Innovation System approach apart from other innovation system approaches Firstly the Technological Innovation System concept emphasizes that stimulating knowledge flows is not sufficient to induce technological change and economic performance There is a need to exploit this knowledge in order to create new business opportunities This stresses the importance of individuals as sources of innovation something which is sometimes overseen in the more macro-oriented nationally or sectorally oriented innovation system approaches   Secondly the Technological Innovation System approach often focuses on system dynamics   The focus on entrepreneurial action has encouraged scholars to consider a Technological Innovation System as something to be built up over time This was already put forward by Carlsson and Stankiewicz T echnological Innovation Systems are defined in terms of knowledge/competence flows rather than flows of ordinary goods and services They consist of dynamic knowledge and competence networks In the presence of an entrepreneur and sufficient critical mass such networks can be transformed into development blocks i e synergistic clusters of firms and technologies within an industry or a group of industries   This means that a Technological Innovation System may be analyzed in terms of its system components and/or in terms of its dynamics Both perspectives will be explained below Structures edit The system components of a Technological Innovation System are called structures These represent the static aspect of the system as they are relatively stable over time Three basic categories are distinguished Actors Actors involve organizations contributing to a technology as a developer or adopter or indirectly as a regulator financier etc It is the actors of a Technological Innovation System that through choices and actions actually generate diffuse and utilize technologies The potential variety of relevant actors is enormous ranging from private actors to public actors and from technology developers to technology adopters The development of a Technological Innovation System will depend on the interrelations between all these actors For example entrepreneurs are unlikely to start investing in their businesses if governments are unwilling to support them financially Visa-verse governments have no clue where financial support is necessary if entrepreneurs do not provide them with the information and the arguments they need to legitimate policy support Institutions Institutional structures are at the core of the innovation system concept   It is common to consider institutions as the rules of the game in a society or more formally the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction   A distinction can be made between formal institutions and informal institutions with formal institutions being the rules that are codified and enforced by some authority and informal institutions being more tacit and organically shaped by the collective interaction of actors Informal institutions can be normative or cognitive The normative rules are social norms and values with moral significance whereas cognitive rules can be regarded as collective mind frames or social paradigms   Examples of formal institutions are government laws and policy decisions firm directives or contracts also belong to this category An example of a normative rule is the responsibility felt by a company to prevent or clean up waste Examples of cognitive rules are search heuristics or problem-solving routines They also involve dominant visions and expectations held by the actors     Technological factors Technological structures consist of artefacts and the technological infrastructures in which they are integrated They also involve the techno-economic workings of such artefacts including costs safety reliability These features are crucial for understanding the feedback mechanisms between technological change and institutional change For example if R&D subsidy schemes supporting technology development should result in improvements with regard to the safety and reliability of applications this would pave the way for more elaborate support schemes including practical demonstrations These may in turn benefit technological improvements even more It should however be noted here that the importance of technological features has often been neglected by scholars   The structural factors are merely the elements that make up the system In an actual system these factors are all linked to each other If they form dense configurations they are called networks An example would be a coalition of firms jointly working on the application of a fuel cell guided by a set of problem-solving routines and supported by a subsidy program Likewise industry associations research communities policy networks user-supplier relations etc are all examples of networks An analysis of structures typically yields insight into systemic features - complementarities and conflicts - that constitute drivers and barriers for technology diffusion at a certain moment or within a given period in time Dynamics edit Structures involve elements that are relatively stable over time Nevertheless for many technologies especially newly emerging ones these structures are not yet fully in place For this reason mostly the scholars have recently enriched the literature on Technological Innovation Systems with studies that focus on the build-up of structures over time The central idea of this approach is to consider all activities that contribute to the development diffusion and use of innovations as system functions   These system functions are to be understood as types of activities that influence the build-up of a Technological Innovation System Each system function may be fulfilled in a variety of ways The premise is that in order to properly develop the system should positively fulfil all system functions Various lists of system functions have been constructed Authors like Bergek et al   Hekkert et al   Negro   and Suurs   give useful overviews These lists show much overlap and differences reside mostly in the particular way of clustering activities An example of such a list is provided below Note that it is also possible that activities negatively contribute to a system function These negative contributions imply a partial breakdown of the system In particular domestic instability has been shown to exert downward pressure on innovation systems while international threats and national security alliances have a significantly positive effect on national innovative performance   Seven system functions edit As an example the seven system functions defined by Hekkert are explained here F1 Entrepreneurial activities The classic role of the entrepreneur is to translate knowledge into business opportunities and eventually innovations The entrepreneur does this by performing market-oriented experiments that establish change both to the emerging technology and to the institutions that surround it The Entrepreneurial Activities involve projects aimed to prove the usefulness of the emerging technology in a practical and/or commercial environment Such projects typically take the form of experiments and demonstrations F2 Knowledge development The Knowledge Development function involves learning activities mostly on the emerging technology but also on markets networks users etc There are various types of learning activities the most important categories being learning-by-searching and learning-by-doing The former concerns R&D activities in basic science whereas the latter involves learning activities in a practical context for example in the form of laboratory experiments or adoption trials F3 Knowledge diffusion / knowledge exchange through networks The characteristic organization structure of a Technological Innovation System is that of the network The primary function of networks is to facilitate the exchange of knowledge between all the actors involved in it Knowledge Diffusion activities involve partnerships between actors for example technology developers but also meetings like workshops and conferences The important role of Knowledge Diffusion stems from Lundvall s notion of interactive learning as the raison-d tre of any innovation system   The innovation system approach stresses that innovation happens only where actors of different backgrounds interact A special form of interactive learning is learning-by-using which involves learning activities based on the experience of users of technological innovations for example through user-producer interactions F4 Guidance of the search The Guidance of the Search function refers to activities that shape the needs requirements and expectations of actors with respect to their further support of the emerging technology Guidance of the Search refers to individual choices related to the technology but it may also take the form of hard institutions for example policy targets It also refers to promises and expectations as expressed by various actors in the community Guidance of the Search can be positive or negative A positive Guidance of the Search means a convergence of positive signals - expectations promises policy directives - in a particular direction of technology development If negative there will be a digression or even worse a rejection of development altogether This convergence is important since usually various technological options exist within an emerging technological field all of which require investments in order to develop further Since resources are usually limited it is important that specific foci are chosen After all without any focus there will be a dilution of resources preventing all options from prospering On the other hand too much focus may result in the loss of variety A healthy Technological Innovation System will strike a balance between creating and reducing variety F5 Market formation Emerging technologies cannot be expected to compete with incumbent technologies In order to stimulate innovation it is usually necessary to create artificial niche markets The Market Formation function involves activities that contribute to the creation of a demand for the emerging technology for example by financially supporting the use of the emerging technology or by taxing the use of competing technologies Market Formation is especially important in the field of sustainable energy technologies since in this case there usually is a strong normative legitimation for the intervention in market dynamics F6 Resource mobilization Resource Mobilization refers to the allocation of financial material and human capital The access to such capital factors is necessary for all other developments Typical activities involved in this system function are investments and subsidies They can also involve the deployment of generic infrastructures such as educational systems large R&D facilities or refueling infrastructures In some cases the mobilization of natural resources such as biomass oil or natural gas is important as well The Resource Mobilization function represents a basic economic variable Its importance is obvious an emerging technology cannot be supported in any way if there are no financial or natural means or if there are no actors present with the right skills and competences F7 Support from advocacy coalitions The rise of an emerging technology often leads to resistance from actors with interests in the incumbent energy system In order for a Technological Innovation System to develop other actors must counteract this inertia This can be done by urging authorities to reorganize the institutional configuration of the system The Support from Advocacy Coalitions function involves political lobbies and advice activities on behalf of interest groups This system function may be regarded as a special form of Guidance of the Search After all lobbies and advices are pleas in favor of particular technologies The essential feature which sets this category apart is that advocacy coalitions do not have the power like for example governments to change formal institutions directly Instead they employ the power of persuasion The notion of the advocacy coalition is based on the work of Sabatier who introduced the idea within the context of political science   The concept stresses the idea that structural change within a system is the outcome of competing interest groups each representing a separate system of values and ideas The outcome is determined by political power Cumulative causation edit Since Carlsson and Stankiewicz introduced the concept of a Technological Innovation System an increasing number of scholars have started focusing on dynamics A recurring theme within their studies has been the notion of cumulative causation closely related to the idea of a virtuous circle or vicious circle by Gunnar Myrdal   In this context cumulative causation is the phenomenon that the build-up of a Technological Innovation System accelerates due to system functions interacting and reinforcing each other over time For example the successful realization of a research project contributing to Knowledge Development may result in high expectations contributing to Guidance of the Search among policy makers which may subsequently trigger the start-up of a subsidy program contributing to Resource Mobilization which induces even more research activities Knowledge Development Guidance of the Search etc System functions may also reinforce each other downwards In that case interactions result in conflicting developments or a vicious circle! Recently scholars have increasingly paid attention to the question of how cumulative causation may be established often with a particular focus on the development of sustainable energy technologies   Acquiring new technologies and capabilities edit To improve competitiveness and retain sustainability firms require new technologies and capabilities In this age of rapid innovation and complexity it is challenging for the firms to develop internally and remain competitive at the same time Merger acquisition and alliance are some of the ways to achieve this but the primary driver is the desire to obtain valuable resources Many acquisitions failed to achieve their objectives and resulted in poor performance because of improper implementation   Improper documentation and changing implicit knowledge makes it difficult to share information during acquisition   For acquired firm symbolic and cultural independence which is the base of technology and capabilities are more important than administrative independence   Detailed knowledge exchange and integrations are difficult when the acquired firm is large and high performing   Management of executives from acquired firm is critical in terms of promotions and pay incentives to utilize their talent and value their expertise   Transfer of technologies and capabilities are most difficult task to manage because of complications of acquisition implementation The risk of losing implicit knowledge is always associated with the fast pace acquisition Preservation of tacit knowledge employees and literature are always delicate during and after acquisition Strategic management of all these resources is a very important factor for a successful acquisition Increase in acquisitions in our global business environment has pushed us to evaluate the key stake holders of acquisition very carefully before implementation It is imperative for the acquirer to understand this relationship and apply it to its advantage Retention is only possible when resources are exchanged and managed without affecting their independence   edit Relational capital Technological transitions"},

when to remove this template message A square in Venice an example of carfree city A car-free city or car free city is a population center that relies primarily on public transport walking or cycling for transport within the urban area Carfree cities greatly reduce petroleum dependency air pollution greenhouse gas emissions automobile crashes noise pollution urban heat island effect and traffic congestion Some cities have one or more districts where motorized vehicles are prohibited referred to as car-free zones Many older cities in Europe Asia and Africa were founded centuries before the advent of the automobile and some continue to have carfree areas in the oldest parts of the city -- especially in areas where it is impossible for cars to fit e g in narrow alleys Contents   History   Politics   Effects     Advantages     Disadvantages   Process   Examples       References   Further reading     History edit A theoretical design for a carfree city of one million people was first proposed by J H Crawford in   and further refined in his books Carfree Cities   and Carfree Design Manual   The Masdar City autonomous PRT Personal Rapid Transit network runs underground and within buildings allowing street spaces to be pedestrian only whilst maintaining the benefits of personal motor transit In   Abu Dhabi 's redevelopment agency released the masterplans for Masdar City designed to be a highly sustainable and fully planned city The plans were also focal on ground level street spaces being pedestrian only spaces with no personal motor vehicles being permitted within the city confines Thus aiming to be a walkable city and using fully electric and autonomous personal rapid transit for traveling greater distances   As part of the city council's   Urban Mobility Plan   Barcelona has implemented its 'superblock' designs wherein pedestrian-only spaces are created encompassing the interior streets of   city blocks   in some outer suburbs Politics edit Some proposed car free cities are government planned and funded such as Masdar City and The Great City near Chengdu in China   while others are planned privately such as The Venus Project designs In places without roads there is no need for taxation to pay for the roads Effects edit Advantages edit The direct benefits of car free urban designs are mainly in mitigating the negative effects found in many cities such as poor air quality from pollutants as a result of the combustive process used in many motor vehicles noise pollution and ground vibrations from the engine and vehicle use and reduction of the urban heat island effect   Another would be the obvious reduction of pedestrian and cyclist collisions The indirect benefits are predominantly to do with the revitalisation of the space triggering encouragement for people to be more physically active whether to commute exercise or for leisure This in turn can help lessen the implications that come with mental health and the segregation and isolation caused by car dependant societies Another obvious indirect effect is an enhanced sense of community or belonging as well as perceived 'ownership' This can mitigate sociological tension and further enhance public wellbeing Disadvantages edit Car free designs limit transport options Cities vary in their degree of automobile dependency and usually have a centralized urban structure Thus people living in suburbs and exurbs might gain little benefit and lose convenient access to the inner city due to redevelopment schemes for the CBD and wealthy residential areas Process edit Further information Braess' paradox Braess' paradox states that \"for each point of a road network let there be given the number of cars starting from it and the destination of the cars Under these conditions one wishes to estimate the distribution of traffic flow Whether one street is preferable to another depends not only on the quality of the road but also on the density of the flow If every driver takes the path that looks most favorable to him the resultant running times need not be minimal Furthermore it is indicated by an example that an extension of the road network may cause a redistribution of the traffic that results in longer individual running times \" An existing city can be made a car-free city by strategic closures of streets and squares to car traffic and reserving them to exclusive pedestrian use A pedestrian and bicycle network gradually emerges and joins several parts of the city Similarly prompted by the same need to avoid conflicts with car traffic and enhance pedestrian movement pedestrian networks have emerged below street level underground city or above road-level to connect large downtown areas as in the Minneapolis Skyway System For new areas on the fringe of cities or new towns two new complementary ideas have emerged The concept of Filtered Permeability   and a model for planning towns and subdivisions - the Fused Grid   Both focus on shifting the balance of network design in favor of pedestrian and bicycle mobility Examples edit   List of car-free places In Ghent in Belgium the entire city heart is car free public transport taxis and permit holders may enter but not exceed   km/h In Str get Copenhagen there is a large downtown car free shopping area The city of Venice serves as an example of how a modern city can function without cars This design was unintentional as the city was founded over     years ago a long time before the invention of the automobile Visitors who drive to the city or residents who own a car must park their car in a carpark outside of the city and then proceed either by foot or train into the city The predominant method of transportation in the city is by foot however most residents travel by motorised waterbuses vaporetti which travel the city's canals citation needed Other examples of carfree places are Mackinac Island and Paquet Island where cars are banned and the main transportation is by means of horses bicycles and boats Masdar City is most notable adopting a car-free design philosophy as part of its fundamental basis of being an eco-city Personal automotive vehicles are eliminated from the street spaces in favour of a walkable city design and use of its autonomous Personal Rapid Transit network for public transportation over greater distances The Great City in China is another example of a newly-developed city designed with the fundamentals of a car free city in mind     edit Bicycle City Car-Free Days Car-free movement Effects of the car on societies Jan Gehl In

and reuse /disposal   Sustainable sanitation is a sanitation system designed to meet certain criteria and to work well over the long-term The Sustainable Sanitation Alliance SuSanA includes five features or criteria in its definition of \"sustainable sanitation\" Systems need to be economically and socially acceptable technically and institutionally appropriate and protect the environment and natural resources   The purpose of sustainable sanitation is the same as sanitation in general to protect human health However \"sustainable sanitation\" attends to all process of the system This

Technologies Comparison with \"improved sanitation\" edit Further information Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation JMP of the WHO World Health Organisation and UNICEF United Nations Children's Fund was responsible for monitoring progress towards the Millennium Development Goal for drinking water and sanitation For reasons of simplicity being able to monitor the sanitation situation with household surveys the JMP had to find a simple differentiation between \"improved\" sanitation toilets that count towards the MDG goals and \"unimproved\" sanitation toilets that do not count towards the MDG goals According to the JMP definition improved sanitation facilities include facilities which are   not shared or public and which are one of the following toilet types flush or pour-flush to piped sewer system septic tank or pit latrine ventilated improved pit latrine pit latrine with slab or a composting toilet Unimproved sanitation facilities according to the JMP include   flush or pour-flush to elsewhere waste is flushed to the street yard or plot open sewer a ditch a drainage way or other location pit latrine without slab or open pit bucket toilet hanging toilet or hanging latrine or no facilities or bush or field open defecation In some circumstances \"improved\" sanitation facilities can be regarded as not sustainable whereas in other circumstances \"unimproved\" sanitation facilities can be regarded as sustainable This is because it depends on the sanitation system of which the toilet is only one part For example a pit latrine with a slab can become unsustainable sanitation if it is polluting the groundwater or if the waste sludge that is removed from the pit latrine is dumped into the environment A bucket toilet can become sustainable if the collection treatment and reuse or disposal of waste is taken care of in a safe manner for example with the urine-diverting dry toilets that SOIL is employing in Haiti   Comparison with ecosan edit Sustainable sanitation defined with the five sustainability measures may or may not have an focus on reuse of excreta because the criterion of \"protecting the natural resources\" is only one of several that need to be aimed towards In comparison ecological sanitation ecosan has a strong focus on the reuse of waste Sustainability criteria edit The main objective of a sanitation system is to protect and promote human health by providing a clean environment and breaking the cycle of disease In order to be sustainable a sanitation system has to be not only economically viable socially acceptable and technically and institutionally appropriate but it should also protect the environment and the natural resources According to the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance when improving an existing and/or designing a new sanitation system sustainability criteria related to the following aspects should be considered   Health edit Poorly handled fecal sludge poses high health risks lots of spillage and no personal protective equipmen t for the workers Health aspects include the risk of exposure to pathogens and hazardous substances that could affect public health at all points of the sanitation system from the toilet via the collection and treatment system to the point of reuse or disposal The topic also covers aspects such as hygiene nutrition and the improvement of livelihood achieved by the application of a certain sanitation system as well as downstream effects Environment and natural resources edit Environment and natural resources aspects involve the required energy water and other natural resources for construction operation and maintenance of the system as well as the potential emissions to the environment resulting from use It also includes the degree of recycling and reuse of excreta practiced and the effects of these for example reusing the wastewater returning nutrients and organic material to agriculture and the protecting of other non-renewable resources for example through the production of renewable energy e g biogas or fuel wood Technology and operation edit Technology and operation aspects incorporate the functionality and the ease with which the system can be constructed operated and monitored using the available human resources e g the local community technical team of the local utility etc It also concerns the suitability to achieve an efficient substance flow management from a technical point of view Furthermore it evaluates the robustness of the system its vulnerability towards disasters and the flexibility and adaptability of its technical elements to the existing infrastructure to demographic and socio-economic developments and climate change Finance and economics edit Financial and economic issues relate to the capacity of households and communities to pay for sanitation including the construction maintenance and depreciation of the system Besides the evaluation of investment operation and maintenance costs the topic also takes into account the economic benefits that can be obtained in productive sanitation systems including benefits from the production of the recyclables soil conditioner fertiliser energy and reclaimed water employment creation increased productivity through improved health and the reduction of environmental and public health costs Socio-cultural and institutional aspects edit Socio-cultural and institutional aspects take into account the socio-cultural acceptance and appropriateness of the system convenience system perceptions gender issues and impacts on human dignity the contribution to subsistence economies and food security and legal and institutional aspects Planning for sustainable sanitation edit Most sanitation systems have been designed with the five aspects in mind but in practice they are failing far too often because some of the criteria are not met Since there is no one-for-all sanitation solution which fulfils the sustainability criteria evaluation will depend on the local framework and will have to take into consideration the existing environmental technical socio-cultural and economic conditions Some basic principles to be observed when planning and implementing a sustainable sanitation system were endorsed by the members of the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council the Bellagio Principles for Sustainable Sanitation during its 5th Global Forum in November   Human dignity quality of life and environmental security at household level should be at the centre of any sanitation approach In line with good governance principles decision-making should involve participation of all stakeholders especially the consumers and providers of services Waste should be considered a resource and its management should be holistic and form part of integrated water resource nutrient flow and waste management processes The domain in which environmental sanitation problems are resolved should be kept to the minimum practicable size household community town district catchment city These planning guidelines have been revised further and are now used in various training courses for urban planners     Examples edit Some examples for improving present sanitation practices in the short-term purely from a technology perspective are listed below Pit latrines could be modified to be soil-composting latrines Arborloos thus requiring some wall reinforcement made shallow max 1-1   m and maintained using daily soil additions the pits would be periodically closed and covered with soil in order to allow for sanitization and composting prior to emptying and reuse in agriculture Simple urinals with separate collector systems could be installed instead of using toilets and pit latrines for urination Flush toilets could be modified to use less water or reuse greywater   Greywater could be source-separated from the blackwater from toilets thus simplifying its treatment and providing opportunities for reuse Blackwater from toilets could be held in conservancy tanks instead of open septic tanks and cess pits and then emptied and transported to biogas reactors alternatively the toilets could be connected to biogas reactors Cess or drainage pits e g from pour-flush toilets could be equipped with a safety zone of additional filter material to prevent contamination of ground water Above ground dry toilets with urine diversion could be installed in dry areas lacking water rocky areas where pits are expensive to dig and areas with high water tables and flooding With respect to the other sustainability factors key areas of attention the creation of an enabling environment market development and capacity development

environment minimally and connect people with the natural environment Great design is sustainable design Rather than considering green building design as an externality architects must think about it as a set of principles for great design This includes better user experience and comfort doing more with less to enable the building to easily achieve peak performance and maximizing the effectives of

design must create projects that are meaningful innovations that can shift behaviour A dynamic balance between economy and society intended to generate long-term relationships between user and object/service and finally to be respectful and mindful of the environmental and social differences   Conceptual problems edit Diminishing returns edit The principle that all directions of progress run out ending with diminishing returns is evident in the typical 'S' curve of the technology life cycle and in the useful life of any system as discussed in industrial ecology and life cycle assessment Diminishing returns are the result of reaching natural limits Common business management practice is to read diminishing returns in any direction of effort as an indication of diminishing opportunity the potential for accelerating decline and a signal to seek new opportunities elsewhere citation needed see also law of diminishing returns marginal utility and Jevons paradox Unsustainable investment edit A problem arises when the limits of a resource are hard to see so increasing investment in response to diminishing returns may seem profitable as in the Tragedy of the Commons but may lead to a collapse This problem of increasing investment in diminishing resources has also been studied in relation to the causes of civilization collapse by Joseph Tainter among others   This natural error in investment policy contributed to the collapse of both the Roman and Mayan among others Relieving over-stressed resources requires reducing pressure on them not continually increasing it whether more efficiently or not   Waste prevention edit Plans for Floriade   in Venlo the Netherlands \"The Greenest Building in the Netherlands - no external fuel electricity water or sewage \" Negative Effects of Waste About   million tonnes of waste in total are generated in the U K alone for example each year   And with reference to only household waste between 1991/92 and 2007/08 each person in England generated an average of     pounds of waste per day   Experience has now shown that there is no completely safe method of waste disposal All forms of disposal have negative impacts on the environment public health and local economies Landfills have contaminated drinking water Garbage burned in incinerators has poisoned air soil and water The majority of water treatment systems change the local ecology Attempts to control or manage wastes after they are produced fail to eliminate environmental impacts The toxic components of household products pose serious health risks and aggravate the trash problem In the U S about eight pounds in every ton of household garbage contains toxic materials such as heavy metals like nickel lead cadmium and mercury from batteries and organic compounds found in pesticides and consumer products such as air freshener sprays nail polish cleaners and other products   When burned or buried toxic materials also pose a serious threat to public health and the environment The only way to avoid environmental harm from waste is to prevent its generation Pollution prevention means changing the way activities are conducted and eliminating the source of the problem It does not mean doing without but doing differently For example preventing waste pollution from litter caused by disposable beverage containers does not mean doing without beverages it just means using refillable bottles Waste prevention strategies In planning for facilities a comprehensive design strategy is needed for preventing generation of solid waste A good garbage prevention strategy would require that everything brought into a facility be recycled for reuse or recycled back into the environment through biodegradation This would mean a greater reliance on natural materials or products that are compatible with the environment Any resource-related development is going to have two basic sources of solid waste materials purchased and used by the facility and those brought into the facility by visitors The following waste prevention strategies apply to both although different approaches will be needed for implementation   use products that minimize waste and are nontoxic compost or anaerobically digest biodegradable wastes reuse materials onsite or collect suitable materials for offsite recycling consuming less resources means creating less waste therefore it reduces the impact on the environment Sustainable design principles edit The California Academy of Sciences San Francisco California is a sustainable building designed by Renzo Piano It opened on September     One Central Park Sydney While the practical application varies among disciplines some common principles are as follows Low-impact materials choose non-toxic sustainably produced or recycled materials which require little energy to process Energy efficiency use manufacturing processes and produce products which require less energy Emotionally durable design reducing consumption and waste of resources by increasing the durability of relationships between people and products through design Design for reuse and recycling \"Products processes and systems should be designed for performance in a commercial 'afterlife' \"   Design impact measures for total carbon footprint and life-cycle assessment for any resource used are increasingly required and available ^   Many are complex but some give quick and accurate whole-earth estimates of impacts One measure estimates any spending as consuming an average economic share of global energy use of     BTU     kJ per dollar and producing CO2 at the average rate of     kg of CO2 per dollar   dollars US from DOE figures   Sustainable design standards and project design guides are also increasingly available and are vigorously being developed by a wide array of private organizations and individuals There is also a large body of new methods emerging from the rapid development of what has become known as 'sustainability science' promoted by a wide variety of educational and governmental institutions Biomimicry \"redesigning industrial systems on biological lines enabling the constant reuse of materials in continuous closed cycles \"   Service substitution shifting the mode of consumption from personal ownership of products to provision of services which provide similar functions e g from a private automobile to a carsharing service Such a system promotes minimal resource use per unit of consumption e g per trip driven   Renewable resource materials should come from nearby local or bioregional sustainably managed renewable sources that can be composted when their usefulness has been exhausted Robust eco-design robust design principles are applied to the design of a pollution sources   Bill of Rights for the Planet edit A model of the new design principles necessary for sustainability is exemplified by the \"Bill of Rights for the Planet\" or \"Hannover Principles\" - developed by William McDonough Architects for EXPO   that was held in Hannover Germany citation needed The Bill of Rights Insist on the right of humanity and nature to co-exist in a healthy supportive diverse and sustainable conditions Recognize Interdependence The elements of human design interact with and depend on the natural world with broad and diverse implications at every scale Expand design considerations to recognizing even distant effects Respect relationships between spirit and matter Consider all aspects of human settlement including community dwelling industry and trade in terms of existing and evolving connections between spiritual and material consciousness Accept responsibility for the consequences of design decisions upon human well-being the viability of natural systems and their right to co-exist Create safe objects of long-term value Do not burden future generations with requirements for maintenance or vigilant administration of potential danger due to the careless creations of products processes or standards Eliminate the concept of waste Evaluate and optimize the full life-cycle of products and processes to approach the state of natural systems in which there is no waste Rely on natural energy flows Human designs should like the living world derive their creative forces from perpetual solar income Incorporating this energy efficiently and safely for responsible use Understand the limitations of design No human creation lasts forever and design does not solve all problems Those who create and plan should practice humility in the face of nature Treat nature as a model and mentor not an inconvenience to be evaded or controlled Seek constant improvement by the sharing of knowledge Encourage direct and open communication between colleagues patrons manufacturers and users to link long term sustainable considerations with ethical responsibility and re-establish the integral relationship between natural processes and human activity These principles were adopted by the World Congress of the International Union of Architects UIA in June   at the American Institute of Architects' AIA Expo   in Chicago Further the AIA and UIA signed a \"Declaration of Interdependence for a Sustainable Future \" In summary the declaration states that today's society is degrading its environment and that the AIA UIA and their members are committed to Placing environmental and social sustainability at the core of practices and professional responsibilities Developing and continually improving practices procedures products services and standards for sustainable design Educating the building industry clients and the general public about the importance of sustainable design Working to change policies regulations and standards in government and business so that sustainable design will become the fully supported standard practice Bringing the existing built environment up to sustainable design standards In addition the Interprofessional Council on Environmental Design ICED a coalition of architectural landscape architectural and engineering organizations developed a vision statement in an attempt to foster a team approach to sustainable design ICED states The ethics education and practices of our professions will be directed to shape a sustainable future To achieve this vision we will join as a multidisciplinary partnership \" These activities are an indication that the concept of sustainable design is being supported on a global and interprofessional scale and that the ultimate goal is to become more environmentally responsive The world needs facilities that are more energy efficient and that promote conservation and recycling of natural and economic resources   Applications edit Applications of this philosophy range from the microcosm small objects for everyday use through to the macrocosm buildings cities and the Earth's physical surface It is a philosophy that can be applied in the fields of architecture landscape architecture urban design urban planning engineering graphic design industrial design interior design fashion design and human-computer interaction Sustainable design is mostly a general reaction to global environmental crises the rapid growth of economic activity and human population depletion of natural resources damage to ecosystems and loss of biodiversity   In   eco architecture writer Bridgette Meinhold surveyed emergency and long-term sustainable housing projects that were developed in response to these crises in her book Urgent Architecture   Sustainable Housing Solutions for a Changing World     Featured projects focus on green building sustainable design eco-friendly materials affordability material reuse and humanitarian relief Construction methods and materials include repurposed shipping containers straw bale construction sandbag homes and floating homes   The limits of sustainable design are reducing Whole earth impacts are beginning to be considered because growth in goods and services is consistently outpacing gains in efficiency As a result the net effect of sustainable design to date has been to simply improve the efficiency of rapidly increasing impacts The present approach which focuses on the efficiency of delivering individual goods and services does not solve this problem The basic dilemmas include the increasing complexity of efficiency improvements the difficulty of implementing new technologies in societies built around old ones that physical impacts of delivering goods and services are not localized but are distributed throughout the economies and that the scale of resource use is growing and not stabilizing Examples edit Beauty and sustainable design edit Because standards of sustainable design appear to emphasize ethics over aesthetics some designers and critics have complained that it lacks inspiration Pritzker Architecture Prize winner Frank Gehry has called green building \"bogus \"   and National Design Awards winner Peter Eisenman has dismissed it as \"having nothing to do with architecture \"   In   The American Prospect asked whether \"well-designed green architecture\" is an \"oxymoron \"   Others claim that such criticism of sustainable design is misguided A leading advocate for this alternative view is architect Lance Hosey whose book The Shape of Green Aesthetics Ecology and Design   was the first dedicated to the relationships between sustainability and beauty Hosey argues not just that sustainable design needs to be aesthetically appealing in order to be successful but also that following the principles of sustainability to their logical conclusion requires reimagining the shape of everything designed creating things of even greater beauty Reviewers have suggested that the ideas in The Shape of Green could \"revolutionize what it means to be sustainable \"   Small and large buildings are beginning to successfully incorporate principles of sustainability into award-winning designs Examples include One Central Park and the Science Faculty building UTS Emotionally durable design edit Stain Teacups Bethan Laura Wood   According to Jonathan Chapman of Carnegie Mellon University USA emotionally durable design reduces the consumption and waste of natural resources by increasing the resilience of relationships established between consumers and products \"   Essentially product replacement is delayed by strong emotional ties   In his book Emotionally Durable Design Objects Experiences & Empathy Chapman describes how \"the process of consumption is and has always been motivated by complex emotional drivers and is about far more than just the mindless purchasing of newer and shinier things it is a journey towards the ideal or desired self that through cyclical loops of desire and disappointment becomes a seemingly endless process of serial destruction\"   Therefore a product requires an attribute or number of attributes which extend beyond utilitarianism   According to Chapman 'emotional durability' can be achieved through consideration of the following five elements Narrative How users share a unique personal history with the product Consciousness How the product is perceived as autonomous and in possession of its own free will Attachment Can a user be made to feel a strong emotional connection to a product? Fiction The product inspires interactions and connections beyond just the physical relationship Surface How the product ages and develops character through time and use As a strategic approach \"emotionally durable design provides a useful language to describe the contemporary relevance of designing responsible well made tactile products which the user can get to know and assign value to in the long-term \"   According to Hazel Clark and David Brody of Parsons The New School for Design in New York emotionally durable design is a call for professionals and students alike to prioritise the relationships between design and its users as a way of developing more sustainable attitudes to and in design things   Play media Discussion by J l anna sk Hafberg of Likka Fashion Brand at the Reykjav k Art Museum Sustainable architecture edit   Sustainable architecture Sustainable building design Sustainable architecture is the design of sustainable buildings Sustainable architecture attempts to reduce the collective environmental impacts during the production of building components during the construction process as well as during the lifecycle of the building heating electricity use carpet cleaning etc This design practice emphasizes efficiency of heating and cooling systems alternative energy sources such as solar hot water appropriate building siting reused or recycled building materials on-site power generation - solar technology ground source heat pumps wind power rainwater harvesting for gardening washing and aquifer recharge and on-site waste management such as green roofs that filter and control stormwater runoff This requires close cooperation of the design team the architects the engineers and the client at all project stages from site selection scheme formation material selection and procurement to project implementation   Sustainable architects design with sustainable living in mind   Sustainable vs green design is the challenge that designs not only reflect healthy processes and uses but are powered by renewable energies and site specific resources A test for sustainable design is can the design function for its intended use without fossil fuel unplugged This challenge suggests architects and planners design solutions that can function without pollution rather than just reducing pollution As technology progresses in architecture and design theories and as examples are built and tested architects will soon be able to create not only passive null-emission buildings but rather be able to integrate the entire power system into the building design In   the   home housing community the Solar Settlement and a     sq ft     m   integrated retail commercial and residential building the Sun Ship were completed by architect Rolf Disch in Freiburg Germany The Solar Settlement is the first housing community worldwide in which every home all   produce a positive energy balance   An essential element of Sustainable Building Design is indoor environmental quality including air quality illumination thermal conditions and acoustics The integrated design of the indoor environment is essential and must be part of the integrated design of the entire structure ASHRAE Guideline 10-2011 addresses the interactions among indoor environmental factors and goes beyond traditional standards   Concurrently the recent movements of New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth architectural tradition and classical design     This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture as well as leaning against solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl   Both trends started in the 1980s The Driehaus Architecture Prize is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist Pritzker Prize   Sustainable landscape and garden design edit Main articles Sustainable landscape architecture Sustainable landscaping and Sustainable gardening Sustainable landscape architecture is a category of sustainable design and energy-efficient landscaping concerned with the planning and design of outdoor space Plants and materials may be bought from local growers to reduce energy used in transportation Design techniques include planting trees to shade buildings from the sun or protect them from wind using local materials and on-site composting and chipping not only to reduce green waste hauling but to increase organic matter and therefore carbon in the soil Some designers and gardeners such as Beth Chatto also use drought -resistant plants in arid areas xeriscaping and elsewhere so that water is not taken from local landscapes and habitats for irrigation Water from building roofs may be collected in rain gardens so that the groundwater is recharged instead of rainfall becoming surface runoff and increasing the risk of flooding Areas of the garden and landscape can also be allowed to grow wild to encourage bio-diversity Native animals may also be encouraged in many other ways by plants which provide food such as nectar and pollen for insects or roosting or nesting habitats such as trees or habitats such as ponds for amphibians and aquatic insects Pesticides especially persistent pesticides must be avoided to avoid killing wildlife Soil fertility can be managed sustainably by the use of many layers of vegetation from trees to ground-cover plants and mulches to increase organic matter and therefore earthworms and mycorrhiza nitrogen-fixing plants instead of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and sustainably harvested seaweed extract to replace micronutrients Sustainable landscapes and gardens can be productive as well as ornamental growing food firewood and craft materials from beautiful places Sustainable landscape approaches and labels include organic farming and growing permaculture agroforestry forest gardens agroecology vegan organic gardening ecological gardening and climate-friendly gardening Sustainable agriculture edit Main Organic farming Sustainable agriculture adheres to three main goals Environmental Health Economic Profitability Social and Economic Equity A variety of philosophies policies and practices have contributed to these goals People in many different capacities from farmers to consumers have shared this vision and contributed to it Despite the diversity of people and perspectives the following themes commonly weave through definitions of sustainable agriculture There are strenuous discussions among others by the agricultural sector and authorities if existing pesticide protocols and methods of soil conservation adequately protect topsoil and wildlife Doubt has risen if these are sustainable and if agrarian reforms would permit an efficient agriculture with fewer pesticides therefore reducing the damage to the ecosystem For more information on the subject of sustainable agriculture \"UC Davis Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program\"   Domestic machinery and furniture edit   Home appliances Automobiles home appliances and furnitures can be designed for repair and disassembly for recycling and constructed from recyclable materials such as steel aluminum and glass and renewable materials such as Zelfo wood and plastics from natural feedstocks Careful selection of materials and manufacturing processes can often create products comparable in price and performance to non-

technology in the energy sector is based on utilizing renewable sources of energy such as solar wind hydro bioenergy geothermal and hydrogen Wind energy is the world's fastest growing energy source it has been in use for centuries in Europe and more recently in the United States and other nations Wind energy is captured through the use of wind turbines that generate and transfer electricity for utilities homeowners and remote villages Solar power can be harnessed through photovoltaics concentrating solar or solar hot water and is also a rapidly growing energy source   Advancements in the technology and modifications to photovoltaics cells provide a more in depth untouched method for creating and producing solar power Researchers have found a potential way to use the photogalvanic effect to transform sunlight into electric energy   The availability potential and feasibility of primary renewable energy resources must be analyzed early in the planning process as part of a comprehensive energy plan The plan must justify energy demand and supply and assess the actual costs and benefits to the local regional and global environments Responsible energy use is fundamental to sustainable development and a sustainable future Energy management must balance justifiable energy demand with appropriate energy supply The process couples energy awareness energy conservation and energy efficiency with the use of primary renewable energy resources   Design for sustainable manufacturing edit Sustainable manufacturing can be defined as the creation of a manufactured product through a concurrent improvement in the resulting effect on factory and product sustainability The concept of sustainable manufacturing demands a renewed design of production systems in order to condition the related sustainability on product life cycle and Factory operations Designing sustainable production systems imply on the one hand the analysis and optimization of intra-factory aspects that are related to manufacturing plants Such aspects can regard the resource consumption restrain the process efficiency the ergonomics for the factory workers the elimination of hazardous substances the minimization of factory emissions and waste as well as internal emissions the integrated management of information in the production facilities and the technological updating of machines and plants Other inter-factories aspects concern the sustainable design of manufactured products product chain dematerialisation management of the background and foreground supply chains support of

Kerala Sustainable water technologies have become an important industry segment with several companies now providing important and scalable solutions to supply water in a sustainable manner Beyond the use of certain technologies Sustainable Design in Water Management also consists very importantly in correct implementation of concepts Among one of these principal concepts is the fact normally in developed countries 100% of water destined for consumption that is not necessarily for drinking purposes is of potable water quality This concept of differentiating qualities of water for different purposes has been called \"fit-for-purpose\"   This more rational use of water achieves several economies that are not only related to water itself but also the consumption of energy as to achieve water of drinking quality can be extremely energy intensive for several reasons Terminology edit In some countries the term sustainable design is known as ecodesign green design or environmental design Victor Papanek embraced social design and social quality and ecological quality but did not explicitly combine these areas of design concern in one term Sustainable design and design for sustainability are more common terms including the triple bottom line people planet and profit citation needed In the EU the concept of sustainable design is referred to as ecodesign Little discussions have however taken place over the importance of this concept in the run-up to the circular economy package that the European Commission will be tabling by the end of   To this effect an Ecothis EU campaign was launched to raise awareness about the economic and environmental consequences of not including eco-design as part of the circular economy package   Sustainable technologies edit Sustainable technologies use less energy fewer limited resources do not deplete natural resources do not directly or indirectly pollute the environment and can be reused or recycled at the end of their useful life   There is significant overlap with appropriate technology which emphasizes the suitability of technology to the context in particular considering the needs of people in developing countries However the most appropriate technology may not be the most sustainable one and a sustainable technology may have high cost or maintenance requirements that make it unsuitable as an

Objections to evolution Level of support Evolutionary biology portal Category Book Related topics v t e In biology and ecology extinction is the termination of an organism or of a group of organisms taxon normally a species The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of the species although the capacity to breed and recover may have been lost before this point Because a species' potential range may be very large determining this moment is difficult and is usually done retrospectively This difficulty leads to phenomena such as Lazarus taxa where a species presumed extinct abruptly \"reappears\" typically in the fossil record after a period of apparent absence More than   percent of all species amounting to over five billion species   that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct       Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from   million to   million   of which about     million have been documented and over   percent have not yet been described   More recently in May   scientists reported that   trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described   Through evolution species arise through the process of speciation where new varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an ecological niche and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition The relationship between animals and their ecological niches has been firmly established   A typical species becomes extinct within   million years of its first appearance   although some species called living fossils survive with virtually no morphological change for hundreds of millions of years Mass extinctions are relatively rare events however isolated extinctions are quite common Only recently have extinctions been recorded and scientists have become alarmed at the current high rate of extinctions         Most species that become extinct are never scientifically documented Some scientists estimate that up to half of presently existing plant and animal species may become extinct

Lepidodendron from the Upper Carboniferous of Ohio   A species is extinct when the last existing member dies Extinction therefore becomes a certainty when there are no surviving individuals that can reproduce and create a new generation A species may become functionally extinct when only a handful of individuals survive which cannot reproduce due to poor health age sparse distribution over a large range a lack of individuals of both sexes in sexually reproducing species or other reasons Pinpointing the extinction or pseudoextinction of a species requires a clear definition of that species If it is to be declared extinct the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor or daughter species and from any other closely related species Extinction of a species or replacement by a daughter species plays a key role in the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis of Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge   Skeleton of various extinct dinosaurs some other dinosaur lineages still flourish in the form of birds In ecology extinction is often used informally to refer to local extinction in which a species ceases to exist in the chosen area of study but may still exist elsewhere This phenomenon is also known as extirpation Local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations wolf reintroduction is an example of this Species which are not extinct are termed extant Those that are extant but threatened by extinction are referred to as threatened or endangered species The dodo of Mauritius shown here in a   illustration by Roelant Savery is an often-cited example of modern extinction   Currently an important aspect of extinction is human attempts to preserve critically endangered species These are reflected by the creation of the conservation status \"extinct in the wild\" EW Species listed under this status by the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN are not known to have any living specimens in the wild and are maintained only in zoos or other artificial environments Some of these species are functionally extinct as they are no longer part of their natural habitat and it is unlikely the species will ever be restored to the wild   When possible modern zoological institutions try to maintain a viable population for species preservation and possible future reintroduction to the wild through use of carefully planned breeding programs The extinction of one species' wild population can have knock-on effects causing further extinctions These are also called \"chains of extinction\"   This is especially common with extinction of keystone species Pseudoextinction edit   Pseudoextinction Extinction of a parent species where daughter species or subspecies are still extant is called pseudoextinction or phyletic extinction Effectively the old taxon vanishes transformed anagenesis into a successor   or split into more than one cladogenesis   Pseudoextinction is difficult to demonstrate unless one has a strong chain of evidence linking a living species to members of a pre-existing species For example it is sometimes claimed that the extinct Hyracotherium which was an early horse that shares a common ancestor with the modern horse is pseudoextinct rather than extinct because there are several extant species of Equus including zebra and donkey However as fossil species typically leave no genetic material behind one cannot say whether Hyracotherium evolved into more modern horse species or merely evolved from a common ancestor with modern horses Pseudoextinction is much easier to demonstrate for larger taxonomic groups Lazarus taxa edit   Lazarus taxa The coelacanth a fish related to lungfish and tetrapods was considered to have been extinct since the end of the Cretaceous Period until   when a specimen was found off the Chalumna River now Tyolomnqa on the east coast of South Africa   Museum curator Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer discovered the fish among the catch of a local angler Captain Hendrick Goosen on December       A local chemistry professor JLB Smith confirmed the fish's importance with a famous cable \"MOST IMPORTANT PRESERVE SKELETON AND GILLS = FISH DESCRIBED\"   Far more recent possible or presumed extinctions of species which may turn out still to exist include the thylacine or Tasmanian tiger Thylacinus cynocephalus the last known example of which died in Hobart Zoo in Tasmania in   the Japanese wolf Canis lupus hodophilax last sighted over   years ago the ivory-billed woodpecker Campephilus principalis last sighted for certain in   and the slender-billed curlew Numenius tenuirostris not seen since     Causes edit The passenger pigeon one of hundreds of species of extinct birds was hunted to extinction over the course of a few decades As long as species have been evolving species have been going extinct It is estimated that over   9% of all species that ever lived are extinct The average lifespan of a species is     million years   although this varies widely between taxa There are a variety of causes that can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species \"Just as each species is unique\" write Beverly and Stephen C Stearns \"so is each extinction the causes for each are varied some subtle and complex others obvious and simple\"   Most simply any species that cannot survive and reproduce in its environment and cannot move to a new environment where it can do so dies out and becomes extinct Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely as when toxic pollution renders its entire habitat unliveable or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors Extinction may occur a long time after the events that set it in motion a phenomenon known as extinction debt Assessing the relative importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the debate on nature and nurture   The question of whether more extinctions in the fossil record have been caused by evolution or by catastrophe is a subject of discussion Mark Newman the author of Modeling Extinction argues for a mathematical model that falls between the two positions   By contrast conservation biology uses the extinction vortex model to classify extinctions by cause When concerns about human extinction have been raised for example in Sir Martin Rees '   book Our Final Hour those concerns lie with the effects of climate change or technological disaster Currently environmental groups and some governments are concerned with the extinction of species caused by humanity and they try to prevent further extinctions through a variety of conservation programs   Humans can cause extinction of a species through overharvesting pollution habitat destruction introduction of invasive species such as new predators and food competitors overhunting and other influences Explosive unsustainable human population growth is an essential cause of the extinction crisis   According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN   extinctions have been recorded since the year   the arbitrary date selected to define \"recent\" extinctions up to the year   with many more likely to have gone unnoticed Several species have also been listed as extinct since     Genetics and demographic phenomena edit   Extinction vortex Genetic erosion and Mutational meltdown If adaptation increasing population fitness is slower than environmental degradation plus the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations then a population will go extinct   Smaller populations have fewer beneficial mutations entering the population each generation slowing adaptation It is also easier for slightly deleterious mutations to fix in small populations the resulting positive feedback loop between small population size and low fitness can cause mutational meltdown Limited geographic range is the most important determinant of genus extinction at background rates but becomes increasingly irrelevant as mass extinction arises   Limited geographic range is a cause both of small population size and of greater vulnerability to local environmental catastrophes Extinction rates can be affected not just by population size but by any factor that affects evolvability including balancing selection cryptic genetic variation phenotypic plasticity and robustness A diverse or deep gene pool gives a population a higher chance in the short term of surviving an adverse change in conditions Effects that cause or reward a loss in genetic diversity can increase the chances of extinction of a species Population bottlenecks can dramatically reduce genetic diversity by severely limiting the number of reproducing individuals and make inbreeding more frequent Genetic pollution edit   Genetic pollution Purebred wild species evolved to a specific ecology can be threatened with extinction   through the process of genetic pollution i e uncontrolled hybridization introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out-competition from the introduced or hybrid species   Endemic populations can face such extinctions when new populations are imported or selectively bred by people or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact Extinction is likeliest for rare species coming into contact with more abundant ones   interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids depleting the purebred gene pool for example the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the abundant domestic water buffalo Such extinctions are not always apparent from morphological non-genetic observations Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionarily process nevertheless hybridization with or without introgression threatens rare species' existence     The gene pool of a species or a population is the variety of genetic information in its living members A large gene pool extensive genetic diversity is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense selection Meanwhile low genetic diversity see inbreeding and population bottlenecks reduces the range of adaptions possible   Replacing native with alien genes narrows genetic diversity within the original population     thereby increasing the chance of extinction Scorched land resulting from slash-and-burn agriculture Habitat degradation edit   Habitat destruction Habitat degradation is currently the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture with urban sprawl logging mining and some fishing practices close behind The degradation of a species' habitat may alter the fitness landscape to such an extent that the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct This may occur by direct effects such as the environment becoming toxic or indirectly by limiting a species' ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species Habitat degradation through toxicity can kill off a species very rapidly by killing all living members through contamination or sterilizing them It can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span reproductive capacity or competitiveness Habitat degradation can also take the form of a physical destruction of niche habitats The widespread destruction of tropical rainforests and replacement with open pastureland is widely cited as an example of this   elimination of the dense forest eliminated the infrastructure needed by many species to survive For example a fern that depends on dense shade for protection from direct sunlight can no longer survive without forest to shelter it Another example is the destruction of ocean floors by bottom trawling   Diminished resources or introduction of new competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation Global warming has allowed some species to expand their range bringing unwelcome according to whom? competition to other species that previously occupied that area Sometimes these new competitors are predators and directly affect prey species while at other times they may merely outcompete vulnerable species for limited resources Vital resources including water and food can also be limited during habitat degradation leading to extinction The golden toad was last seen on May     Decline in amphibian populations is ongoing worldwide Predation competition and disease edit   Island restoration In the natural course of events species become extinct for a number of reasons including but not limited to extinction of a necessary host prey or pollinator inter-species competition inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions particularly sudden changes which can act to introduce novel predators or to remove prey Recently in geological time humans have become an additional cause of extinction many people would say premature extinction of some species either as a new mega-predator or by transporting animals and plants from one part of the world to another Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years sometimes intentionally e g livestock released by sailors on islands as a future source of food and sometimes accidentally e g rats escaping from boats In most cases the introductions are unsuccessful but when an invasive alien species does become established the consequences can be catastrophic Invasive alien species can affect native species directly by eating them competing with them and introducing pathogens or parasites that sicken or kill them or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators According to the \"overkill hypothesis\" the swift extinction of the megafauna in areas such as Australia     years before present North and South America     years before present Madagascar Hawaii     CE and New Zealand     CE resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques   Coextinction edit   Coextinction The large Haast's eagle and moa from New Zealand Coextinction refers to the loss of a species due to the extinction of another for example the extinction of parasitic insects following the loss of their hosts Coextinction can also occur when a species loses its pollinator or to predators in a food chain who lose their prey \"Species coextinction is a manifestation of the interconnectedness of organisms in complex ecosystems While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions it is certainly an insidious one\"   Coextinction is especially common when a keystone species goes extinct Models suggest that coextinction is the most common form of biodiversity loss There may be a cascade of coextinction across the trophic levels Such effects are most severe in mutualistic and parasitic relationships An example of coextinction is the Haast's eagle and the moa the Haast's eagle was a predator that became extinct because its food source became extinct The moa were several species of flightless birds that were a food source for the Haast's eagle   Climate change edit   Extinction risk from global warming   Effect of climate change on plant biodiversity Effects of climate change on terrestrial animals and Effects of climate change on marine mammals Extinction as a result of climate change has been confirmed by fossil studies   Particularly the extinction of amphibians during the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse   million years ago   A   review across   biodiversity research centers predicted that because of climate change   37% of land species would be \"committed to extinction\" by       The ecologically rich areas that would potentially suffer the heaviest losses include the Cape Floristic Region and the Caribbean Basin These areas might see a doubling of present carbon dioxide levels and rising temperatures that could eliminate     plant and     animal species   Climate change has also been found to be a factor in habitat loss and desertification   Mass extinctions edit   Extinction event Marine extinction intensity during the Phanerozoic %

event are clickable hyperlinks see Extinction event for more details source and image info There have been at least five mass extinctions in the history of life on earth and four in the last   million years in which many species have disappeared in a relatively short period of geological time A massive eruptive event is considered to be one likely cause of the \" Permian Triassic extinction event \" about   million years ago   which is estimated to have killed 90% of species then existing   There is also evidence to suggest that this event was preceded by another mass extinction known as Olson's Extinction   The Cretaceous Paleogene extinction event K-Pg occurred   million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period and is best known for having wiped out non-avian dinosaurs among many other species Modern extinctions edit   Holocene extinction Further information Deforestation and Defaunation According to a   survey of   biologists conducted by New York 's American Museum of Natural History nearly 70% believed that the Earth is currently in the early stages of a human-caused mass extinction   known as the Holocene extinction In that survey the same proportion of respondents agreed with the prediction that up to 20% of all living populations could become extinct within   years by   A   special edition of Science declared there is widespread consensus on the issue of human-driven mass species extinctions   Biologist E O Wilson estimated   in   that if current rates of human destruction of the biosphere continue one-half of all plant and animal species of life on earth will be extinct in   years   More significantly the current rate of global species extinctions is estimated as   to   times \"background\" rates the average extinction rates in the evolutionary time scale of planet Earth     while future rates are likely     times higher   However some groups are going extinct much faster Biologists Paul R Ehrlich and Stuart Pimm among others contend that human population growth and overconsumption are the main drivers of the modern extinction crisis         History of scientific understanding edit Dilophosaurus one of the many extinct dinosaur genera The cause of the Cretaceous Paleogene extinction event is a subject of much debate amongst researchers Georges Cuvier compared fossil mammoth jaws to those of living elephants concluding that they were distinct from any known living species   For much of history the modern understanding of extinction as the end of a species was incompatible with the prevailing worldview Through the 18th century much of Western society adhered to the belief that the world was created by God and as such was complete and perfect   This concept reached its heyday in the 1700s with the peak popularity of a theological concept called the Great Chain of Being in which all life on earth from the tiniest microorganism to God is linked in a continuous chain   The extinction of a species was impossible under this model as it would create gaps or missing links in the chain and destroy the natural order     Thomas Jefferson was a firm supporter of the Great Chain of Being and an opponent of extinction     famously denying the extinction of the wooly mammoth on the grounds that nature never allows a race of animals to become extinct   A series of fossils were discovered in the late 17th century that appeared unlike any living species As a result the scientific community embarked on a voyage of creative rationalization seeking to understand what had happened to these species within a framework that did not account for total extinction In October   Robert Hooke presented an impression of a nautilus to the Royal Society that was more than two feet in diameter   and morphologically distinct from any known living species Hooke theorized that this was simply because the species lived in the deep ocean and no one had discovered them yet   While he contended that it was possible a species could be \"lost\" he thought this highly unlikely   Similarly in   Thomas Molyneux published an account of enormous antlers found in Ireland that did not belong to any extant taxa in that area     Molyneux reasoned that they came from the North American moose and that the animal had once been common on the British Isles   Rather than suggest that this indicated the possibility of species going extinct he argued that although organisms could become locally extinct they could never be entirely lost and would continue to exist in some unknown region of the globe   Using the antlers as evidence for this position Molyneux described how moose had continued to exist in North America even as they were lost to the British Isles   The antlers were later confirmed to be from the extinct Irish elk Megaloceros   Hooke and Molyneux's line of thinking was difficult to disprove When parts of the world had not been thoroughly examined and charted scientists could not rule out that animals found only in the fossil record were not simply \"hiding\" in unexplored regions of the Earth   Georges Cuvier is credited with establishing the modern conception of extinction in a   lecture to the French Institute     though he would spend most of his career trying to convince the wider scientific community of his theory   Cuvier was a well-regarded geologist lauded for his ability to reconstruct the anatomy of an unknown species from a few fragments of bone   His primary evidence for extinction came from mammoth skulls found in the Paris basin   Cuvier recognized them as distinct from any known living species of elephant and argued that it was highly unlikely such an enormous animal would go undiscovered   In   Cuvier along with Alexandre Bronigniart & Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire mapped the strata of the Paris basin   They saw alternating saltwater and freshwater deposits as well as patterns of the appearance and disappearance of fossils throughout the record     From these patterns Cuvier inferred historic cycles of catastrophic flooding extinction and repopulation of the earth with new species     Cuvier s fossil evidence showed that very different life forms existed in the past than those that exist today a fact that was accepted by most scientists   The primary debate focused whether this turnover caused by extinction was gradual or abrupt in nature   Cuvier understood extinction to be the result of cataclysmic events that wipe out huge numbers of species as opposed to the gradual decline of a species over time   His catastrophic view of the nature of extinction garnered him many opponents in the newly emerging school of uniformitarianism   Jean-Baptist Lamarck a gradualist and colleague of Cuvier saw the fossils of different life forms as evidence of the mutable character of species   While Lamarck did not deny the possibility of extinction he believed that it was exceptional and rare and that most of the change in species over time was due to gradual change   Unlike Cuvier Lamarck was skeptical that catastrophic events of a scale large enough to cause total extinction were possible In his geological history of the earth titled Hydrogeologie Lamarck instead argued that the surface of the earth was shaped by gradual erosion and deposition by water and that species changed over time in response to the changing environment     Charles Lyell a noted geologist and founder of uniformitarianism believed that past processes should be understood using present day processes Like Lamarck Lyell acknowledged that extinction could occur noting the total extinction of the dodo and the extirpation of indigenous horses to the British Isles   He similarly argued against mass extinctions believing that any extinction must be a gradual process     Lyell also showed that Cuvier s original interpretation of the Parisian strata was incorrect Instead of the catastrophic floods inferred by Cuvier Lyell demonstrated that patterns of saltwater and freshwater deposits like those seen in the Paris basin could be formed by a slow rise and fall of sea levels   The concept of extinction was integral to Charles Darwin s On the Origin of Species with less fit lineages disappearing over time For Darwin extinction was a constant side effect of competition   Because of the wide reach of On the Origin of Species it was widely accepted that extinction occurred gradually and evenly a concept we now refer to as background extinction   It was not until   when David Raup and Jack Sepkoski published their seminal paper on mass extinctions that Cuvier was vindicated and catastrophic extinction was accepted as an important mechanism The current understanding of extinction is a synthesis of the cataclysmic extinction events proposed by Cuvier and the background extinction events proposed by Lyell and Darwin Human attitudes and interests edit Extinction is an important research topic in the field of zoology and biology in general and has also become an area of concern outside the scientific community A number of organizations such as the Worldwide Fund for Nature have been created with the goal of preserving species from extinction Governments have attempted through enacting laws to avoid habitat destruction agricultural over-harvesting and pollution While many human-caused extinctions have been accidental humans have also engaged in the deliberate destruction of some species such as dangerous viruses and the total destruction of other problematic species has been suggested Other species were deliberately driven to extinction or nearly so due to poaching or because they were \"undesirable\" or to push for other human agendas One example was the near extinction of the American bison which was nearly wiped out by mass hunts sanctioned by the United States government to force the removal of Native Americans many of whom relied on the bison for food   Biologist Bruce Walsh of the University of Arizona states three reasons for scientific interest in the preservation of species genetic resources ecosystem stability and ethics   and today the scientific community \"stress es the importance\" of maintaining biodiversity     In modern times commercial and industrial interests often have to contend with the effects of production on plant and animal life However some technologies with minimal or no proven harmful effects on Homo sapiens can be devastating to wildlife for example DDT   Biogeographer Jared Diamond notes that while big business may label environmental concerns as \"exaggerated\" and often cause \"devastating damage\" some corporations find it in their interest to adopt good conservation practices and even engage in preservation efforts that surpass those taken by national parks   Governments sometimes see the loss of native species as a loss to ecotourism   and can enact laws with severe punishment against the trade in native species in an effort to prevent extinction in the wild Nature preserves are created by governments as a means to provide continuing habitats to species crowded by human expansion The   Convention on Biological Diversity has resulted in international Biodiversity Action Plan programmes which attempt to provide comprehensive guidelines for government biodiversity conservation Advocacy groups such as The Wildlands Project   and the Alliance for Zero Extinctions   work to educate the public and pressure governments into action People who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment leaving them highly exposed to extinction risks However people prioritize day-to-day survival over species conservation with human overpopulation in tropical developing countries there has been enormous pressure on forests due to subsistence agriculture including slash-and-burn agricultural techniques that can reduce endangered species's habitats   Antinatalist philosopher David Benatar concludes that any popular concern about non-human species extinction usually arises out of concern about how the loss of a species will impact human wants and needs that \"we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal \" He notes that typical concerns about possible human extinction such as the loss of individual members are not considered in regards to non-human species extinction   Planned extinction edit   Eradication of infectious diseases Completed edit The smallpox virus is now extinct in the wild   although samples are retained in laboratory settings The rinderpest virus which infected domestic cattle is now extinct in the wild   Proposed edit The poliovirus is now confined to small parts of the world due to extermination efforts   Dracunculus medinensis a parasitic worm which causes the disease dracunculiasis is now close to eradication thanks to efforts led by the Carter Center   Treponema pallidum pertenue a bacterium which causes the disease yaws is in the process of being eradicated Biologist Olivia Judson has advocated the deliberate extinction of certain disease-carrying mosquito species In a September     New York Times article she advocated \"specicide\" of thirty mosquito species by introducing a genetic element which can insert itself into another crucial gene to create recessive \" knockout genes \"   She says that the Anopheles mosquitoes which spread malaria and Aedes mosquitoes which spread dengue fever yellow fever elephantiasis and other diseases represent only   species eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum at a cost of reducing the genetic diversity of the family Culicidae by only 1% She further argues that since species become extinct \"all the time\" the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the ecosystem \"We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other species but different need not mean worse \" In addition anti-malarial and mosquito control programs offer little realistic hope to the   million people in developing nations who will be infected with acute illnesses this year Although trials are ongoing she writes that if they fail \"We should consider the ultimate swatting \"   Biologist E O Wilson has advocated the eradication of several species of mosquito including malaria vector Anopheles gambiae Wilson stated \"I'm talking about a very small number of species that have co-evolved with us and are preying on humans so it would certainly be acceptable to remove them I believe it's just common sense \"   Cloning edit   De-extinction Some such as Harvard geneticist George M Church believe that ongoing technological advances will let us \"bring back to life\" an extinct species by cloning using DNA from the remains of that species Proposed targets for cloning include the mammoth the thylacine and the Pyrenean ibex For this to succeed enough individuals would have to be cloned from the DNA of different individuals in the case of sexually reproducing organisms to create a viable population Though bioethical and philosophical objections have been raised   the cloning of extinct creatures seems theoretically possible   In   scientists tried to clone the extinct Pyrenean ibex C p pyrenaica This attempt failed of the   embryos reconstructed   were transferred to   mountain goats and mountain goat - domestic goat hybrids but only two survived the initial two months of gestation before they too died   In   a second attempt was made to clone the Pyrenean ibex one clone was born alive but died seven minutes

Ecopsychology studies the relationship between human beings and the natural world through ecological and psychological principles   The field seeks to develop and understand ways of expanding the emotional connection between individuals and the natural world thereby assisting individuals with developing sustainable lifestyles and remedying alienation from nature Theodore Roszak is credited with coining the term in his   book The Voice of the Earth although a group of psychologists and environmentalists in Berkeley including Mary Gomes and Allen Kanner were independently using the term to describe their own work at the same time Roszak Gomes and Kanner later expanded the idea in the   anthology Ecopsychology Two other books were especially formative for the field Paul Shepard 's   volume \"Nature and Madness \" which explored the effect that our ever-diminishing engagement with wild nature had upon human psychological development and philosopher David Abram 's The Spell of the Sensuous Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World published in   The latter was the first widely read book to bring phenomenology to bear on ecological and ecopsychological issues examining in detail the earthly dimensions of sensory experience and disclosing the historical effect of formal writing systems upon the human experience of nature's agency voice and interiority A central premise of ecopsychology is that while today the human mind is affected and shaped by the modern social world its deep structure is inevitably adapted to and informed by the more-than-human natural environment in which it evolved   According to the biophilia hypothesis of biologist E O Wilson human beings have an innate instinct to connect emotionally with nature     particularly the aspects of nature that recall what evolutionary psychologists have termed the environment of evolutionary adaptiveness the natural conditions that the human species evolved to inhabit The field of ecopsychology extends beyond the conventional purview of psychology which had traditionally considered the psyche to be a matter of relevance to humans alone Ecopsychology examines why people continue environmentally damaging behaviour and to develop methods of positive motivation for adopting sustainable practices   Evidence suggests that many environmentally damaging behaviours are addictive at some level and thus are more effectively addressed through positive emotional fulfillment rather than by inflicting shame Other names used to refer to ecopsychology include depth ecology Gaia psychology   psychoecology ecotherapy environmental psychology green psychology transpersonal ecology global therapy green therapy Earth-centered therapy reearthing nature-based psychotherapy shamanic counselling ecosophy   and sylvan therapy Contents   Practical benefits   Reasons to embrace nature   Cultures that embrace nature   Pain and delusions without nature       References   Further reading     Practical benefits edit Certain researchers propose that an individual's connection to nature can improve their interpersonal relationships and emotional wellbeing   An integral part of this practice is to remove psychotherapy and the individual from the interior of office buildings and homes and place them outdoors   According to the precepts of ecopsychology a walk in the woods or a city park is refreshing because it is what humans evolved to do Psychologists such as Roger Ulrich Rachel and Stephen Kaplan Frances Kuo and others have studied the beneficial effects of inhabiting natural settings and of looking at pictures of landscapes on the human psyche Richard Louv 's Last Child in the Woods Saving our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder discusses in detail how the exposure of children to nature can assist in treating mental disorders including attention deficit disorder   Gardening is one way to experience the practical benefits of connecting with nature particularly in the contexts of stress reduction restoration and awareness Initial experimental research about stress-relieving effects showed subjects who gardened after situations of acute stress were able to fully recover from the event and their cortisol level measurements indicated positive mood increases after gardening   The psychological benefits of interactions with nature appear intensified at a smaller more compressed scale in gardens offering an accessible fast-paced view of plant life cycles   Also the practice of domestic gardening can improve sense of self-efficacy across ages particularly among the elderly   Psychologists are also interested in the ways plants influence attention and healing Plants are attributed as sources of positive distraction shifting the focus from sensations of discomfort to aesthetic properties of plants which creates perceived alleviation of pain   Individuals who have the opportunity to reconnect with nature through horticultural practices and in the wilderness can restore perceived sense of social connection joy and health   Interacting with nature is a practical preventative measure against mental-health issues that stem from rumination When a group of participants in one study went on a walk in nature they expressed lower levels of rumination and showed diminished neural activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex an area tied to mental illness while participants who walked through urban settings experienced no changes in either respect   Another premise of ecopsychology is that steps taken to accept and notice nature can sharpen the senses and help people cultivate new skills For example the ability to track and navigate through a wilderness is improved if nature is noticed and accepted rather than feared Similarly ecopsychology proposes that sailors who appreciate the sea gain a keen sense for breeze directions Psychologists have explored how senses subtly influence the brain in natural environments and impact a person's subjective well-being Plants in the visual sphere affect the brain whether or not they are the object of focus and the blue and green hues of nature may contribute to low-anxiety psychological states     Reasons to embrace nature edit Ecopsychology explores how to develop emotional bonds with nature   It considers this to be worthwhile because when nature is explored and viewed without judgement it gives the sensations of harmony balance timelessness and stability Ecopsychology largely rejects reductionist views of nature that focus upon rudimentary building blocks such as genes and that describe nature as selfish and a struggle to survive Ecopsychology considers that there has been insufficient scientific description and exploration of nature in terms of wildness parsimony spirituality and emotional ties For example parsimony is the best way to produce an evolutionary tree of the species cladistics suggesting that parsimonious adaptations are selected Yet today the brain is often seen as complicated and governed by inherited mind modules rather than being a simple organ that looks for parsimony within the influences of its surroundings resulting in the compaction in minds of a great diversity of concepts Cultures that embrace nature edit In its exploration of how to bond with nature ecopsychology is interested in the examples provided by a wide variety of ancient and modern cultures that have histories of embracing nature Examples include aboriginal pagan Jain Buddhist and Hindu cultures as well as shamanism and the more recent hesychast tradition Of interest is how identity becomes entwined with nature so that loss of those sacred places is far more devastating to indigenous people than often understood Native American stories in particular illustrate a socially recognized sense of community between humans and the natural landscape   The M ori philosophy and practice of kaitiakitanga or eco-guardianship and preservation emphasizes a deep connect between humans and their environment   Eastern Orthodox monks led a contemplative life deeply intertwined with nature   Other lessons include how to live sustainably within an environment and the self-sacrifices made to tolerate natural limits such as population control or a nomadic existence that allows the environment to regenerate Moreover certain indigenous cultures have developed methods of psychotherapy involving the presence of trees rivers and astronomical bodies   Pain and delusions without nature edit Ecopsychologists have begun detecting unspoken grief within individuals an escalation of pain and despair felt in response to widespread environmental destruction The field of ecopsychology intends to illustrate how environmental disconnection functions as an aspect of existing pathologies without creating a new category The contention is that if a culture is disconnected from nature then various aspects of an individual's life will be negatively impacted   It also believes that without the influence of nature humans are prone to a variety of delusions and that to some degree life in the wild forms the basis for human sanity and optimal psychological development The topic is explored in detail Paul Shepard 's book Nature and Madness It is also proposed that separation from outdoor contact causes a loss of sensory and information-processing ability that was developed over the course of human evolution which was spent in direct reciprocity with the environment     edit Biophilia hypothesis Conservation psychology

because there is no planet B \"   This thought has guided the development of the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs Negotiations on the Post-2015 Development Agenda began in January   and ended in August   A final document was adopted at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September   in New York City USA   On   September   the   countries of the UN General Assembly adopted the   Development Agenda titled \"Transforming our world the   Agenda for Sustainable Development\"     This agenda has   paragraphs Paragraph   outlines the   Sustainable Development Goals and the associated   targets UN agencies which are part of the United Nations Development Group decided to support an independent campaign to communicate the new SDGs to a wider audience This campaign \"Project Everyone \" had the support of corporate institutions and other international organizations   Using the text drafted by diplomats at the UN level a team of communication specialists developed icons for every goal   They also shortened the title \"The   Sustainable Development Goals\" to \" Global Goals /17#GlobalGoals \" then ran workshops and conferences to communicate the Global Goals to a global audience       The   goals edit There are   targets for the   goals Each target has between   and   indicators used to measure progress toward reaching the targets In total there are   indicators that will measure compliance   The United Nations Development Programme has been asked to provide easy to understand lists of targets and facts and figures for each of the   SDGs   The   goals listed below as sub-headings use the 2-to-4 word phrases that identify each goal Directly below each goal in quotation marks is the exact wording of the goal in one sentence The paragraphs that follow present some information about a few targets and indicators related to each goal A diagram listing the   Sustainable Development Goals Goal   No Poverty edit Global poverty rates \"End poverty in all its forms everywhere \"   edit Extreme poverty has been cut by more than half since   Still more than   in   people live on less than the target figure of US$1   per day That target may not be adequate for human subsistence however It may be necessary to raise the poverty line figure to as high as $5 per day   Poverty is more than the lack of income or resources People live in poverty if they lack basic services such as healthcare security and education They also experience hunger social discrimination and exclusion from decision making processes Children makeup the majority more than half of those living in extreme poverty In   an estimated   million children lived on less than US$1   per day   Still these figures are unreliable due to huge gaps in data on the status of children worldwide On average   percent of countries have insufficient data to determine the state of impoverished children and make projections towards SDG Goal   and   percent of countries have no data on child poverty at all   Gender inequality plays a large role in perpetuating poverty and its risks citation needed Women face potentially life-threatening risks from early pregnancy and frequent pregnancies This can result in lost hope for an education and a better income citation needed Poverty affects age groups differently with the most devastating effects experienced by children It affects their education health nutrition and security impacting emotional and spiritual development Achieving Goal   is hampered by growing inequality increasingly fragile statehood and the impacts of climate change   Goal   Zero Hunger edit \" End hunger achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture \"   edit Goal   targets state that by   we should end hunger and end all forms of malnutrition This would be accomplished by doubling agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers especially women and indigenous peoples ensuring sustainable food production systems and progressively improve land and soil quality Agriculture is the single largest employer in the world providing livelihoods for 40% of the global population It is the largest source of income for poor rural households Women make up about 43% of the agricultural labor force in developing countries and over 50% in parts of Asia and Africa However women own only 20% of the land Other targets deal with maintaining genetic diversity of seeds increasing access to land preventing trade restriction and distortions in world agricultural markets to limit extreme food price volatility eliminating waste with help from the International Food Waste Coalition and ending malnutrition and undernutrition of children Globally   in   people are undernourished the vast majority of whom live in developing countries Undernutrition causes wasting or severe wasting of   million children worldwide   and contributes to nearly half 45% of deaths in children under five     million children per year   Chronic malnutrition which affects an estimated   million children worldwide also stunts children's brain and physical growth and puts them at further risk of death disease and success as adults   As of   only   of   UN member countries are on track to meet the SDG target to eliminate undernourishment and malnourishment while   percent have made no progress at all and nearly   percent have no or insufficient data to determine their progress   A report by the International Food Policy Research Institute IFPRI of   stated that the emphasis of the SDGs should not be on ending poverty by   but on eliminating hunger and under-nutrition by     The assertion is based on an analysis of experiences in China Vietnam Brazil and Thailand Three pathways to achieve this were identified   agriculture-led   social protection- and nutrition intervention-led or   a combination of both of these approaches   Goal   Good Health and Well-Being for people edit \"Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages \"   edit Significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated with child and maternal mortality Between   and   the worldwide under-five mortality rate decreased by   percent from   deaths per     live births to   deaths per     live births   Still the number of children dying under age   is extremely high     million died in   alone   Newborns account for a growing number of these deaths and poorer children are at the greatest risk of under-5 mortality due to a number of factors   SDG Goal   aims reduce under-five mortality to at least as low as   per     live births But if current trends continue more than   countries will miss the SDG neonatal mortality target for   About half of these countries would not reach the target even by     Goal   also aims to reduce maternal mortality to less than   deaths per     live births   Though the maternal mortality ratio declined by   percent between   and   there were approximately     maternal deaths worldwide in   most from preventable causes   In   maternal health conditions were also the leading cause of death among girls aged 15-19   Data for girls of greatest concern those aged between 10-14 is currently unavailable Key strategies to meeting SDG Goal   will be to reduce adolescent pregnancy which is strongly linked to gender equality provide better data for all women and girls and achieve universal coverage of skilled birth attendants   Similarly progress has been made on increasing access to clean water and sanitation and reducing malaria tuberculosis polio and the spread of HIV/AIDS From 2000-2016 new HIV infections declined by   percent for children under   and by   percent among adolescents aged 15-19   However current trends mean 1/4 of countries still won't meet the SDG target to end AIDS among children under   and 3/4 will not meet the target to end AIDS among adolescents   Additionally only half of women in developing countries have received the health care they need and the need for family planning is increasing exponentially as the population grows While needs are being addressed gradually more than   million women have an unmet need for contraception Goal   aims to achieve universal health coverage to include access to essential medicines and vaccines   By   it proposes to end preventable death of newborns and children under   and end epidemics such as AIDS tuberculosis malaria and water-borne diseases for example     rates for the third dose of the pertussis vaccine DTP3 and the first dose of the measles vaccine MCV1 reached   percent and   percent respectively yet about   million children did not receive DTP3 and about   million did not receive MCV1   Around   in   countries will need to accelerate progress in order to reach SDG targets for immunization   Attention to health and well-being also includes targets related to the prevention and treatment of substance abuse deaths and injuries from traffic incidents and from hazardous chemicals and air water and soil pollution and contamination   Goal   Quality Education edit \"Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all \"   edit Major progress has been made in access to education specifically at the primary school level for both boys and girls Still At least   million children will miss out on pre-primary education unless the rate of progress doubles in   countries   Access does not always mean quality of education or completion of primary school   million youth worldwide still lack basic literacy skills and more than 60% of those are women More than half of children failed to meet minimum math proficiency standards at the end of primary school in   in   countries and at the lower secondary level in   in   countries   Target   of Goal   is to ensure that by   all girls and boys complete free equitable and quality primary and secondary education Additionally progress is difficult to track 3/4 of countries have no or insufficient data to track progress towards SDG Goal   targets for learning outcomes target   early childhood education target   and effective learning environments   Data on learning outcomes and pre-primary school are particularly scarce 70% and 40% of countries lack adequate data for these targets respectively   This makes it hard to analyze and identify the children at greatest risk of being left behind Goal   Gender Equality edit The logo of the United Nations entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women \"Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls \"   edit According to the UN \"gender equality is not only a fundamental human right but a necessary foundation for a peaceful prosperous and sustainable world \"   Providing women and girls with equal access to education health care decent work and representation in political and economic decision-making processes will fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large A record   countries guaranteed equality between men and women in their Constitutions as of   However another   had not taken this step In many nations gender discrimination is still woven into the fabric of legal systems and social norms Even though SDG5 is a stand-alone goal other SDGs can only be achieved if the needs of women receive the same attention as the needs of men Issues unique to women and girls include sex trafficking sexual exploitation traditional practices against all women and girls in the public and private spheres such as forced marriage and female genital mutilation Child marriage has declined over the past decades yet there is no region that is currently track to eliminate the practice and reach SDG targets by     If current trends continue between   and     million girls will be married before they turn     Though child marriages are four times higher among the poorest than the wealthiest in the world most countries need to accelerate progress among both groups in order to reach the SDG Goal   target to eliminate child marriage by     Achieving gender equality will require enforceable legislation that promotes empowerment of all women and girls and requires secondary education for all girls   The targets call for an end to gender discrimination and empowering women and girls through technology   Some have advocated for \"listening to girls\" The assertion is that the SDGs can deliver transformative change for girls only if girls are consulted Their priorities and needs must be taken into account Girls should be viewed not as beneficiaries of change but as agents of change Engaging women and girls in the implementation of the SDGs is crucial   The World Pensions Council WPC has insisted on the transformational role gender-diverse boards can play in that regard predicting that   could be a pivotal year as more than ever before many UK and European Union pension trustees speak enthusiastically about flexing their fiduciary muscles for the UN s Sustainable Development Goals including SDG5 and to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls   Goal   Clean Water and Sanitation edit Example of sanitation for all School toilet IPH school and college Mohakhali Dhaka Bangladesh Unimproved sanitation example pit latrine without slab in Lusaka Zambia \"Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all \"   edit   Sustainable Development Goal   The Sustainable Development Goal Number   SDG6 has eight targets and   indicators that will be used to monitor progress toward the targets Most are to be achieved by the year   One is targeted for     The first three targets relate to drinking water supply and sanitation   Worldwide   out of   people lack safely managed sanitation services and   out of   lack safely managed water services   Safe drinking water and hygienic toilets protect people from disease and enable societies to be more productive economically Attending school and work without disruption is critical to successful education and successful employment Therefore toilets in schools and work places are specifically mentioned as a target to measure \"Equitable sanitation\" is called for and calls for addressing the specific needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations such as the elderly or people with disabilities Water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented Ending open defecation will require provision of toilets and sanitation for     billion people as well as behavior change of the users   This will require cooperation between governments civil society and the private sector   The main indicator for the sanitation target is the \"Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services including a hand-washing facility with soap and water\"   However as of   2/3 of countries lacked baseline estimates for SDG indicators on hand washing safely managed drinking water and sanitation services   From those that were available the Joint Monitoring Programme JMP found that     billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation   If we are to meet SDG targets for sanitation by   nearly 1/3 of countries will need to accelerate progress to end open defecation including Brazil China Ethiopia India Indonesia Nigeria and Pakistan   The Sustainable Sanitation Alliance SuSanA has made it its mission to achieve SDG6     SuSanA's position is that the SDGs are highly interdependent Therefore the provision of clean water and sanitation for all is a precursor to achieving many of the other SDGs   Goal   Affordable and Clean Energy edit \"Ensure access to affordable reliable sustainable and modern energy for all \"   edit Targets for   include access to affordable and reliable energy while increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix This would involve improving energy efficiency and enhancing international cooperation to facilitate more open access to clean energy technology and investment in clean energy infrastructure Plans call for particular attention to infrastructure support for the least developed countries small islands and land-locked developing countries   As of   only 57% of the global population relies primarily on clean fuels and technology falling short of the 95% target   Goal   Decent Work and Economic Growth edit \"Promote sustained inclusive and sustainable economic growth full and productive employment and decent work for all \"   edit World Pensions Council WPC development economists have argued that the twin considerations of long-term economic growth and infrastructure investment weren t prioritized enough Being prioritized as number   and number   respectively was considered a rather \"mediocre ranking and defies common sense \"   Attaining at least 7% gross domestic product GDP annually in the least developed countries is the economic target Achieving higher productivity will require diversity and upgraded technology along with innovation entrepreneurship and the growth of small- and medium-sized enterprises SMEs Some targets are for   others are for   By   the target is to reduce youth unemployment and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment Implementing the Global Jobs Pact of the International Labour Organization is also mentioned By   the target is to establish policies for sustainable tourism that will create jobs Strengthening domestic financial institutions and increasing Aid for Trade support for developing countries is considered essential to economic growth The Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries is mentioned as a method for achieving sustainable economic growth   Goal   Industry Innovation and Infrastructure edit \"Build resilient infrastructure promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation \"   edit Manufacturing is a major source of employment In   the least developed countries had less \"manufacturing value added per capita\" The figure for Europe and North America amounted to US$4   compared to about $100 in the least developed countries   The manufacturing of high products contributes 80% to total manufacturing output in industrialized economies and barely 10% in the least developed countries Mobile-cellular signal coverage has improved a great deal In previously \"unconnected\" areas of the globe 85% of people live in covered areas Planet-wide 95% of the population is covered   Goal   Reduced Inequalities edit \"Reduce income inequality within and among countries \"   edit One target is to reduce the cost of exporting goods from least developed countries \"Duty-free treatment\" has expanded As of   65% of products coming from the least developed countries were duty-free as compared to 41% in   The target of 3% was established as the cost international migrant workers would pay to send money home known as remittances However post offices and money transfer companies charge 6% of the amount remitted Worse commercial banks charge 11% Prepaid cards and mobile money companies charge 2-4% but those services were not widely available as of   in typical \"remittance corridors \"   Goal   Sustainable Cities and Communities edit \"Make cities and human settlements inclusive safe resilient and sustainable \"   edit The target for   is to ensure access to safe and affordable housing The indicator named to measure progress toward this target is the proportion of urban population living in slums or informal settlements Between   and   the proportion fell from 39% to 30% However the absolute number of people living in slums went from   million in   to an estimated   million in   Movement from rural to urban areas has accelerated as the population has grown and better housing alternatives are available   Goal   Responsible Consumption and Production edit \"Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns \"   edit Using eco-friendly production methods and reducing the amount of waste we generate are targets of Goal   By   national recycling rates should increase as measured in tons of material recycled Further companies should adopt sustainable practices and publish sustainability reports Goal   Climate Action edit \"Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts by regulating emissions and promoting developments in renewable energy \"   edit The UN discussions and negotiations identified the links between the post-2015 SDG process and the Financing for Development process that concluded in Addis Ababa in July   and the COP   Climate Change conference in Paris in December     In May   a report concluded that only a very ambitious climate deal in Paris in   could enable countries to reach the sustainable development goals and targets   The report also states that tackling climate change will only be possible if the SDGs are met Further economic development and climate are inextricably linked particularly around poverty gender equality and energy The UN encourages the public sector to take initiative in this effort to minimize negative impacts on the environment   This renewed emphasis on climate change mitigation was made possible by the partial Sino-American convergence that developed in 2015-2016 notably at the UN COP21 summit Paris and ensuing G20 conference Hangzhou   As one of the most vulnerable regions to the unprecedented effects of climate change the Asia-Pacific region needs more Public-Private Partnerships PPPs to successfully implement its sustainable development initiatives   Goal   Life Below Water edit \"Conserve and sustainably use the oceans seas and marine resources for sustainable development \"   edit Oceans cover 71% of the earth's surface They are essential for making the planet livable Rainwater drinking water and climate are all regulated by ocean temperatures and currents Over   billion people depend on marine life for their livelihood Oceans absorb 30% of all carbon dioxide produced by humans   full citation needed The oceans contain more than     identified species and there might be thousands of species that are yet to be discovered Oceans are the world's largest sources of protein However there has been a 26% increase in acidification since the industrial revolution A full 30% of marine habitats have been destroyed and 30% of the world's fish stocks are over-exploited   full citation needed Marine pollution has reached shocking levels each minute   tons of plastic are released into the oceans   full citation needed 20% of all coral reefs have been destroyed irreversibly and another 24% are at an immediate risk of collapse   full citation needed Approximately   million sea birds     marine mammals and an unknown number of fish are harmed or die annually due to marine pollution caused by humans It has been found that 95% of fulmars in Norway have plastic parts in their guts   full citation needed Microplastics are another form of marine pollution Reducing one's energy consumption and use of plastics can be done by individuals Nations can also take action In Norway for instance citizens can work through a web page called finn no to be paid for picking up plastic on the beach   Several countries including Kenya have banned the use of plastic bags for retail purchases   Improving the oceans contributes to poverty reduction as it gives low-income families a source of income and healthy food Keeping beaches and ocean water clean in less developed countries can attract tourism as stated in Goal   and reduce poverty by providing more employment   full citation needed The targets include preventing and reducing marine pollution and acidification protecting marine and coastal ecosystems and regulating fishing The targets also call for an increase in scientific knowledge of the oceans     Goal   Life on Land edit \"Protect restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems sustainably manage forests combat desertification and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss \"   edit This goal articulates targets for preserving biodiversity of forest desert and mountain eco-systems as a percentage of total land mass Achieving a \"land degradation-neutral world\" can be reached by restoring degraded forests and land lost to drought and flood Goal   calls for more attention to preventing invasion of alien species and more protection of endangered wildlife   The Mountain Green Cover Index monitors progress toward target     which focuses on preserving mountain ecosystems The index is named as the indicator for target       Similarly the Red Index Red List Index or RLI will fill the monitoring function for biodiversity goals by documenting the trajectory of endangered species   Goal   Peace Justice and Strong Institutions edit \"Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development provide access to justice for all and build effective accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels \"   edit Reducing violent crime sex trafficking forced labor and child abuse are clear global goals The international community values peace and justice and calls for stronger judicial systems that will enforce laws and work toward a more peaceful and just society By   the UN could report progress on detecting victims of trafficking More women and girls than men and boys were victimized yet the share of women and girls has slowly declined In   84% of victims were females and by   that number had dropped to 71% Sexual exploitation numbers have declined but forced labor has increased One target is to see the end to sex trafficking forced labor and all forms of violence against and torture of children However reliance on the indicator of \"crimes reported\" makes monitoring and achieving this goal challenging   For instance 84% of countries have no or insufficient data on violent punishment of children   Of the data available it is clear that violence against children by their caregivers remains pervasive Nearly   in   children aged 1-14 are subjected to violent discipline on a regular basis regardless of income and no country is on track to eliminate violent discipline by     SDG   also targets universal legal identity and birth registration ensuring the right to a name and nationality civil rights recognition before the law and access to justice and social services With more than a quarter of children under   unregistered worldwide as of   about   in   countries will need to accelerate progress to achieve universal birth registration by     Goal   Partnerships for the Goals edit \"Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development \"   edit Increasing international cooperation is seen as vital to achieving each of the   previous goals Goal   is included to assure that countries and organizations cooperate instead of compete Developing multi-stakeholder partnerships to share knowledge expertise technology and financial support is seen as critical to overall success of SDGs Public-private partnerships that involve civil societies are specifically mentioned   Criticisms edit Competing goals edit   food vs fuel The SDGs might be contradictory For example seeking high levels of global GDP growth might undermine ecological objectives Similarly increasing employment and wages can work against reducing the cost of living Three sectors need to come together in order to achieve sustainable development These are the economic social and environmental sectors in their broadest sense   This requires the promotion of multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research across different sectors which can be difficult   Too many goals edit A commentary in The Economist in   argued that   targets for the SDGs is too many describing them as \"sprawling misconceived\" and \"a mess\" compared to the MDGs   The goals are said to ignore local context All other   goals might be contingent on achieving SDG   ending poverty which should have been at the top of a very short list of goals On the other hand nearly all stakeholders engaged in negotiations to develop the SDGs agreed that the high number of   goals were justified because the agenda they address is all encompassing High cost of achieving the SDGs edit The Economist estimated that alleviating poverty and achieving the other sustainable development goals will require about $2-$3 trillion USD per year for the next   years which they called \"pure fantasy\"   Estimates for providing clean water and sanitation for the whole population of all continents have been as high as US$200 billion   The World Bank cautions that estimates need to be made country by country and reevaluated frequently over time   Responses to criticisms edit Other views are more positive The SDGs were an outcome from a UN conference that was not criticized by any major non-governmental organization NGO Instead the SDGs received broad support from many NGOs citation needed This is unlike the MDGs which were strongly criticized by many NGOs as only dealing with the problems in contrast the SDGs deal with the causes of the problems The MDGs were about development while the SDGs are about sustainable development Finally the MDGs used a silo approach to problems while the SDGs take into account the inter-connectedness of all the problems citation needed Implementation edit A Boeing   of XiamenAir in Sustainable Development Goals livery in   Implementation of the SDGs started worldwide in   This process can also be called \"Localizing the SDGs\" All over the planet individual people universities governments and institutions and organizations of all kinds work on several goals at the same time   In each country governments must translate the goals into national legislation develop a plan of action establish budgets and at the same time be open to and actively search for partners Poor countries need the support of rich countries and coordination at the international level is crucial   The independent campaign \"Project Everyone\" has met some resistance     In addition several sections of civil society and governments felt the SDGs ignored \" sustainability \" even though it was the most important aspect of the agreement   A   study in the journal Nature found that while \"nearly all African countries demonstrated improvements for children under   years old for stunting wasting and underweight much if not all of the continent will fail to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target to end malnutrition by   \"   Europe and Russia edit Baltic nations via the Council of the Baltic Sea States have created the Baltic   Action Plan   The World Pensions Forum has observed that UK and European Union pension investors have been at the forefront of ESG-driven asset allocation at home and abroad and early adopters of SDG-centric investment practices   India edit The Government of India established the NITI Aayog to attain the sustainable development goals   In March   Haryana became the first state in India to have its annual budget focused on the attainment of SDG with a 3-year action plan and a 7-year strategy plan to implement sustainable development goals when Captain Abhimanyu Finance Minister of Government of Haryana unveiled a       million US$18 billion or   billion annual 2018-19 budget   Cross-cutting issues edit Women and gender equality edit There is widespread consensus that progress on all of the SDGs will be stalled if women's empowerment and gender equality is not prioritized holistically by policy makers as well as private sector executives and board members     Statements from diverse sources such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD UN Women and the World Pensions Forum have noted that investments in women and girls have positive impacts on economies National and global development investments often exceed their initial scope   Education and sustainable development edit   Education for sustainable development Education for sustainable development ESD is explicitly recognized in the SDGs as part of Target     of the SDG on education UNESCO promotes the Global Citizenship Education GCED as a complementary approach   At the same time it is important to emphasize ESD s importance for all the other   SDGs With its overall aim to develop cross-cutting sustainability competencies in learners ESD is an essential contribution to all efforts to achieve the SDGs This would enable individuals to contribute to sustainable development by promoting societal economic and political change as well as by transforming their own behavior   Education gender and technology edit   Massive open online course Massive open online courses MOOCs are free open education offered through online platforms The initial philosophy of MOOCs was to open up quality Higher Education to a wider audience As such MOOCs are an important tool to achieve Goal   \"Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\"   At the same time MOOCs also contribute to Goal   in that they are gender neutral and can give women and girls improved access to education   SDG-driven investment edit Capital stewardship is expected to play a crucial part in the progressive advancement of the SDG agenda No longer absentee landlords pension fund trustees have started to exercise more forcefully their governance prerogatives across the boardrooms of Britain Benelux and America coming together through the establishment of engaged pressure groups to shift the whole economic system towards sustainable investment   by using the SDG framework across all asset classes   History edit Further information Post-2015 Development Agenda and Millennium Development Goals UN SDG consultations in Mariupol Ukraine In   governments met in Stockholm Sweden for the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment to consider the rights of the family to a healthy and

the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\"   In   the first United Nations Conference on Environment and Development UNCED or Earth Summit was held in Rio de Janeiro where the first agenda for Environment and Development also known as Agenda   was developed and adopted In   the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development UNCSD also known as Rio+20 was held as a 20-year follow up to UNCED Colombia proposed the idea of the SDGs at a preparation event for Rio+20 held in Indonesia in July     In September   this idea was picked up by the United Nations Department of Public Information 64th NGO Conference in Bonn Germany The outcome document proposed   sustainable development goals and associated targets In the run-up to Rio+20 there was much discussion about the idea of the SDGs At the Rio+20 Conference a resolution known as \"The Future We Want\" was reached by member states   Among the key themes agreed on were poverty eradication energy water and sanitation health and human settlement The Rio+20 outcome document mentioned that at the outset the OWG Open Working Group will decide on its methods of work including developing modalities to ensure the full involvement of relevant stakeholders and expertise from civil society the scientific community and the United Nations system in its work in order to provide a diversity of perspectives and experience   In January   the 30-member UN General Assembly Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals was established to identify specific goals for the SDGs The Open Working Group OWG was tasked with preparing a proposal on the SDGs for consideration during the 68th session of the General Assembly September   September     On   July   the OWG forwarded a proposal for the SDGs to the Assembly After   sessions the OWG submitted their proposal of   SDGs and   targets to the 68th session of the General Assembly in September     On   December   the UN General Assembly accepted the Secretary General 's Synthesis Report which stated that the agenda for the post-2015 SDG process would be based on the OWG proposals   Society and culture edit A

science     navigation search Sustainability science has emerged in the 21st century as a new academic discipline   This new field of science was officially introduced with a \"Birth Statement\" at the World Congress \"Challenges of a Changing Earth 2001\" in Amsterdam organized by the International Council for Science ICSU the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme IGBP the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change   and the World Climate Research Programme WCRP The field reflects a desire to give the generalities and broad-based approach of sustainability a stronger analytic and scientific underpinning as it \"brings together scholarship and practice global and local perspectives from north and south and disciplines across the natural and social sciences engineering and medicine\"   Ecologist William C Clark proposes that it can be usefully thought of as \"neither 'basic' nor 'applied' research but as a field defined by the problems it addresses rather than by the disciplines it employs\" and that it \"serves the need for advancing both knowledge and action by creating a dynamic bridge between the two\"   The field is focused on examining the interactions between human environmental and engineered systems to understand and contribute to solutions for complex challenges that threaten the future of humanity and the integrity of the life support systems of the planet such as climate change biodiversity loss pollution and land and water degradation   Sustainability science like sustainability itself derives some impetus from the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science   Sustainability science provides a critical framework for sustainability   while sustainability measurement provides the evidence-based quantitative data needed to guide sustainability governance   Contents   Definition   Broad objectives     Knowledge structuring of issues     Coordination of data     Interdisciplinary approaches   Journals   List of sustainability science programs       References   Further reading Definition edit Consensual definition of sustainability science is as elusive as the definition of \"sustainability\" or \"sustainable development\" In an overview presented on its website in   the Sustainability Science Program at Harvard University described the field in the following way stressing its interdisciplinarity 'Sustainability science' is problem-driven interdisciplinary scholarship that seeks to facilitate the design implementation and evaluation of effective interventions that foster shared prosperity and reduced poverty while protecting the environment It is defined by the problems it addresses rather than the disciplines it employs It thus draws as needed from multiple disciplines of the natural social medical and engineering sciences from the professions and from the knowledge of practice   Susan W Kieffer and colleagues in   suggested more specifically that sustainability science is the cultivation integration and application of knowledge about Earth systems gained especially from the holistic and historical sciences such as geology ecology climatology oceanography coordinated with knowledge about human interrelationships gained from the social sciences and humanities in order to evaluate mitigate and minimize the consequences regionally and worldwide of human impacts on planetary systems and on societies across the globe and into the future that is in order that humans can be knowledgeable Earth stewards   It has been noted that the new paradigm must encompass different magnitudes of scales of time space and function multiple balances dynamics multiple actors interests and multiple failures systemic faults   Others take a much broader view of sustainability science emphasizing the need to analyze the root causes of the fundamental unsustainability of the prevailing economic system such as the emphasis on growth as key to solving political and social problems and advancing society's well-being In a   article entitled \"Sustainability Science Needs to Include Sustainable Consumption \" published in Environment Science and Policy for Sustainable Development Halina Brown argues that sustainability science must include the study of the sociology of material consumption and the structure of consumerist society the role of technology in aggravating the unsustainable social practices as well as in solving the problems they create the macroeconomic theories that presuppose economic growth as a necessary condition for advancing societal well-being and others   Broad objectives edit The case for making research and development an important component of sustainable development strategies was embraced by many international scientific organizations in the mid-1980s promoted by the Brundtland Commission's report Our Common Future in   and noted in the Agenda   plan that emerged from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in   and further developed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg in   The topics of the following sub-headings indicate recurring themes that are addressed in the literature of sustainability science   In   a compendium of basic papers in this new discipline was published as Readings in Sustainability Science and Technology edited by Robert Kates with a preface by William Clark   The   Commentary by Halina Brown extensively expands the scope of that seminal publication   This is work in progress The   Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology was created as a collaboration of over   scientists to provide peer-reviewed entries covering sustainability research and policy evaluations of technology   Knowledge structuring of issues edit Knowledge structuring has been identified as an essential first step in the effort to acquire a comprehensive view of sustainability issues which are both complex and interconnected This is needed as a response to the requirements of academia industry and government Coordination of data edit The key research and data for sustainability are sourced from many scientific disciplines topics and organisations A major part of knowledge structuring will entail building up the tools that provide an overview of what is known Sustainability science can construct and coordinate a framework within which the vast amount of data can be easily accessed Interdisciplinary approaches edit The attempt by sustainability science to understand the integrated whole of planetary and human systems requires cooperation between scientific social and economic disciplines public and private sectors academia and government In short it requires a massive global

navigation search Sustainable tourism is the concept of visiting a place as a tourist and trying to make only a positive impact on the environment society and economy   Tourism can involve primary transportation to the general location local transportation accommodations entertainment recreation nourishment and shopping It can be related to travel for leisure business and what is called VFR visiting friends and relatives   There is now broad consensus that tourism development should be sustainable however the question of how to achieve this remains an object of debate   Without travel there is no tourism so the concept of sustainable tourism is tightly linked to a concept of sustainable mobility   Two relevant considerations are tourism's reliance on fossil fuels and tourism's effect on climate change   percent of tourism's CO   emissions come from transportation   percent from accommodations and   percent from local activities   Aviation accounts for 55% of those transportation CO   emissions or 40% of tourism's total However when considering the impact of all greenhouse gas emissions from tourism and that aviation emissions are made at high altitude where their effect on climate is amplified aviation alone accounts for 75% of tourism's climate impact   The International Air Transport Association IATA considers an annual increase in aviation fuel efficiency of   percent per year through   to be realistic However both Airbus and Boeing expect the passenger-kilometers of air transport to increase by about   percent yearly through at least   overwhelming any efficiency gains By   with other economic sectors having greatly reduced their CO   emissions tourism is likely to be generating   percent of global carbon emissions   The main cause is an increase in the average distance travelled by tourists which for many years has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of trips taken         \"Sustainable transportation is now established as the critical issue confronting a global tourism industry that is palpably unsustainable and aviation lies at the heart of this issue Gossling et al   \"   Contents   Social & economic

economists forecast continuing international tourism growth the amount depending on the location As one of the world's largest and fastest growing industries this continuous growth will place great stress on remaining biologically diverse habitats and indigenous cultures which are often used to support mass tourism Tourists who promote sustainable tourism are sensitive to these dangers and seek to protect tourist destinations and to protect tourism as an industry Sustainable tourists can reduce the impact of tourism in many ways informing themselves of the culture politics and economy of the communities visited anticipating and respecting local cultures expectations and assumptions supporting the integrity of local cultures by favoring businesses which conserve cultural heritage and traditional values supporting local economies by purchasing local goods and participating with small local businesses conserving resources by seeking out businesses that are environmentally conscious and by using the least possible amount of non-renewable resources Increasingly destinations and tourism operations are endorsing and following \"responsible tourism\" as a pathway towards sustainable tourism Responsible tourism and sustainable tourism have an identical goal that of sustainable development The pillars of responsible tourism are therefore the same as those of sustainable tourism environmental integrity social justice and economic development The major difference between the two is that in responsible tourism individuals organizations and businesses are asked to take responsibility for their actions and the impacts of their actions This shift in emphasis has taken place because some stakeholders feel that insufficient progress towards realizing sustainable tourism has been made since the Earth Summit in Rio This is partly because everyone has been expecting others to behave in a sustainable manner The emphasis on responsibility in responsible tourism means that everyone involved in tourism government product owners and operators transport operators community services NGOs and Community-based organization CBOs tourists local communities industry associations are responsible for achieving the goals of responsible tourism Stakeholders edit Stakeholders of sustainable tourism play a role in continuing this form of tourism This can include organizations as well as individuals to be specific ECOFIN \"A stakeholder in the tourism industry is deemed to be anyone who is impacted on by development positively or negatively and as a result it reduces potential conflict between the tourists and host community by involving the latter in shaping the way in which tourism develops   The Global Sustainable Tourism Council GSTC serves as the international body for fostering increased knowledge and understanding of sustainable tourism practices promoting the adoption of universal sustainable tourism principles and building demand for sustainable travel It has a number of programmes including the setting of international standards for accreditation agencies the organisations that would inspect a tourism product and certify them as a sustainable company Governments edit The values and ulterior motives of governments often need to be taken into account when assessing the motives for sustainable tourism One important factor to consider in any ecologically sensitive or remote area or an area new to tourism is that of carrying capacity This is the capacity of tourists of visitors an area can sustainably tolerate without damaging the environment or culture of the surrounding area This can be altered and revised in time and with changing perceptions and values For example originally the sustainable carrying capacity of the Galapagos Islands was set at     visitors per annum but was later changed by the Ecuadorian government to     for economic reasons and objectives   Non-governmental organizations edit Non-governmental organizations are one of the stakeholders in advocating sustainable tourism Their roles can range from spearheading sustainable tourism practices to simply doing research University research teams and scientists can be tapped to aid in the process of planning Such solicitation of research can be observed in the planning of C t B National Park in Vietnam citation needed Dive resort operators in Bunaken National Park Indonesia play a crucial role by developing exclusive zones for diving and fishing respectively such that both tourists and locals can benefit from the venture citation needed Large conventions meetings and other major organized events drive the travel tourism and hospitality industry Cities and convention centers compete to attract such commerce commerce which has heavy impacts on resource use and the environment Major sporting events such as the Olympic Games present special problems regarding environmental burdens and degradation   But burdens imposed by the regular convention industry can be vastly more significant Green conventions and events are a new but growing sector and marketing point within the convention and hospitality industry More environmentally aware organizations corporations and government agencies are now seeking more sustainable event practices greener hotels restaurants and convention venues and more energy efficient or climate neutral travel and ground transportation citation needed However the convention trip not taken can be the most sustainable option \"With most international conferences having hundreds if not thousands of participants and the bulk of these usually traveling by plane conference travel is an area where significant reductions in air-travel-related GHG emissions could be made This does not mean non-attendance\" Reay   since modern Internet communications are now ubiquitous and remote audio/visual participation   For example by   Access Grid technology had already successfully hosted several international conferences   A particular example is the large American Geophysical Union's annual meeting which has used livestreaming for several years This provides live streams and recordings of keynotes named lectures and oral sessions and provides opportunities to submit questions and interact with authors and peers   Following the live-stream the recording of each session is posted on-line within   hours Some convention centers have begun to take direct action in reducing the impact of the conventions they host One example is the Moscone Center in San Francisco which has a very aggressive recycling program a large solar power system and other programs aimed at reducing impact and increasing efficiency citation needed Local Communities edit Local communities benefit from sustainable tourism through economic development job creation and infrastructure development Tourism revenues bring economic growth and prosperity to attractive tourist destinations which can raise the standard of living in destination communities Sustainable tourism operators commit themselves to creating jobs for local community members Increase in tourism revenue to an area acts as a driver for the development of increased infrastructure As tourist demands increase in a destination a more robust infrastructure is needed to support the needs of both the tourism industry and the local community   A   study of rural operators throughout the province of British Columbia Canada found \"an overall strong 'pro-sustainability' attitude among respondents Dominant barriers identified were lack of available money to invest lack of incentive programs other business priorities and limited access to suppliers of sustainable products with the most common recommendation being the need for incentive programs to encourage businesses to become more sustainable \"   Sustainable Tourism in Developing Nations edit Play media Sustainable tourism in Sierra Leone A story of community tourism Playlist Expansion of Tourism in the LEDCs edit The renewed emphasis on outward-orientated growth which accompanied the rise in neoliberal development strategies in the 1990s in the south also focused attention on international tourism as an import potential growth sector for many countries particularly in Less Economically Developed Countries LEDCs as many of the world's most beautiful and 'untouched' places are located in the Third World   Prior to the 1960s studies tended to assume that the extension of the tourism industry to LEDCs was a good thing In the 1970s this changed as academics started to take a much more negative view on tourism's consequences particularly criticising the industry as an effective contributor towards development International tourism is a volatile industry with visitors quick to abandon destinations that were formerly popular because of threats to health or security   Problems with sustainable tourism in the Third World edit Displacement and Resettlement edit One common issue with tourism in a place where there was none prior to First World companies arriving is that of the displacement and resettlement of local communities     The Maasai tribes in Tanzania have been a victim of this problem After the second World War First World conservationists with the intent of making such areas accessible to tourists as well as preserving the areas natural beauty and ecology moved into the areas where the Maasai tribes lived This was often achieved through the setting up of national parks and conservation areas Monbiot     Olerokonga       It has been claimed that Maasai activities did not threaten the wildlife and the First World knowledge was blurred by ' colonial disdain' and misunderstandings of savannah wildlife   As the Maasai have been displaced the area within the Ngorongoro Conservation Area NCA has been modified to allow easier access for tourists by actions such as building campsites tracks and the removal of stone objects such as stones for souvenirs   This kind of 'sustainable tourism' is viewed by many as an oxymoron or metaphor since it seriously can't change anything There basically isn't a way we can make tourism sustainable but if all tourists put their heads together and work hard it could possibly work in a viable world that many things done in the name of sustainability are actually masking the desire to allow extra profits   There is often alienation of local populations from the tourists   Environmental Impacts edit   environmental impact of tourism \"The environmental sustainability focuses on the overall viability and health of ecological systems Natural resource degradation pollution and loss of biodiversity are detrimental because they increase vulnerability undermine system health and reduce resilience This aspect of sustainability has been the most often discussed through the literature by numerous authors such as Hall C M & Lew A A   Hall D   Weaver   and many others \"   Coastal tourism edit Many coastal areas are experiencing particular pressure from growth in lifestyles and growing numbers of tourists Coastal environments are limited in extent consisting of only a narrow strip along the edge of the ocean Coastal areas are often the first environments to experience the detrimental impacts of tourism A detailed study of the impact on coastal areas with reference to western India can be an example   The inevitable change is on the horizon as holiday destinations put more effort into sustainable tourism   Planning and management controls can reduce the impact on coastal environments   and ensure that investment into tourism products supports sustainable coastal tourism   Some studies have led to interesting conceptual models applicable for coastal tourism The 'inverted funnel model' and the 'embedded model' Staju Jacob   can be metaphors for understanding the interplay of different stake-holders like government local community tourists and business community in developing tourist destinations   Mountain tourism edit Mount Everest attracts many tourist climbers wanting to summit the peak of the highest mountain in the world each year Everest is a UNESCO World Heritage site Over the years carelessness and excessive consumption of resources by mountaineers as well as overgrazing by livestock have damaged the habitats of snow leopards lesser pandas Tibetan bears and scores of bird species To counteract past abuses various reforestation programs have been carried out by local communities and the Nepalese government   Expeditions have removed supplies and equipment left by climbers on Everest s slopes including hundreds of oxygen containers A large quantity of the litter of past climbers tons of items such as tents cans crampons and human waste has been hauled down from the mountain and recycled or discarded However the bodies of most of the more than   climbers who have died on Everest notably on its upper slopes have not been removed as they are unreachable or for those that are accessible their weight makes carrying them down extremely difficult Notable in the cleanup endeavour have been the efforts of the Eco Everest Expeditions the first of which was organized in   to commemorate the death that January of Everest-climbing pioneer Sir Edmund Hillary Those expeditions also have publicized ecological issues in particular concerns about the effects of climate change in the region through observations that the Khumbu Icefall has been melting   Small Island tourism edit Small Islands are especially affected and often depend on tourism as this industry makes up anywhere from 40% to 75% of the GDP Gross Domestic Product for various islands including Barbados Aruba Isle of Man and Anguilla         Mass tourism tends to put a strain on fragile island ecosystems and the natural resources it provides Studies have shown that early practices of tourism were unsustainable and took a toll to environmental factors hurting the natural landscapes that originally drew in the tourists     For example in Barbados beaches are the main attraction and have been eroded and destroyed over the years This is due to inefficient political decisions and policies along with irresponsible tourist activity such as reckless diving and waste disposal damaging coastal and marine environments Such practices also altered physical features of the landscape and caused a loss in biodiversity leading to the disruption of ecosystems   Many other islands faced environmental damage such as Isle of Man and Samoa     However visitors are attracted to the less industrial scene of these islands   and according to a survey by Canavan over 80% of the people enjoyed the natural landscape when they visited many commenting that they wanted to protect and save the wildlife in the area   Many tourists have turned to practices of sustainable and eco tourism in attempt to save the nature they enjoy in these locations while some political entities try to enforce this in attempt to keep tourism in their island afloat     Sustainable Tourism as part of a development strategy edit Third World countries are especially interested in international tourism   and many believe it brings countries a large selection of economic benefits including employment opportunities small business development and increased in payments of foreign exchange Many assume that more money is gained through developing luxury goods and services in spite of the fact that this increases a countries dependency on imported products foreign investments and expatriate skills   This classic 'trickle down' financial strategy rarely makes its way down to brings its benefits down to small businesses   It has been said that the economic benefits of large-scale tourism are not doubted but that the backpacker or budget traveller sector is often neglected as a potential growth sector by Third World governments   This sector brings significant non-economic benefits which could help to empower and educate the communities involved in this sector \"Aiming 'low' builds upon the skills of the local population promotes self-reliance and develops the confidence of community members in dealing with outsiders all signs of empowerment\"   and all of which aid in the overall development of a nation Improvements to Sustainable Tourism in the Third World edit Management of Sustainable Tourism edit There has been the promotion of sustainable tourism practices surrounding the management of tourist locations by locals or the community This form of tourism is based on the premise that the people living next to a resource are the ones best suited to protecting it This means that the tourism activities and businesses are developed and operated by local community members and certainly with their consent and support Sustainable tourism typically involves the conservation of resources that are capitalized upon for tourism purposes Locals run the businesses and are responsible for promoting the conservation messages to protect their environment   Community-based sustainable tourism CBST associates the success of the sustainability of the ecotourism location to the management practices of the communities who are directly or indirectly dependent on the location for their livelihoods A salient feature of CBST is that local knowledge is usually utilised alongside wide general frameworks of ecotourism business models This allows the participation of locals at the management level and typically allows a more intimate understanding of the environment citation needed The use of local knowledge also means an easier entry level into a tourism industry for locals whose jobs or livelihoods are affected by the use of their environment as tourism locations Environmentally sustainable development crucially depends on the presence of local support for a project   It has also been noted that in order for success projects must provide direct benefits for the local community   However recent research has found that economic linkages generated by CBST may only be sporadic and that the linkages with agriculture are negatively affected by seasonality and by the small scale of the cultivated areas This means that CBST may only have small-scale positive effects for these communities   It has also been said that partnerships between governments and tourism agencies with smaller communities is not particularly effective because of the disparity in aims between the two groups i e true sustainability versus mass tourism for maximum profit In Honduras such a divergence can be demonstrated where consultants from the World Bank and officials from the Institute of tourism wanted to set up a selection of 5-star hotels near various ecotourism destinations But another operating approach in the region by USAID and APROECOH an ecotourism association promotes community-based efforts which has trained many local Hondurans Mader   concluded that the grassroot organisations were more successful in Honduras Confusion surrounding Governmental Management of Sustainable Tourism edit There has been some discussion regarding the told of inter-governmental organisations and the development of sustainable tourism practices in the third world In Mowforth and Munt's book 'Tourism and Sustainability New Tourism in the Third World they criticised a document that was written by the World Travel and Tourism Council WTTC the World Tourism Organisation and the Earth Council which was included in Agenda   It was entitled 'Agenda   for the Travel and Tourism Industry Towards Environmentally Sustainable Development' Mowforth and Munt commented on the language used to describe the environment and local culture in such documents because the preservation of the environment and local culture are the two main objectives when practising sustainable tourism They pointed out that some of the key words used were 'core asset' 'core product' 'product quality' and 'preserve'   They argued that the treatment of the environment as a marketable product was clear and that such documents provide a good list of advice for Third World governments regarding sustainable tourism but do not actually provide the resources to incorporate them into the development of their tourism industries   It is arguments such as these that postulate that there is a gap between the advice given by non-governmental or inter-governmental organisations to Third World governments and what can actually be brought to realisation These arguments try and persuade readers that documents like the one released by the WTTC that the development of sustainable tourism actually 'bypasses the interests of local people'   Responsible tourism edit Responsible tourism is regarded as a behaviour It is more than a form of tourism as it represents an approach to engaging with tourism be that as a tourist a business locals at a destination or any other tourism stakeholder It emphasizes that all stakeholders are responsible for the kind of tourism they develop or engage in Whilst different groups will see responsibility in different ways the shared understanding is that responsible tourism should entail an improvement in tourism Tourism should become better as a result of the responsible tourism approach   Within the notion of betterment resides the acknowledgement that conflicting interests need to be balanced However the objective is to create better places for people to live in and to visit Importantly there is no blueprint for responsible tourism what is deemed responsible may differ depending on places and cultures Responsible Tourism is an aspiration that can be realized in different ways in different originating markets and in the diverse destinations of the world Goodwin   citation needed Focusing in particular on businesses according to the Cape Town Declaration on Responsible Tourism it will have the following characteristics   minimises negative economic environmental and social impacts generates greater economic benefits for local people and enhances the well-being of host communities improves working conditions and access to the industry involves local people in decisions that affect their lives and life chances makes positive contributions to the conservation of natural and cultural heritage to the maintenance of the world s diversity provides more enjoyable experiences for tourists through more meaningful connections with local people and a greater understanding of local cultural social and environmental issues provides access for people with disabilities and is culturally sensitive engenders respect between tourists and hosts and builds local pride and confidence Sustainable tourism is where tourists can enjoy their holiday and at the same time respect the culture of people and also respect the environment It also means that local people such as the Masaai get a fair say about tourism and also receive some money from the profit which the game reserve make The environment is being damaged quite a lot by tourists and part of Sustainable tourism is to make sure that the damaging does not carry on citation needed There are many private companies who are working into embracing the principles and aspects of Responsible Tourism some for the purpose of Corporate Social Responsibility activities and others such as SustainableVisit responsibletravel com FairTravelR and WorldHotel-Link which was originally a project of the International Finance Corporation have built their entire business model around responsible tourism local capacity building and increasing market access for small and medium tourism enterprises citation needed Humane tourism edit Humane tourism is part of the movement of responsible tourism The idea is to empower local communities through travel related businesses around the world first and foremost in developing countries The idea of humane travel or humane tourism is to connect travelers from Europe North America Australia and New Zealand seeking new adventures and authentic experiences directly to local businesses in the specific locations they wish to visit thus giving economic advantages to local businesses and giving travelers authentic and truly unique travel experiences Humane travel or humane tourism focuses on the people the local community The idea is to enable travelers to experience the world through the eyes of its local people while contributing directly to those people ensuring that tourist dollars benefit the local community directly citation needed Humane tourism is about giving opportunity to the local people empower them enable them to enjoy the fruits of tourism directly The Internet is changing tourism More and more travelers are planning their travels and vacations via the net The Internet enables people to cut off commissions The traveler can search for new destinations to visit talk or read about other people experience and buy the services directly The Internet platform can encourage local people to start new businesses and that already existing small businesses will begin to promote themselves through the net and receive the economic advantages of this directly in their communities The world is now in a new tourism age with globalization and the Internet playing a key role citation needed The new travelers have traveled the world they have seen the classic sites Staying at a Western hotel is not attractive enough and they are excited by the prospect of experiencing the authentic local way of life to go fishing with a local fisherman to eat the fish with his family to sleep in a typical village house These tourists or travelers are happy to know that while doing so they promote the economic well-being of those same people they spend time with citation needed Humane tourism is part of Responsible tourism The concept of Responsible Tourism originated in the work of Jost Krippendorf in The Holiday Makers   called for rebellious tourists and rebellious locals to create new forms of tourism His vision was to develop and promote new forms of tourism which will bring the greatest possible benefit to all the participants travelers the host population and the tourist business without causing intolerable ecological and social damage As one can see he already talked back in the 80s about benefits for the host population and used the term human tourism Humane travel focuses on that host local population The South African national tourism policy     used the term \"responsible tourism\" and mentioned the well-being of the local community as a main factor   The Cape Town Declaration on Responsible Tourism in Destinations   agreed in   that Responsible Tourism is about making better places for people to live in and better places for people to visit The declaration focused on \"places\" but did mention the local population From the Rio summit or earth summit on     until the UN Commission on Sustainable Development in     the main focus of the tourism industry was the earth the planet the places \"green\" or \"eco\" tourism Now there is a trend to include the local population This trend or branch of responsible tourism is called humane tourism or humane travel Responsible hospitality edit As with the view of responsible tourism responsible hospitality is essentially about creating better places for people to live in and better places for people to visit This does not mean all forms of hospitality are also forms of tourism although hospitality is the largest sector of the tourism industry As such we should not be surprised at overlaps between responsible hospitality and responsible tourism In the instance where place of permanent residence is also the place where the hospitality service is consumed if for example a meal is consumed in a local restaurant this does not obviate the requirement to improve the place of residence As such the essence of Responsible Hospitality is not contingent upon touristic forms of hospitality citation needed While Friedman     famously argued that admittedly within legal parameters the sole responsibility of business was to generate profit for shareholders the idea that businesses responsibility extends beyond this has existed for decades and is most frequently encountered in the concept of corporate social responsibility   There are numerous ways businesses can and do engage in activities that are not intended to benefit shareholders and management at least not in the short term However often acts of corporate social responsibility are undertaken because of the perceived benefit to business Usually in hospitality this relates to the cost reductions associated with improved energy efficiency   but may also relate to for example the rise in ethical consumerism and the view that being seen to be a responsible business is beneficial to revenue growth As per the Cape Town Declaration on Responsible Tourism responsible hospitality is culturally sensitive Instead of then calling for the unachievable responsible hospitality simply makes the case for more responsible forms of hospitality hospitality that benefits locals first and visitors second Certainly all forms of hospitality can be improved and managed so that negative impacts are minimized whilst striving for a maximization of positive impacts on the environment Hospitality Education edit Ministry of Tourism Government of India has mentioned that some of the hospitality management/ culinary training institutes in India will no longer make it mandatory for students to engage in non-vegetarian cooking The student will be given an option to choose vegetarian cooking IHMCTAN Ahmedabad IHMCTAN Bhopal and IHMCTAN Jaipur are the hospitality training institutes that offer a vegetarian choice and this

late David Willey and others concerned about population numbers and sustainability They were impelled to act by the failure of United Kingdom governments to respond to a series of recommendations regarding population growth and sustainability   The Optimum Population Trust prepared analyses and lobbied on issues affected by population growth It also lobbied developmental and environmental campaigners on the need to incorporate population issues in their thinking It was granted charitable status on   May     Population Matters was adopted as its campaign name in     Views and aims edit Population Matters aims to achieve a future with decent living standards for all a healthy and biodiverse environment and a sustainable population size   The charity holds the following policy positions Population edit Population growth increases damage to the environment and depletes natural resources Therefore human numbers should be reduced voluntarily to a sustainable level that enables an acceptable quality of life for all Given that human activity already exceeds Earth s capacity to support it Population Matters argues that population stabilisation should be strived for without delay   The United Nations projects that global population size could grow by     billion between   and   which illustrates the urgency of the matter further according to the organisation   Development and climate change edit Population growth increases the number of wealthy carbon emitters and poorer climate change victims and hampers mitigation and adaptation efforts In   humanity used the sustainable resource output of     Earths   Evidence has been presented that less equal affluent countries consume more resources and generate more waste than other affluent countries   Consequently Population Matters supports greater income equality Developed countries are responsible for the majority of resource consumption as well as the associated global environmental degradation Therefore the developed world has a responsibility to support developing nations according to the organisation   Population Matters supports the concept of Contraction and Convergence as conceived by the Global Commons Institute   Women s rights and reproductive health edit Women s empowerment and gender equality are essential for reproductive health economic development and population stabilisation Population Matters therefore supports programmes to improve the status of women Population Matters embraces the Sustainable Development Goals that see women s empowerment as a necessary condition for sustainable development   Comparisons made between developing nations that experienced rapid fertility decline and those that did not found that high fertility increases absolute levels of poverty by slowing economic growth and worsening the distribution of additionally acquired resources   Consequently the organisation promotes policies improving access to contraceptives Migration edit Migration often results from conflict poverty inequality or population and consumption pressures Population Matters calls for fair trade terms and increased foreign aid and knowledge transfer to promote sustainable development global justice and resilience Population Matters believes that the only just and long-term solution to migration pressure is to address its underlying causes in the countries of origin such as poverty lack or over exploitation of resources climate change and conflict   The organisation believes that developed countries have a moral responsibility to help with this because they contribute to migratory pressures by being both major consumers of resources from developing countries and are the principal source of the causes of climate change   Ageing and parenthood edit Population Matters rejects the case that more young people are required to care for an increasing number of elderly It believes that governments should promote responsible parenthood and limit subsidies to the first two children unless a family is living in poverty Population Matters promotes the idea that society should deal with ageing by enabling employment for untrained underemployed and older people and by optimising the use of technology     Activities edit Population Matters campaigns to stabilise population at a sustainable level through encouraging a culture shift towards smaller family sizes worldwide and improving resources for women's empowerment and family planning in lower income countries     Over the years the organization has supported various campaigns including Caroline Lucas Bill to make Personal Social Health and Economic education PSHE a statutory requirement in state-funded schools   It also produces material to help its supporters raise awareness of population growth   The charity also runs Empower to Plan a crowdfunding project that offers members of the public the opportunity to donate directly towards family planning and women's empowerment projects around the world   Other activities include the Population Matters Overshoot Index which presents assessments of the extent to which countries and regions of the world are

This perspective renders the industrial revolution as a whole unsustainable It has also been argued that the meaning of the concept has opportunistically been stretched from \"conservation

Marble photograph taken from Apollo   on   December   quickly became an icon of environmental conservation     Sustainability can be defined as the practice of maintaining processes of productivity

concern for the carrying capacity of natural systems with the social political and economic challenges faced by humanity Sustainability science is the study of the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science There is an additional focus on the present generations' responsibility to regenerate maintain and improve planetary resources for use by future generations   3-8 Sustainable development has its roots in ideas about sustainable forest management which were developed in Europe during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries     6-16 In response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England John Evelyn argued that \"sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources\" in his   essay Sylva In   Hans Carl von Carlowitz a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector Frederick Augustus I of Saxony published Sylvicultura oeconomica a 400-page work on forestry Building upon the ideas of Evelyn and French minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for sustained yield   His work influenced others including Alexander von Humboldt and Georg Ludwig Hartig eventually leading to the development of a science of forestry This in turn influenced people like Gifford Pinchot first head of the US Forest Service whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources and Aldo Leopold whose land ethic was influential in the development of the environmental movement in the 1960s     Following the publication of Rachel Carson 's Silent Spring in   the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation Kenneth E Boulding in his influential   essay The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources   One of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the Club of Rome in   in its classic report on the Limits to Growth written by a group of scientists led by Dennis and Donella Meadows of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Describing the desirable \"state of global equilibrium\" the authors wrote \"We are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people \"   In   the International Union for the Conservation of Nature published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority   and introduced the term \"sustainable development\"     Two years later the United Nations World Charter for Nature raised five principles of conservation by which human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged   In   the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development released the report Our Common Future commonly called the Brundtland Report The report included what is now one of the most widely recognised definitions of sustainable development     Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs It contains within it two key concepts The concept of 'needs' in particular the essential needs of the world's poor to which overriding priority should be given and The idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs World Commission on Environment and Development Our Common Future   Since the Brundtland Report the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of \"socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth\"     In   the UN Conference on Environment and Development published the Earth Charter which outlines the building of a just sustainable and peaceful global society in the 21st century The action plan Agenda   for sustainable development identified information integration and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars It emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information It stresses the need to change from old sector-centered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross-sectoral co-ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes Furthermore Agenda   emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development   Under the principles of the United Nations Charter the Millennium Declaration identified principles and treaties on sustainable development including economic development social development and environmental protection Broadly defined sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural produced and social capital for the welfare of their own and future generations The term sustainable development as

constituent parts   Sustainable development or sustainability has been described in terms of three spheres dimensions domains or pillars i e the environment the economy and society The three-sphere framework was initially proposed by the economist Ren Passet in     It has also been worded as \"economic environmental and social\" or \"ecology economy and equity\"   This has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture institutions or governance   or alternatively reconfigured as four domains of the social - ecology economics politics and culture   thus bringing economics back inside the social and treating ecology as the intersection of the social and the natural   Environmental or ecological edit   Ecological engineering Relationship between ecological footprint and Human Development Index HDI The ecological stability of human settlements is part of the relationship between humans and their natural social and built environments   Also termed human ecology this broadens the focus of sustainable development to include the domain of human health Fundamental human needs such as the availability and quality of air water food and shelter are also the ecological foundations for sustainable development   addressing public health risk through investments in ecosystem services can be a powerful and transformative force for sustainable development which in this sense extends to all species   Environmental sustainability concerns the natural environment and how it endures and remains diverse and productive Since natural resources are derived from the environment the state of air water and the climate are of particular concern The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report outlines current knowledge about scientific technical and socio-economic information concerning climate change and lists options for adaptation and mitigation   Environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet This for example entails using water sustainably utilizing renewable energy and sustainable material supplies e g harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity citation needed An unsustainable situation occurs when natural capital the sum total of nature's resources is used up faster than it can be replenished Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity Theoretically the long-term result of environmental degradation is the inability to sustain human life Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support citation needed If the degradation continues beyond a certain tipping point or critical threshold it would lead to eventual extinction for humanity citation needed Consumption of non-renewable resources State of environment Sustainability More than nature's ability to replenish Environmental degradation Not sustainable Equal to nature's ability to replenish Environmental equilibrium Steady state economy Less than nature's ability to replenish Environmental renewal Environmentally sustainable Integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities A telling example is the European environmental research and innovation policy which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme Horizon   which is also open to participation worldwide   A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible     Pollution of the public resources is really not a different action it just is a reverse tragedy of the commons in that instead of taking something out something is put into the commons When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed then it becomes only natural to pollute as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons So the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it through taxes or fines more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge   So one can try to appeal to the ethics of the situation by doing the right thing as an individual but in the absence of any direct consequences the individual will tend to do what is best for the person and not what is best for the common good of the public Once again this issue needs to be addressed Because left unaddressed the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way So this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use Agriculture edit   Sustainable agriculture Sustainable agriculture consists of environment friendly methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems It involves preventing adverse effects to soil water biodiversity surrounding or downstream resources as well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighboring areas The concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally passing on a conserved or improved natural resource biotic and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted   Elements of sustainable agriculture include permaculture agroforestry mixed farming multiple cropping and crop rotation   It involves agricultural methods that do not undermine the environment smart farming technologies that enhance a quality environment for humans to thrive and reclaiming and transforming deserts into farmlands Herman Daly   citation needed Numerous sustainability standards and certification systems exist including organic certification Rainforest Alliance Fair Trade UTZ

economics It has been suggested that because of rural poverty and overexploitation environmental resources should be treated as important economic assets called natural capital   Economic development has traditionally required a growth in the gross domestic product This model of unlimited personal and GDP growth may be over   Sustainable development may involve improvements in the quality of life for many but may necessitate a decrease in resource consumption   According to ecological economist Malte Faber ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature justice and time Issues of intergenerational equity irreversibility of environmental change uncertainty of long-term outcomes and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation   As early as the 1970s the concept of sustainability was used to describe an economy \"in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems\"   Scientists in many fields have highlighted The Limits to Growth     and economists have presented alternatives for example a ' steady-state economy '   to address concerns over the impacts of expanding human development on the planet In   the economist Edward Barbier published the study The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development where he recognised that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other   A World Bank study from   concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability in macroeconomics or purely environmental   Several studies have noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare eventually reaching a golden-rule steady state         The study Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms found three pillars of sustainable development interlinkage intergenerational equity and dynamic efficiency   But Gilbert Rist points out that the World Bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem He writes \"From this angle 'sustainable development' looks like a cover-up operation The thing that is meant to be sustained is really 'development' not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies \"   The World Bank a leading producer of environmental knowledge continues to advocate the win-win prospects for economic growth and ecological stability even as its economists express their doubts   Herman Daly an economist for the Bank from   to   writes When authors of WDR '92 the highly influential   World Development Report that featured the environment were drafting the report they called me asking for examples of \"win-win\" strategies in my work What could I say? None exists in that pure form there are trade-offs not \"win-wins \" But they want to see a world of \"win-wins\" based on articles of faith not fact I wanted to contribute because WDR s are important in the Bank because task managers read them to find philosophical justification for their latest round of projects But they did not want to hear about how things really are or what I find in my work \"   A meta review in   looked at environmental and economic valuations and found a lack of \"sustainability policies\"   A study in   asked if we consume too much   A study concluded in   that knowledge manufactured and human capital health and education has not compensated for the degradation of natural capital in many parts of the world   It has been suggested that intergenerational equity can be incorporated into a sustainable development and decision making as has become common in economic valuations of climate economics   A meta review in   identified conditions for a strong case to act on climate change and called for more work to fully account of the relevant economics and how it affects human welfare   According to free-market environmentalist John Baden \"the improvement of environment quality depends on the market economy and the existence of legitimate and protected property rights\" They enable the effective practice of personal responsibility and the development of mechanisms to protect the environment The State can in this context \"create conditions which encourage the people to save the environment\"   Misum Mistra Center for Sustainable

Consumption and Sustainable Socio-Economic Development   Environmental economics edit   Environmental economics The total environment includes not just the biosphere of earth air and water but also human interactions with these things with nature and what humans have created as their surroundings   As countries around the world continue to advance economically they put a strain on the ability of the natural environment to absorb the high level of pollutants that are created as a part of this economic growth Therefore solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow but not at the expense of the public good In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource This is a resource to be protected One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited   Benefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis citation needed Energy edit Main articles Smart grid and Sustainable energy Sustainable energy is clean and can be used over a long period of time Unlike fossil fuels and biofuels that provide the bulk of the worlds energy renewable energy sources like hydroelectric solar and wind energy produce far less pollution     Solar energy is commonly used on public parking meters street lights and the roof of buildings   Wind power has expanded quickly its share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of   was   1%   Most of California's fossil fuel infrastructures are sited in or near low-income communities and have traditionally suffered the most from California's fossil fuel energy system These communities are historically left out during the decision-making process and often end up with dirty power plants and other dirty energy projects that poison the air and harm the area These toxicants are major contributors to health problems in the communities As renewable energy becomes more common fossil fuel infrastructures are replaced by renewables providing better social equity to these communities   Overall and in the long run sustainable development in the field of energy is also deemed to contribute to economic sustainability and national security of communities thus being increasingly encouraged through investment policies   Manufacturing edit Main article Green manufacturing and Distributed manufacturing Technology edit   Appropriate technology Environmental engineering and Environmental technology One of the core concepts in sustainable development is that technology can be used to assist people meet their developmental needs Technology to meet these sustainable development needs is often referred to as appropriate technology which is an ideological movement and its manifestations originally articulated as intermediate technology by the economist E F Schumacher in his influential work Small is Beautiful and now covers a wide range of technologies   Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasise the technology as people-centered   Today appropriate technology is often developed using open source principles which have led to open-source appropriate technology OSAT and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the Internet   OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for sustainable development     Transport edit   Sustainable transport Transportation is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions It is said that one-third of all gasses produced are due to transportation   Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change   Sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development According to a series of reports by the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership LEDS GP sustainable transport can help create jobs   improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways   make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient It also offers a practical opportunity to save people's time and household income as well as government budgets   making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity Some Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations   An example is the modification in available transportation in Freiburg Germany The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation cycling and walking along with large areas where cars are not allowed   Since many Western countries are highly automobile-oriented the main transit that people use is personal vehicles About 80% of their travel involves cars   Therefore California is one of the highest greenhouse gases emitters in the United States The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips in order to lower greenhouse gases emission Such as Improve public transit through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network   Encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway bike share stations in downtowns locate parking lots far from the shopping center limit on street parking slower traffic lane in downtown area Increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles This can produce a social equity problem since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities   Other states and nations have built efforts to translate knowledge in behavioral economics into evidence-based sustainable transportation policies citation needed Business edit   Corporate sustainability The most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firm's efficient use of natural capital This eco-efficiency is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact   This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development WBCSD under the following definition \"Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life while progressively reducing ecological impacts and resource intensity throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity\" DeSimone and Popoff       Similar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability Socio-efficiency   describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact Whereas it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees this is not true for social impacts These can be either positive e g corporate giving creation of employment or negative e g work accidents mobbing of employees human rights abuses Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts i e accidents per value added or maximise positive social impacts i e donations per value added in relation to the value added citation needed Both eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations However as Dyllick and Hockerts   point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development They point towards eco-effectiveness socio-effectiveness sufficiency and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached citation needed CASI Global New York \"CSR & Sustainability together lead to sustainable development CSR as in corporate social responsibility is not what you do with your profits but is the way you make profits This means CSR is a part of every department of the company value chain and not a part of HR / independent department Sustainability as in effects towards Human

social teaching can reduce poverty While over many thousands of years the 'stronger' economically or physically overcame the weaker nowadays for various reasons Catholic social teaching social solidarity sustainable development the stronger helps the weaker This aid may take various forms 'The Stronger' offers real help rather than striving for the elimination or annihilation of the other Sustainable development reduces poverty through financial among other things a balanced budget environmental living conditions and social including equality of income means   Architecture edit   Sustainable architecture In sustainable architecture the recent movements of New Urbanism and New Classical architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth architectural tradition and classical design     This in contrast to modernist and International Style architecture as well as opposing to solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl with long commuting distances and large ecological footprints   Both trends started in the 1980s It should be noted that sustainable architecture is predominantly relevant to the economics domain while architectural landscaping pertains more to the ecological domain citation needed Politics edit   Environmental politics Environmental governance and Sustainability metrics and indices A study concluded that social indicators and therefore sustainable development indicators are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policy-making   The International Institute for Sustainable Development has similarly developed a political policy framework linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics The framework consists of six core areas international trade and investment economic policy climate change and energy measurement and assessment natural resource management and the role of communication technologies in sustainable development The United Nations Global Compact Cities Programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance The political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation authorisation legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic ecological and cultural challenges It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed They have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics   Organization and governance Law and justice Communication and critique Representation and negotiation Security and accord Dialogue and reconciliation Ethics and accountability This accords with the Brundtland Commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles see above Culture edit Framing of sustainable development progress according to the Circles of Sustainability used by the United Nations Working with a different emphasis some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development since the triple-bottom-line dimensions of economic environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society In this context the Agenda   for culture and the United Cities and Local Governments UCLG Executive Bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement \"Culture Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development\" passed on   November   in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders 3rd World Congress of UCLG held in Mexico City This document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach developing a solid cultural policy and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies The Circles of Sustainability approach distinguishes the four domains of economic ecological political and cultural sustainability       Other organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development The Network of Excellence \"Sustainable Development in a Diverse World\"   sponsored by the European Union integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets cultural diversity as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development The Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development Theory has been referenced by executive director of IMI Institute at UNESCO Vito Di Bari   in his manifesto of art and architectural movement Neo-Futurism whose name was inspired by the   United Nations report Our Common Future The Circles of Sustainability approach used by Metropolis defines the fourth cultural domain as practices discourses and material expressions which over time express continuities and discontinuities of social

was the third international conference on sustainable development which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community An outcome of this conference was the development of the Sustainable Development Goals that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world However few nations met the World Wide Fund for Nature 's definition of sustainable development criteria established in     Although some nations are more developed than others all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms   Measurement edit Main articles Ecological footprint and Sustainability measurement Deforestation and increased road-building in the Amazon Rainforest are a concern because of increased human encroachment upon wilderness areas increased resource extraction and further threats to biodiversity In   a report for the U S Environmental Protection Agency stated \"While much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable At best they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction or that our current activities are not sustainable More often they simply draw our attention to the existence of problems doing little to tell us the origin of those problems and nothing to tell us how to solve them \"   Nevertheless a majority of authors assume that a set of well defined and harmonised indicators is the only way to make sustainability tangible Those indicators are expected to be identified and adjusted through empirical observations trial and error   The most common critiques are related to issues like data quality comparability objective function and the necessary resources   However a more general criticism is coming from the project management community How can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we cannot monitor it in any single project?     The Cuban-born researcher and entrepreneur Sonia Bueno suggests an alternative approach that is based upon the integral long-term cost-benefit relationship as a measure and monitoring tool for the sustainability of every project activity or enterprise     Furthermore this concept aims to be a practical guideline towards sustainable development following the principle of conservation and increment of value rather than restricting the consumption of resources citation needed Reasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen U S Green Building Council's USGBC Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED This design incorporates some ecological economic and social elements The goals presented by LEED design goals are sustainable sites water efficiency energy and atmospheric emission reduction material and resources efficiency and indoor environmental quality Although amount of structures for sustainability development is many these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building citation needed Recent research efforts created also the SDEWES Index to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy water and environment systems The SDEWES Index consists of   dimensions   indicators and close to   sub-indicators It is currently applied to   cities   Natural capital edit Deforestation of native rain forest in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of clay for civil engineering   picture The sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital economic social and natural which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible   Leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly   for example points to the fact that natural capital can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services such as the protection provided by the ozone layer or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest In fact natural capital social capital and economic capital are often complementarities A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources Forests for example not only provide the raw material for paper which can be substituted quite easily but they also maintain biodiversity regulate water flow and absorb CO2 citation needed Another problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility The loss of biodiversity for example is often definitive The same can be true for cultural diversity For example with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates Moreover the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached A lake can for example absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity However once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly citation needed Business-as-usual edit Before flue-gas desulfurization was installed the air-polluting emissions from this power plant in New Mexico contained excessive amounts of sulfur dioxide If the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it Cohen and Winn   point to four types of market failure as possible explanations First while the benefits of natural or social capital depletion can usually be privatised the costs are often externalised i e they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general Second natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital Information asymmetry is a third reason often the link between cause and effect is obscured making it difficult for actors to make informed choices Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a \"business as usual\" mentality citation needed Education edit Main page Education for sustainable development Education must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive to continue to learn to solve problems to be creative and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives a quiet revolution is set in motion education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world     Higher education in sustainability across education streams including engineering finance supply chain and operations is gaining weight-age Multiple institutes including Wharton Columbia CASI Global New York offer certifications in Sustainability Corporate's prefer employees certified in sustainability Reference Insubstantial stretching of the term edit It has been argued that since the 1960s the concept of sustainable development has changed from \"conservation management\" to \"economic development\" whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat       In the 1960s the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil climate and water availability This was a strategy of conservation management In the 1970s however the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries and not just in Africa This was a strategy of economic development and the strategy was carried even further by the Brundtland Commission 's report on Our Common Future when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application       In effect the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers But shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of sustainable yield from the use of renewable resources only like forestry to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources like minerals     This stretching of the term has been questioned Thus environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally there can be no such thing as overall \"sustainable development\" in an industrialised world economy that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources \"It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource even with substantial recycling effort and use rates Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock \"     In effect it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable   20f   22f         One critic has argued that the Brundtland Commission promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of \"sustainable development\" attached as a public relations slogan       The report on Our Common Future was largely the result of a political bargaining process involving many special interest groups all put together to create a common appeal of political acceptability across borders After World War II the notion of \"development\" had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world In the 1970s and 1980s this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights basic human needs and finally ecological issues The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations as usual This issue demanded more economic growth also in the rich countries who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out as usual When the discussion switched to global ecological limits to growth the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency or what was termed \"a change in the quality of growth\" However most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early-20th century already and as usual only this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report Taken together the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact Since the publication of the report the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of \"sustainable development\" has marched on worldwide         edit Agroecology Applied

cradle   cradle or regenerative design is a biomimetic approach to the design of products and systems that models human industry on nature's processes viewing materials as nutrients circulating in healthy safe metabolisms The term itself is a play on the popular corporate phrase \"Cradle to Grave \" implying that the C2C model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations i e from the birth or \"cradle \" of one generation to the next versus from birth to death or \"grave \" within the same generation C2C suggests that industry must protect and enrich ecosystems and nature's biological metabolism while also maintaining a safe productive technical metabolism for the high-quality use and circulation of organic and technical nutrients   It is a holistic economic industrial and social framework that seeks to create systems that are not only efficient but also essentially waste free   The model in its broadest sense is not limited to industrial design and manufacturing it can be applied to many aspects of human civilization such as urban environments buildings economics and social systems The term Cradle to Cradle is a registered trademark of McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry MBDC consultants Cradle to Cradle product certification began as a proprietary system however in   MBDC turned the certification over to an independent non-profit called the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute Independence openness and transparency are the Institute's first objectives for the certification protocols   The phrase \"cradle to cradle\" itself was coined by Walter R Stahel in the 1970s The current model is based on a system of \"lifecycle development\" initiated by Michael Braungart and colleagues at the Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency EPEA in the 1990s and explored through the publication A Technical Framework for Life-Cycle Assessment In   Braungart and William McDonough published a book called Cradle to Cradle Remaking the Way We Make Things a manifesto for cradle to cradle design that gives specific details of how to achieve the model The model has been implemented by a number of companies organizations and governments

Introduction edit In the cradle to cradle model all materials used in industrial or commercial processes such as metals fibers dyes fall into one of two categories \"technical\" or \"biological\" nutrients Technical nutrients are strictly limited to non-toxic non-harmful synthetic materials that have no negative effects on the natural environment they can be used in continuous cycles as the same product without losing their integrity or quality In this manner these materials can be used over and over again instead of being \" downcycled \" into lesser products ultimately becoming waste Biological Nutrients are organic materials that once used can be disposed of in any natural environment and decompose into the soil providing food for small life forms without affecting the natural environment This is dependent on the ecology of the region for example organic material from one country or landmass may be harmful to the ecology of another country or landmass   Biological and Technical Cycles Biological and technical cycle The two types of materials each follow their own cycle in the regenerative economy envisioned by Keunen and Huizing Structure edit Initially defined by McDonough and Braungart the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute's five certification criteria are   Material health which involves identifying the chemical composition of the materials that make up the product Particularly hazardous materials e g heavy metals pigments halogen compounds etc have to be reported whatever the concentration and other materials reported where they exceed   ppm For wood the forest source is required The risk for each material is assessed against criteria and eventually ranked on a scale with green being materials of low risk yellow being those with moderate risk but are acceptable to continue to use and red for materials that have high risk and need to be phased out Grey for materials with incomplete data The method uses the term 'risk' in the sense of hazard as opposed to consequence and likelihood Material reutilization which is about recovery and recycling at the end of product life Assessment of energy required for production which for the highest level of certification needs to be based on at least 50% renewable energy for all parts and subassemblies Water particularly usage and discharge quality Social responsibility which assesses fair labor practices The certification is available at several levels basic silver gold platinum with more stringent requirements at each Prior to   MBDC controlled the certification protocol Health

exposed C2C seeks to remove dangerous technical nutrients synthetic materials such as mutagenic materials heavy metals and other dangerous chemicals from current life cycles If the materials we come into contact with and are exposed to on a daily basis are not toxic and do not have long term health effects then the health of the overall system can be better maintained For example a fabric factory can eliminate all harmful technical nutrients by carefully reconsidering what chemicals they use in their dyes to achieve the colours they need and attempt to do so with fewer base chemicals   Economics edit The use of a C2C model often lowers the financial cost of systems For example in the redesign of the Ford River Rouge Complex the planting of Sedum stonecrop vegetation on assembly plant roofs retains and cleanses rain water It also moderates the internal temperature of the building in order to save energy The roof is part of an $18 million rainwater treatment system designed to clean   billion US gallons       m   of rainwater annually This saved Ford $50 million that would otherwise have been spent on mechanical treatment facilities   If products are designed according to C2C design principles they can be manufactured and sold for less than alternative designs They eliminate the need for waste disposal such as landfills citation needed Definitions edit Cradle to Cradle a play on the phrase \"Cradle to Grave\" implying that the C2C model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations Technical nutrients are basically inorganic or synthetic materials manufactured by humans such as plastics and metals that can be used many times over without any loss in quality staying in a continuous cycle Biological nutrients and materials are organic materials that can decompose into the natural environment soil water etc without affecting it in a negative way providing food for bacteria and microbiological life Materials are usually referred to as the building blocks of other materials such as the dyes used in colouring fibers or rubbers used in the sole of a shoe Downcycling is the reuse of materials into lesser products For example a plastic computer case could be downcycled into a plastic cup which then becomes a park bench etc this may eventually lead to waste In conventional understanding this is no different from recycling that produces a supply of the same product or material Waste = Food is a basic concept of organic waste materials becoming food for bugs insects and other small forms of life who can feed on it decompose it and return it to the natural environment which we then indirectly use for food ourselves Existing synthetic materials edit The question of how to deal with the countless existing technical nutrients synthetic materials that cannot be recycled or reintroduced to the natural environment is dealt with in C2C design The materials that can be reused and retain their quality can be used within the technical nutrient cycles while other materials are far more difficult to deal with such as plastics in the Pacific Ocean Hypothetical examples edit One effective example is a shoe that is designed and mass-produced using the C2C model The sole might be made of \"biological nutrients\" while the upper parts might be made of \"technical nutrients\" The shoe is mass-produced at a manufacturing plant that utilises its waste material by putting it back into the cycle an example of this is using off-cuts from the rubber soles to make more soles instead of merely disposing of them this is dependent on the technical materials not losing their quality as they are reused Once the shoes have been manufactured they are distributed to retail outlets where the customer buys the shoe at a fraction of the price they would normally pay for a shoe of comparable aspects the customer is only paying for the use of the materials in the shoe for the period of time that they will be using the shoe When they outgrow the shoe or it is damaged they return it to the manufacturer When the manufacturer separates the sole from the upper parts separating the technical and biological nutrients the biological nutrients are returned to the natural environment while the technical nutrients are used to create the sole of another shoe Another example of C2C design is a disposable cup bottle or wrapper made entirely out of biological materials When the user is finished with the item it can be disposed of and returned to the natural environment the cost of disposal of waste such as landfill and recycling is eliminated The user could also potentially return the item for a refund so it can be used again Ford Model U is a design concept of a car made completely from cradle-to-cradle materials It also uses hydrogen propulsion Finished products edit Cradle-to-cradle shoes have been made through the Nike Considered project   The Edag light car Rohner Textile AG Climatex -textile   Biofoam a cradle-to-cradle alternative to expanded polystyrene   Sewage sludge processing plants are facilities that create fertiliser from sewage sludge This approach is green retrofit for the current inefficient system of organic waste disposal as composting toilets are a better approach in the long run citation needed Aquion Energy large scale batterys Ecovative Design packaging and insulation made from waste by binding it together with Mycelium Implementation edit The C2C model can be applied to almost any system in modern society urban environments buildings manufacturing social systems   steps are outlined in Cradle to Cradle Remaking the way we make things   Get \"free of\" known culprits Follow informed personal preferences Create \"passive positive\" lists lists of materials used categorised according to their safety level The X List substances that must be phased out such as teratogenic mutagenic carcinogenic The Gray List problematic substances that are not so urgently in need of phasing out The P List the \"positive\" list substances actively defined as safe for use Activate the positive list Reinvent the redesign of the former system Products that adhere to all steps can generally be granted a certification Two certifications used for cradle-to-cradle products include Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED and BRE Environmental Assessment Method BREEAM   C2C principles were first applied to systems in the early 1990s by Braungart's Hamburger Umweltinstitut HUI and The Environmental Institute in Brazil for biomass nutrient recycling of effluent to produce agricultural products and clean water as a byproduct In   William McDonough helped found the Center for Eco-Intelligent Management at Instituto de Empresa Business School The center's research produced the Biosphere Rules a set of five implementation principles that facilitate the adoption of closed loop production approaches with a minimum of disruption for established companies In   MBDC and the EPEA formed a strategic partnership with global materials consultancy Material ConneXion to help promote and disseminate C2C design principles by providing greater global access to C2C material information certification and product development   As of January   Material ConneXion's Materials Libraries in New York Milan Cologne Bangkok and Daegu Korea started to feature C2C assessed and certified materials and in collaboration with MBDC and EPEA the company now offers C2C Certification and C2C product development   While the C2C model has influenced the construction or redevelopment of many smaller buildings several large companies organisations and governments have also implemented the C2C model and its ideas and concepts Major implementations edit The Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies incorporates cradle to cradle systems throughout the center The use of the term C2C is replaced with Regenerative The Chinese Government is constructing many cities like Huangbaiyu based on C2C principles utilising the rooftops for agriculture   The Ford River Rouge Complex redevelopment   Cleaning   billion US gallons       m   of rainwater annually The Netherlands Institute of Ecology NIOO-KNAW will make its laboratory and office complex completely cradle to cradle compliant   Several private houses and communal buildings in the Netherlands     Fashion Positive an initiative to assist the fashion world in implementing the cradle-to-cradle model in five areas material health material reuse renewable energy water stewardship and social fairness     Coordination with other models edit The Cradle to Cradle model can be viewed as a framework that considers systems as a whole or holistically It can be applied to many aspects of human society and is related to Life cycle assessment See for instance the LCA based model of the Eco-costs which has been designed to cope with analyses of recycle systems   The Cradle to Cradle model in some implementations is closely linked with the Car-free movement such as in the case of large-scale building projects or the construction or redevelopment of urban environments It is closely linked with passive solar design in the building industry and with permaculture in agriculture within or near urban environments An earthship is a perfect example where different re-use models are used cradle to cradle and permaculture In   IE Business School in Madrid launched the Center for Eco-Intelligent Innovation in collaboration with William McDonough to study the implementation of Cradle to Cradle design approaches in pioneering businesses The academic research of companies lead to the elaboration of the Biosphere Rules a set of five principles derived from nature that guide the implementation of circular models in production Constraints edit A major constraint in the optimal recycling of materials is that at civic amenity sites products are not disassembled by hand and have each individual part sorted into a bin but instead have the entire product sorted into a certain bin This makes the extraction of rare earth elements and other materials uneconomical at recycling sites products typically get crushed after which the materials are extracted by means of magnets chemicals special sorting methods and thus optimal recycling of for example metals is impossible an optimal recycling method for metals would require to sort all similar alloys together rather than mixing plain iron with alloys Obviously disassembling products is not feasible at currently designed civic amenity sites and a better method would be to send back the broken products to the manufacturer so that the manufacturer can disassemble the product These disassembled product can then be used for making new products or at least to have the components sent separately to recycling sites for proper recycling by the exact type of material At present though few laws are put in place in any country to oblige manufacturers to take back their products for disassembly nor are there even such obligations for manufacturers of cradle-to-cradle products One process where this is happening is in the EU with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive Criticism and response edit Criticism has been advanced     on the fact that McDonough and Braungart previously kept C2C consultancy and certification in their inner circle Critics argued that this lack of competition prevented the model from fulfilling its potential Many critics pleaded for a public-private partnership overseeing the C2C concept thus enabling competition and growth of practical applications and services McDonough and Braungart responded to this criticism by giving control of the certification protocol to a non-profit independent Institute called the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute McDonough said the new institute \"will enable our protocol to become a public certification program and global standard \"   The new Institute announced the creation of a Certification Standards Board in June   The new board under the auspices of the Institute will oversee the certification moving forward   Experts in the field of environment protection have questioned the practicability of the concept Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek head of the German Wuppertal Institute called his assertion that the \"old\" environmental movement had hindered innovation with its pessimist approach \"pseudo-psychological humbug\" I can feel very nice on Michael's seat covers   in the airplane Nevertheless I am still waiting for a detailed proposal for a design of the other     percent of the Airbus   after his principles In   Schmidt-Bleek stated that it is out of the question that the concept can be realized on a bigger scale   Some claim that C2C certification may not be entirely sufficient in all eco-design approaches Quantitative methodologies LCAs and more adapted tools regarding the product type which is considered could be used in tandem The C2C concept ignores the use phase of a product According to the Variants of Life Cycle Assessment the entire life cycle of a product or service has to be evaluated not only the material itself For many goods e g in transport the use phase has the most influence on the environmental footprint E g the more lightweight a car or a plane the less fuel it consumes and consequently the less impact it has Braungart fully ignores the use phase     It is safe to say that every production step or resource-transformation step needs a certain amount of energy The C2C concept foresees an own certification of its analysis   and therefore is in contradiction to international ISO standards   and   for Life Cycle Assessment whereas an independent and critical review is needed in order to obtain comparative and resilient results Independent external review     edit Appropriate technology Circular economy Downcycling Ecodesign Huangbaiyu Life cycle

technology     navigation search Appropriate technology is a movement and its manifestations encompassing technological choice and application that is small-scale decentralized labor-intensive energy-efficient environmentally sound and locally autonomous   It was originally articulated as intermediate technology by the economist Dr Ernst Friedrich \"Fritz\" Schumacher in his work Small is Beautiful Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasize the technology as people-centered   Appropriate technology has been used to address issues in a wide range of fields Well-known examples of appropriate technology applications include bike- and hand-powered water pumps and other self-powered equipment the universal nut sheller self-contained solar lamps and streetlights and passive solar building designs Today appropriate technology is often developed using open source principles which have led to open-source appropriate technology OSAT and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the Internet     OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for sustainable development     Appropriate technology is most commonly discussed in its relationship to economic development and as an alternative to technology transfer of more capital -intensive technology from industrialized nations to developing countries     However appropriate technology movements can be found in both developing and developed countries In developed countries the appropriate technology movement grew out of the energy crisis of the 1970s and focuses mainly on environmental and sustainability issues   Today the idea is multifaceted in some contexts appropriate technology can be described as the simplest level of technology that can achieve the intended purpose whereas in others it can refer to engineering that takes adequate consideration of social and environmental ramifications The facets are connected through

 References   Further reading     Background edit History edit History of technology the development over time of systematic techniques for making and doing things The term technology a combination of the Greek techn \"art craft\" with logos \"word speech\" meant in Greece a discourse on the arts both fine and applied When it first appeared in English in the 17th century it was used to mean a discussion of the applied arts only and gradually these \"arts\" themselves came to be the object of the designation By the early 20th century the term embraced a growing range of means processes and ideas in addition to tools and machines By mid-century technology was defined by such phrases as \"the means or activity by which man seeks to change or manipulate his environment \" Even such broad definitions have been criticized by observers who point out the increasing difficulty of distinguishing between scientific inquiry and technological activity A highly compressed account of the history of technology such as this one must adopt a rigorous methodological pattern if it is to do justice to the subject without grossly distorting it one way or another The plan followed in the present article is primarily chronological tracing the development of technology through phases that succeed each other in time Obviously the division between phases is to a large extent arbitrary One factor in the weighting has been the enormous acceleration of Western technological development in recent centuries Eastern technology is considered in this article in the main only as it relates to the development of modern technology Predecessors edit Indian ideological leader Mahatma Gandhi is often cited as the \"father\" of the appropriate technology movement Though the concept had not been given a name Gandhi advocated for small local and predominantly village-based technology to help India's villages become self-reliant He disagreed with the idea of technology that benefited a minority of people at the expense of the majority or that put people out of work to increase profit   In   Gandhi founded the All-India Spinners Association and in   he retired from politics to form the All-India Village Industries Association Both organizations focused on village-based technology similar to the future appropriate technology movement   China also implemented policies similar to appropriate technology during the reign of Mao Zedong and the following Cultural Revolution During the Cultural Revolution development policies based on the idea of \"walking on two legs\" advocated the development of both large-scale factories and small-scale village industries   E F Schumacher edit Despite these early examples Dr Ernst Friedrich \"Fritz\" Schumacher is credited as the founder of the appropriate technology movement A well-known economist Schumacher worked for the British National Coal Board for more than   years where he blamed the size of the industry's operations for its uncaring response to the harm black-lung disease inflicted on the miners   However it was his work with developing countries such as India and Burma which helped Schumacher form the underlying principles of appropriate technology Schumacher first articulated the idea of \"intermediate technology \" now known as appropriate technology in a   report to the Indian Planning Commission in which he described India as long in labor and short in capital calling for an \"intermediate industrial technology\"   that harnessed India's labor surplus Schumacher had been developing the idea of intermediate technology for several years prior to the Planning Commission report In   following a stint as an economic advisor to the government of Burma he published the short paper \"Economics in a Buddhist Country \" his first known critique of the effects of Western economics on developing countries   In addition to Buddhism Schumacher also credited his ideas to Gandhi Initially Schumacher's ideas were rejected by both the Indian government and leading development economists Spurred to action over concern the idea of intermediate technology would languish Schumacher George McRobie Mansur Hoda   and Julia Porter brought together a group of approximately   people to form the Intermediate Technology Development Group ITDG in May   Later that year a Schumacher article published in the Observer garnered significant attention and support for the group In   the group published the Tools for Progress A Guide to Small-scale Equipment for Rural Development and sold     copies ITDG also formed panels of experts and practitioners around specific technological needs such as building construction energy and water to develop intermediate technologies to address those needs   At a conference hosted by the ITDG in   the term \"intermediate technology\" was discarded in favor of the term \"appropriate technology\" used today Intermediate technology had been criticized as suggesting the technology was inferior to advanced or high technology and not including the social and political factors included in the concept put forth by the proponents   In   Schumacher described the concept of appropriate technology to a mass audience in his influential work Small is Beautiful Economics as if People Mattered Growing trend edit The Universal Nut Sheller in use in Uganda an example of appropriate technology Between   and   the number of new appropriate technology organizations founded each year was three times greater than the previous nine years There was also an increase in organizations focusing on applying appropriate technology to the problems of industrialized nations particularly issues related to energy and the environment   In   the OECD identified in its Appropriate Technology Directory   organizations involved in the development and promotion of appropriate technology By   this number had grown to more than     International agencies and government departments were also emerging as major innovators in appropriate technology indicating its progression from a small movement fighting against the established norms to a legitimate technological choice supported by the establishment For example the Inter-American Development Bank created a Committee for the Application of Intermediate Technology in   and the World Health Organization established the Appropriate Technology for Health Program in     Appropriate technology was also increasingly applied in developed countries For example the energy crisis of the mid-1970s led to the creation of the National Center for Appropriate Technology NCAT in   with an initial appropriation of   million dollars from the U S Congress The Center sponsored appropriate technology demonstrations to \"help low-income communities find better ways to do things that will improve the quality of life and that will be doable with the skills and resources at hand \" However by   the NCAT's funding agency Community Services Administration had been abolished For several decades NCAT worked with the US departments of Energy and Agriculture on contract to develop appropriate technology programs Since   NCAT's informational web site is no longer funded by the US government   Decline edit In more recent years the appropriate technology movement has continued to decline in prominence Germany's German Appropriate Technology Exchange GATE and Holland's Technology Transfer for Development TOOL are examples of organizations no longer in operation Recently a study looked at the continued barriers to AT deployment despite the relatively low cost of transferring information in the internet age The barriers have been identified as AT seen as inferior or \"poor person's\" technology technical transferability and robustness of AT insufficient funding weak institutional support and the challenges of distance and time in tackling rural poverty   A more free market -centric view has also begun to dominate the field For example Paul Polak founder of International Development Enterprises an organization that designs and manufactures products that follow the ideals of appropriate technology declared appropriate technology dead in a   blog post   Polak argues the \" design for the other   percent \" movement has replaced appropriate technology Growing out of the appropriate technology movement designing for the other   percent advocates the creation of low-cost solutions for the     billion of the world's     billion population \"who have little or no access to most of the products and services many of us take for granted \"   Many of the ideas integral to appropriate technology can now be found in the increasingly popular \" sustainable development \" movement which among many tenets advocates technological choice that meets human needs while preserving the environment for future generations   In   the OECD published the results of an extensive survey of appropriate technology organizations titled The World of Appropriate Technology in which it defined appropriate technology as characterized by \"low investment cost per work-place low capital investment per unit of output organizational simplicity high adaptability to a particular social or cultural environment sparing use of natural resources low cost of final product or high potential for employment \"   Today the OECD web site redirects from the \"Glossary of Statistical Terms\" entry on \"appropriate technology\" to \"environmentally sound technologies \"   The United Nations' \"Index to Economic and Social Development\" also redirects from the \"appropriate technology\" entry to \"sustainable development \"   Potential resurgence edit Despite the decline several appropriate technology organizations are still in existence including the ITDG which became Practical Action after a name change in     Skat Schwierzerische Kontaktstelle f r Angepasste Technology adapted by becoming a private consultancy in   though some Intermediate Technology activities are continued by Skat Foundation through the Rural Water Supply Network RWSN Another actor still very active is the charity CEAS Centre Ecologique Albert Schweitzer Pioneer in food transformation and solar heaters it offers vocational training in West Africa and Madagascar There is also currently a notable resurgence as viewed by the number of groups adopting open source appropriate technology OSAT because of the enabling technology of the Internet These OSAT groups include Akvo Foundation Appropedia Appropriate Technology Collaborative Catalytic Communities Centre for Alternative Technology Center For Development Alternatives Engineers Without Borders Open Source Ecology Practical Action and Village Earth Most recently ASME Engineers Without Borders USA and the IEEE have joined together to produce Engineering for Change which facilitates the development of affordable locally appropriate and sustainable solutions to the most pressing humanitarian challenges Terminology edit Appropriate technology frequently serves as an umbrella term for a variety names for this type of technology Frequently these terms are used interchangeably however the use of one term over another can indicate the specific focus bias or agenda of the technological choice in question Though the original name for the concept now known as appropriate technology \"intermediate technology\" is now often considered a subset of appropriate technology that focuses on technology that is more productive than \"inefficient\" traditional technologies but less costly than the technology of industrialized societies   Other types of technology under the appropriate technology umbrella include Capital-saving technology Labor-intensive technology Alternate technology Self-help technology Village-level technology Community technology Progressive technology Indigenous technology People s technology Light-engineering technology Adaptive technology Light-capital technology Soft technology A variety of competing definitions exist in academic literature and organization and government policy papers for each of these terms       However the general consensus is appropriate technology encompasses the ideas represented by the above list Furthermore the use of one term over another in referring to an appropriate technology can indicate ideological bias or emphasis on particular economic or social variables Some terms inherently emphasize the importance of increased employment and labor utilization such as labor-intensive or capital-saving technology while others may emphasize the importance of human development such as self-help and people's technology   It is also possible to distinguish between hard and soft technologies According to Dr Maurice Albertson and Audrey Faulkner appropriate hard technology is \"engineering techniques physical structures and machinery that meet a need defined by a community and utilize the material at hand or readily available It can be built operated and maintained by the local people with very limited outside assistance e g technical material or financial it is usually related to an economic goal \"   Albertson and Faulkner consider appropriate soft technology as technology that deals with \"the social structures human interactive processes and motivation techniques It is the structure and process for social participation and action by individuals and groups in analyzing situations making choices and engaging in choice-implementing behaviors that bring about change \"   Practitioners edit Some of the well known practitioners of the appropriate technology-sector include B V Doshi   Buckminster Fuller William Moyer     Amory Lovins Sanoussi Diakit Albert Bates Victor Papanek Giorgio Ceragioli     Frithjof Bergmann Arne N ss     John Barrie and Mansur Hoda   Laurie Baker Development edit Schumacher's initial concept of intermediate technology was created as a critique of the currently prevailing development strategies which focused on maximizing aggregate economic growth through increases to overall measurements of a country's economy such as gross domestic product GDP   Developed countries became aware of the situation of developing countries during and in the years following World War II Based on the continuing rise in income levels in Western countries since the Industrial Revolution developed countries embarked on a campaign of massive transfers of capital and technology to developing countries in order to force a rapid industrialization intended to result in an economic \"take-off\" in the developing countries     However by the late 1960s it was becoming clear this development method had not worked as expected and a growing number of development experts and national policy makers were recognizing it as a potential cause of increasing poverty and income inequality in developing countries   In many countries this influx of technology had increased the overall economic capacity of the country However it had created a dual or two-tiered economy with pronounced division between the classes The foreign technology imports were only benefiting a small minority of urban elites This was also increasing urbanization with the rural poor moving to urban cities in hope of more financial opportunities The increased strain on urban infrastructures and public services led to \"increasing squalor severe impacts on public health and distortions in the social structure \"   Appropriate technology was meant to address four problems extreme poverty starvation unemployment and urban migration Schumacher saw the main purpose for economic development programs was the eradication of extreme poverty and he saw a clear connection between mass unemployment and extreme poverty Schumacher sought to shift development efforts from a bias towards urban areas and on increasing the output per laborer to focusing on rural areas where a majority of the population still lived and on increasing employment   In developed countries edit The term appropriate technology is also used in developed nations to describe the use of technology and engineering that result in less negative impacts on the environment and society i e technology should be both environmentally sustainable and socially appropriate     E F Schumacher asserts that such technology described in the book Small is Beautiful   tends to promote values such as health beauty and permanence in that order Often the type of appropriate technology that is used in developed countries is \"appropriate and sustainable technology\" AST   appropriate technology that besides being functional and relatively cheap though often more expensive than true AT is durable and employs renewable resources AT does not include this see Sustainable design Applications edit Building and construction edit In order to increase the efficiency of a great number of city services efficient water provisioning efficient electricity provisioning easy traffic flow water drainage decreased spread of disease with epidemics the city itself must first be built correctly In the developing world many cities are expanding rapidly and new ones are being built Looking into the cities design in advance is a must for every developing nation Further information Earth structure Autonomous building and Earthship Adobe including the variation called Super Adobe Rammed earth Compressed earth block Animal products Cob and/or other green building materials could be considered appropriate earth building technology for much of the developing world as they make use of materials which are widely available locally and are thus relatively inexpensive The local context must be considered as for example mudbrick may not be durable in a high rainfall area although a large roof overhang and cement stabilisation can be used to correct for this and if the materials are not readily available the method may be inappropriate Other forms of natural building may be considered appropriate technology though in many cases the emphasis is on sustainability and self-sufficiency rather than affordability or suitability As such many buildings are also built to function as autonomous buildings e g earthships One example of an organisation that applies appropriate earthbuilding techniques would be Builders Without Borders The building structure must also be considered Cost-effectiveness is an important issue in projects based around appropriate technology and one of the most efficient designs herein is the public housing approach This approach lets everyone have their own sleeping/recreation space yet incorporate communal spaces e g mess halls latrines public showers In addition to decrease costs of operation heating cooling techniques as Earth sheltering Trombe walls are often incorporated Organizations as Architecture for Humanity also follows principles consistent with appropriate technology aiming to serve the needs of poor and disaster-affected people Chunche naturally ventilated sheds for drying raisins in Xinjiang Natural ventilation can be created by providing vents in the upper level of a building to allow warm air to rise by convection and escape to the outside while cooler air is drawn in through vents at the lower level Electrical powered fans e g ceiling fans allow efficient cooling at a far lower electricity consumption as airconditioning systems A solar chimney often referred to as thermal chimney improves this natural ventilation by using convection of air heated by passive solar energy To further maximize the cooling effect the incoming air may be led through underground ducts before it is allowed to enter the building A windcatcher Badgir is a traditional Persian architectural device used for many centuries to create natural ventilation in buildings It is not known who first invented the windcatcher but it still can be seen in many countries today Windcatchers come in various designs such as the uni-directional bi-directional and multi-directional A passive down-draft cooltower may be used in a hot arid climate to provide a sustainable way to provide air conditioning Water is allowed to evaporate at the top of a tower either by using evaporative cooling pads or by spraying water Evaporation cools the incoming air causing a downdraft of cool air that will bring down the temperature inside the building Agriculture edit Appropriate technology has been applied extensively to improve agricultural production in developing countries In the United States the National Center for Appropriate Technology operates ATTRA attra ncat org a national sustainable agriculture assistance program Water and sanitation edit Water edit Further information drinking water Hand-operated reciprocating positive displacement water pump in Ko ice - Tahanovce Slovakia walking beam pump As of   waterborne diseases are estimated to cause     million deaths each year while about     billion people lack proper drinking water   Water generally needs treatment before use depending on the source and the intended use with high standards required for drinking water The quality of water from household connections and community water points in low-income countries is not reliably safe for direct human consumption Water extracted directly from surface waters and open hand-dug shallow wells nearly always requires treatment Appropriate technology options in water treatment include both community-scale and household-scale point-of-use POU designs The most reliable way to kill microbial pathogenic agents is to heat water to a rolling boil   Other techniques such as varying forms of filtration chemical disinfection and exposure to ultraviolet radiation including solar UV have been demonstrated in an array of randomized control trials to significantly reduce levels of waterborne disease among users in low-income countries Over the past decade an increasing number of field-based studies have been undertaken to determine the success of POU measures in reducing waterborne disease The ability of POU options to reduce disease is a function of both their ability to remove microbial pathogens if properly applied and such social factors as ease of use and cultural appropriateness Technologies may generate more or less health benefit than their lab-based microbial removal performance would suggest The current priority of the proponents of POU treatment is to reach large numbers of low-income households on a sustainable basis Few POU measures have reached significant scale thus far but efforts to promote and commercially distribute these products to the world's poor have only been under way for a few years On the other hand small-scale water treatment is reaching increasing fractions of the population in low-income countries particularly in South and Southeast Asia in the form of water treatment kiosks also known as water refill stations or packaged water producers While quality control and quality assurance in such locations may be variable sophisticated technology such as multi-stage particle filtration UV irradiation ozonation and membrane filtration is applied with increasing frequency Such microenterprises are able to vend water at extremely low prices with increasing government regulation Initial assessments of vended water quality are encouraging Whether applied at the household or community level some examples of specific treatment processes include Porous ceramic filtration using either clay or diatomaceous earth and oriented as either cylinder pot or disk with gravity-fed or siphon-driven delivery systems Silver is frequently added to provide antimicrobial enhancement Intermittently operated slow-sand filtration also known as biosand filtration Chlorine disinfection employing calcium hypochlorite powder sodium hypochlorite solution or sodium dichloroisocyanurate NaDCC tablets Chemical flocculation using either commercially produced iron or aluminum salts or the crushed seeds of certain plants such as Moringa oleifera Recent work has shown even table salt NaCl is effective at removing high-activity clays for solar water disinfection   Irradiation with ultraviolet light whether using electric-powered lamps or direct solar exposure such as with the SODIS method Mixed flocculation/disinfection using commercially produced powdered mixtures membrane filtration employing ultrafiltration or reverse osmosis filter elements preceded by pretreatment Some appropriate technology water supply measures include Deep wells with submersible pumps in areas where the groundwater aquifers are located at depths >10 m Shallow wells with lined walls and covers Rainwater harvesting systems with an appropriate method of storage especially in areas with significant dry seasons Fog collection which is suitable for areas which experience fog even when there is little rain Air wells a structure or device designed to promote the condensation of atmospheric moisture Handpumps and treadle pumps are generally only an option in areas is located at a relatively shallow depth e g   m The Flexi-Pipe Pump is a notable exception to this up to   meter For deeper aquifers <10 m submersible pumps placed inside a well are used Treadle pumps for household irrigation are now being distributed on a widespread basis in developing countries The principle of Village Level Operation and Maintenance is important with handpumps but may be difficult in application Condensation bags and condensation pits can be an appropriate technology to get water yet yields are low and are for the amount of water obtained labour-intensive Still it may be a good very cheap solution for certain desperate communities The hippo water roller and Q-drum allow more water to be carried with less effort and could thus be a good alternative for ethnic communities who do not wish to give up water gathering from remote locations assuming low topographic relief The roundabout playpump developed and used in southern Africa harnesses the energy of children at play to pump water Sanitation edit   Sanitation Poor sanitation is a major issue for a large proportion of the human population with about     billion people lacking even the most basic forms of sanitation and more than a billion people worldwide practising open defecation in   according to the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation of the United Nations     The ideas of appropriate technology influenced the provision of sanitation systems for many years However since about the early 2000s there has been a departure from a focus on simplistic 'one-size-fits-all' sanitation systems     As conditions vary sanitation systems also need to vary to meet the needs of the users and other stakeholders   Technologies for sanitation provision such as toilets are important but only one piece of the puzzle Sanitation needs to be regarded as a system that includes technical and non-technical aspects such as behavior change and management as well as political aspects the enabling environment   The overall aim should be to achieve a sustainable sanitation system One option of achieving that aim can be the ecological sanitation approach which focuses on safe reuse of excreta It is impossible to name all possible sanitation technologies that may fall under the category of \"appropriate technologies\" but some common systems which might be considered to be \"appropriate\" include Dry toilets as they save on flushing water and may allow the nutrients of the excreta to be reused in agriculture e g for fertilising crops Two examples of dry toilets are composting toilets and urine-diverting dry toilets Constructed wetlands which can treat wastewater and greywater and require only little electrical power The SanPlat is a simple plate that can be used to cover the hole in the ground of pit latrines making them potentially more easy to clean and maintain     The Arborloo which is a very simple low-cost type of composting toilet suitable for rural areas Energy generation and uses edit Further information Microgeneration and Remote-area power supply The term soft energy technology was coined by Amory Lovins to describe \"appropriate\" renewable energy   \"Appropriate\" energy technologies are especially suitable for isolated and/or small scale energy needs Electricity can be provided from Photovoltaic PV solar panels and large Concentrating solar power plants PV solar panels made from low-cost photovoltaic cells or PV-cells which have first been concentrated by a Luminescent solar concentrator -panel are also a good option Especially companies as Solfocus make appropriate technology CSP plants which can be made from waste plastics polluting the surroundings see above Solar thermal collector wind power home do-it yourself turbines and larger-scale micro hydro and pico hydro   human-powered handwheel generators   other zero emission generation methods Some intermediate technologies include Bioalcohols as bioethanol biomethanol and biobutanol The first two require minor modifications to allow them to be used in conventional gasoline engines The third requires no modifications at all V egetable oils which can be used only in internal combustion Diesel engines Biofuels are locally available in many developing countries and can be cheaper than fossil fuels Anaerobic digestion power plants Biogas is another potential source of energy particularly where there is an abundant supply of waste organic matter A generator running on biofuels can be run more efficiently if combined with batteries and an inverter this adds significantly to capital cost but reduces running cost and can potentially make this a much cheaper option than the solar wind and micro-hydro options Dry animal dung fuel can also be used Biochar is another similar energy source which can be obtained through charring of certain types of organic material e g hazelnut shells bamboo chicken manure in a pyrolysis unit   A similar energy source is terra preta nova Finally urine can also be used as a basis to generate hydrogen which is an energy carrier Using urine hydrogen production is 332% more energy efficient than using water   Electricity distribution could be improved so to make use of a more structured electricity line arrangement and universal AC power plugs and sockets e g the CEE 7/7 plug In addition a universal system of electricity provisioning e g universal voltage frequency amp re e g   V with   Hz as well as perhaps a better mains power system e g through the use of special systems as perfected single-wire earth returns e g Tunisia's MALT-system which features low costs and easy placement     Electricity storage which is required for autonomous energy systems can be provided through appropriate technology solutions as deep-cycle and car- batteries intermediate technology long duration flywheels electrochemical capacitors compressed air energy storage CAES liquid nitrogen and pumped hydro   Many solutions for the developing world are sold as a single package containing a micro electricity generation power plant and energy storage Such packages are called remote-area power supply LED Lamp with GU10 twist lock fitting intended to replace halogen reflector lamps White LEDs and a source of renewable energy such as solar cells are used by the Light Up the World Foundation to provide lighting to poor people in remote areas and provide significant benefits compared to the kerosene lamps which they replace Certain other companies as Powerplus also have LED-flashlights with imbedded solar cells   Organic LEDs made by roll-to-roll production are another source of cheap light that will be commercially available at low cost by   Compact fluorescent lamps as well as regular fluorescent lamps and LED-lightbulbs can also be used as appropriate technology Although they are less environmentally friendly then LED-lights they are cheaper and still feature relative high efficiency compared to incandescent lamps The Safe bottle lamp is a safer kerosene lamp designed in Sri Lanka Lamps as these allow relative long mobile lighting The safety comes from a secure screw-on metal lid and two flat sides which prevent it from rolling if knocked over An alternative to fuel or oil-based lanterns is the Uday lantern developed by Philips as part of its Lighting Africa project sponsored by the World Bank Group   The Faraday flashlight is a LED flashlight which operates on a capacitor Recharging can be done by manual winching or by shaking hereby avoiding the need of any supplementary electrical system HID-lamps finally can be used for lighting operations where regular LED-lighting or other lamps will not suffice Examples are car headlights Due to their high efficiency they are quite environmental yet costly and they still require polluting materials in their production process Transportation edit A man uses a bicycle to cargo goods in Ouagadougou Burkina Faso   Human powered-vehicles include the bicycle and the future bamboo bicycle which provides general-purpose transportation at lower costs compared to motorized vehicles and many advantages over walking and the whirlwind wheelchair which provides mobility for disabled people who cannot afford the expensive wheelchairs used in developed countries Animal powered vehicles/transport may also be another appropriate technology Certain zero-emissions vehicles may be considered appropriate transportation technology including compressed air cars liquid nitrogen and hydrogen-powered vehicles Also vehicles with internal combustion engines may be converted to hydrogen or oxyhydrogen combustion Bicycles can also be applied to commercial transport of goods to and from remote areas An example of this is Karaba a free-trade coffee co-op in Rwanda which uses   modified bicycles to carry hundreds of pounds of coffee beans for processing   Other projects for developing countries include the redesign of cycle rickshaws to convert them to electric power     However recent reports suggest that these rickshaws are not plying on the roads   Health care edit According to the Global Health Council rather than the use of professionally schooled doctors the training of villagers to remedy most maladies in towns in the developing world is most appropriate   Trained villagers are able to eliminate 80% of the health problems Small low-cost hospitals based on the model of the Jamkhed hospital can remedy another 15% while only 5% will need to go to a larger more expensive hospital Before being able to determine the cause of the disease or malady accurate diagnosis is required This may be done manually through observation inquiries and by specialized tools A phase-change incubator developed in the late 1990s is a low cost way for health workers to incubate microbial samples Birth control is also seen as an appropriate technology especially now because of increasing population numbers overpopulating certain areas increasing food prices and poverty It has been proposed to a certain degree by PATH program for appropriate technology in health     Jaipur leg was developed by Dr P K Sethi and Masterji Ram Chander in   as an inexpensive prosthetic leg for victims of landmine explosions The Leveraged Freedom Chair is a low-cost wheelchair designed specifically for rough terrain   Natural cleaning products can be used for personal hygiene and cleaning of clothing and eating utensils in order to decrease illnesses/maladies as they eliminate a great amount of pathogens Note that many Appropriate Technologies benefit public health in particular by providing sanitation and safe drinking water Refrigeration may also provide a health benefit These are discussed in the following paragraphs This was too found at the Comprehensive Rural Health Project   and the Women Health Volunteers projects in countries as Iran Iraq and Nepal   Food preparation and storage edit Further information Grow house Some proven intensive low-effort food-production systems include urban gardening indoors and outdoors citation needed Indoor cultivation may be set up using hydroponics with Grow lights while outdoor cultivation may be done using permaculture forest gardening no-till farming Do Nothing Farming etc In order to better control the irrigation outdoors special irrigation systems may be created as well although this increases costs and may again open the door to cultivating non-indigenous plants something which is best avoided citation needed One such system for the developing world is discussed here   Crop production tools are best kept simple reduces operating difficulty cost replacement difficulties and pollution when compared to motorized equipment Tools can include scythes   animal-pulled plows   although no-till farming should be preferred   dibbers wheeled augers     for planting large trees kirpis hoes Greenhouses are also sometimes included see Earthship Biotincture citation needed Sometimes they are also fitted with irrigation systems and/or heat sink -systems which can respectively irrigate the plants or help to store energy from the sun and redistribute it at night when the greenhouse starts to cool down According to proponents Appropriate Technologies can greatly reduce the labor required to prepare food compared to traditional methods while being much simpler and cheaper than the processing used in Western countries This reflects E F Schumacher 's concept of \"intermediate technology \" i e technology which is significantly more effective and expensive than traditional methods but still an order of magnitude   times cheaper than developed world technology Key examples are the Malian peanut sheller the fonio husking machine the screenless hammer mill the ISF corn mill the ISF rice huller all other types of electrical or hand-operated kitchen equipment grinders cutters Special multifunctional kitchen robots that are able to perform several functions e g grinding cutting and even vacuum cleaning and polishing are able to reduce costs even more Examples of these devices were e g the now discontinued Piccolo household appliance from Hammelmann Werke previously based in Bad Kissingen It was equipped with a flexible axis allowing a variety of aids to be screwed on     In Ghana Zouzugu villagers use solar cookers for preparing their meals Solar cookers are appropriate to some settings depending on climate and cooking style They are emission-less and very low-cost Hybrid variants also exist that incorporate a second heating source such as electrical heating or wood-based Hot plates are 100% electrical fairly low cost around   and are mobile They do however require an electrical system to be present in the area of operation Rocket stoves and certain other woodstoves e g Philips Woodstove   improve fuel efficiency and reduce harmful indoor air pollution The stoves however still make use of wood However briquette makers can now turn organic waste into fuel saving money and/or collection time and preserving forests Solar special Einstein refrigerators and thermal mass refrigerators reduce the amount of electricity required Also solar and special Einstein refrigerators do not use haloalkanes which play a key role in ozone depletion but use heat pumps or mirrors instead Solar refrigerators have been built for developing nations by Sopology     The pot-in-pot refrigerator is an African invention which keeps things cool without electricity It provides a way to keep food and produce fresh for much longer than would otherwise be possible This can be a great benefit to the families who use the device For example it is claimed that girls who had to regularly sell fresh produce in the market can now go to school instead as there is less urgency to sell the produce before it loses freshness   Information and communication technologies edit   Information and communication technologies for development Netbooks such as the Asus Eee PC accommodate low-cost information sharing and communication The OLPC XO Simputer Asus Eee PC and other low cost computers are computers aimed at developing countries Besides the low price other characteristics include resistance to dust reliability and use of the target language Eldis OnDisc and The Appropriate Technology Library are projects that use CDs and DVDs to give access to development information in areas without reliable and affordable internet access The wind-up radio and the computer and communication system planned by the Jhai Foundation are independent from power supply There is also GrameenPhone which fused mobile telephony with Grameen Bank 's microfinance program to give Bangladeshi villagers access to communication Mobile telephony is appropriate technology for many developing countries as it greatly reduces the infrastructure required to achieve widespread coverage However mobile phone network may not always be available it depends on the location and may not always provide both voice and data services Loband a website developed by Aptivate strips all the photographic and other bandwidth-intensive content from webpages and renders them as simple text while otherwise allowing one to browse them normally The site greatly increasing the speed of browsing and is appropriate for use on low bandwidth connections as generally available in much of the developing world An increasing number of activists provide free or very inexpensive web and email services using cooperative computer networks that run wireless ad hoc networks Network service is provided by a cooperative of neighbors each operating a router as a household appliance These minimize wired infrastructure and its costs and vulnerabilities Private Internet protocol networks set up in this way can operate without the use of a commercial provider Rural electrical grids can be wired with \"optical phase cable\" in which one or more of the steel armor wires are replaced with steel tubes containing fiber optics   Satellite Internet access can provide high speed connectivity to remote locations however these are significantly more expensive than wire-based or terrestrial wireless systems Wimax and forms of packet radio can also be used Depending on the speed and latency of these networks they may be capable of relaying VoIP traffic negating the need for separate telephony services Finally the Internet Radio Linking Project provides potential for blending older cheap local radio broadcasting with the increased range of the internet satellite -based telephone systems can also be used as either fixed installations or portable handsets and can be integrated into a PABX or local IP-based network Finance edit Through financial systems envisioned especially for the poor/developed world many companies have been able to get started with only limited capital Often banks lend the money to people wishing to start a business such as with microfinance In other systems people for a Rotating Savings and Credit Association or ROSCA to purchase costly material together such as Tontines and Susu accounts Organisations communities cities or individuals can provide loans to other communities/cities such as with the approach followed by Kiva World Vision Microloans MicroPlace and LETS Finally in certain communities usually isolated communities such as small islands or oases everything of value is shared This is called gift economy Determining a sustainable approach edit Features such as low cost low usage of fossil fuels and use of locally available resources can give some advantages in terms of sustainability   For that reason these technologies are sometimes used and promoted by advocates of sustainability and alternative technology Besides using natural locally available resources   e g wood or adobe waste materials imported from cities using conventional and inefficient waste management may be gathered and re-used to build a sustainable living environment Use of these cities' waste material allows the gathering of a huge amount of building material at a low cost When obtained the materials may be recycled over and over in the own city/community using the cradle to cradle design method Locations where waste can be found include landfills junkyards on water surfaces and anywhere around towns or near highways Organic waste that can be reused to fertilise plants can be found in sewages Also town districts and other places e g cemeteries that are subject of undergoing renovation or removal can be used for

trade is a government market-based approach to controlling pollution by providing economic incentives for achieving reductions in the emissions of pollutants   In contrast to command-and-control environmental regulations such as best available technology BAT standards and government subsidies cap and trade CAT schemes are a type of flexible environmental regulation   that allows organizations to decide how best to meet policy targets Various countries states and groups of companies have adopted such trading systems notably for mitigating climate change   A central authority usually a governmental body allocates or sells a limited number of permits to discharge specific quantities of a specific pollutant per time period   Polluters are required to hold permits in amount equal to their emissions Polluters that want to increase their emissions must buy permits from others willing to sell them           Financial derivatives of permits can also be traded on secondary markets   In theory polluters who can reduce emissions most cheaply will do so achieving the emission reduction at the lowest cost to society   Cap and trade is meant to provide the private sector with the flexibility required to reduce emissions while stimulating technological innovation and economic growth   There are active trading programs in several air pollutants For greenhouse gases which cause climate change permit units are often called carbon credits The largest greenhouse gases trading program is the European Union Emission Trading Scheme   which trades primarily in European Union

trading coal may become a less competitive fuel than other options Pollution is the prime example of a market externality An externality is an effect of some activity on an entity such as a person that is not party to a market transaction related to that activity Emissions trading is a market-based approach to address pollution The overall goal of an emissions trading plan is to minimize the cost of meeting a set emissions target   In an emissions trading system the government sets an overall limit on emissions and defines permits also called allowances or limited authorizations to emit up to the level of the overall limit The government may sell the permits but in many existing schemes it gives permits to participants regulated polluters equal to each participant's baseline emissions The baseline is determined by reference to the participant's historical emissions To demonstrate compliance a participant must hold permits at least equal to the quantity of pollution it actually emitted during the time period If every participant complies the total pollution emitted will be at most equal to the sum of individual limits   Because permits can be bought and sold a participant can choose either to use its permits exactly by reducing its own emissions or to emit less than its permits and perhaps sell the excess permits or to emit more than its permits and buy permits from other participants In effect the buyer pays a charge for polluting while the seller gains a reward for having reduced emissions In many schemes organizations which do not pollute and therefore have no obligations may also trade permits and financial derivatives of permits In some schemes participants can bank allowances to use in future periods   In some schemes a proportion of all traded permits must be retired periodically causing a net reduction in emissions over time Thus environmental groups may buy and retire permits driving up the price of the remaining permits according to the law of demand   In most schemes permit owners can donate permits to a nonprofit entity and receive a tax deduction Usually the government lowers the overall limit over time with an aim towards a national emissions reduction target   According to the Environmental Defense Fund cap-and-trade is the most environmentally and economically sensible approach to controlling greenhouse gas emissions the primary cause of global warming because it sets a limit on emissions and the trading encourages companies to innovate in order to emit less   \"International trade can offer a range of positive and negative incentives to promote international cooperation on climate change robust evidence medium agreement Three issues are key to developing constructive relationships between international trade and climate agreements how existing trade policies and rules can be modified to be more climate friendly whether border adjustment measures BAMs or other trade measures can be effective in meeting the goals of international climate agreements whether the UNFCCC World Trade Organization WTO hybrid of the two or a new institution is the best forum for a trade-and-climate architecture \"   Market and least-cost edit Economy-wide pricing of carbon is the centre piece of any policy designed to reduce emissions at the lowest possible costs Ross Garnaut lead author of the Garnaut Climate Change Review   Some economists have urged the use of market-based instruments such as emissions trading to address environmental problems instead of prescriptive \"command-and-control\" regulation   Command and control regulation is criticized for being insensitive to geographical and technological differences and therefore inefficient   however this is not always so as shown by the WW-II rationing program in the U S in which local and regional boards made adjustments for these differences   After an emissions limit has been set by a government political process individual companies are free to choose how or whether to reduce their emissions Failure to report emissions and surrender emission permits is often punishable by a further government regulatory mechanism such as a fine that increases costs of production Firms will choose the least-cost way to comply with the pollution regulation which will lead to reductions where the least expensive solutions exist while allowing emissions that are more expensive to reduce Under an emissions trading system each regulated polluter has flexibility to use the most cost-effective combination of buying or selling emission permits reducing its emissions by installing cleaner technology or reducing its emissions by reducing production The most cost-effective strategy depends on the polluter's marginal abatement cost and the market price of permits In theory a polluter's decisions should lead to an economically efficient allocation of reductions among polluters and lower compliance costs for individual firms and for the economy overall compared to command-and-control mechanisms     Emission markets edit For emissions trading where greenhouse gases are regulated one emissions permit is considered equivalent to one metric ton of carbon dioxide CO   emissions Other names for emissions permits are carbon credits Kyoto units assigned amount units and Certified Emission Reduction units CER These permits can be sold privately or in the international market at the prevailing market price These trade and settle internationally and hence allow permits to be transferred between countries Each international transfer is validated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC Each transfer of ownership within the European Union is additionally validated by the European Commission Emissions trading programmes such as the European Union Emissions Trading System EU ETS complement the country-to-country trading stipulated in the Kyoto Protocol by allowing private trading of permits Under such programmes which are generally co-ordinated with the national emissions targets provided within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol a national or international authority allocates permits to individual companies based on established criteria with a view to meeting national and/or regional Kyoto targets at the lowest overall economic cost   Trading exchanges have been established to provide a spot market in permits as well as futures and options market to help discover a market price and maintain liquidity Carbon prices are normally quoted in euros per tonne of carbon dioxide or its equivalent CO   e Other greenhouse gases can also be traded but are quoted as standard multiples of carbon dioxide with respect to their global warming potential These features reduce the quota's financial impact on business while ensuring that the quotas are met at a national and international level Currently there are six exchanges trading in UNFCCC related carbon credits the Chicago Climate Exchange until     European Climate Exchange NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe PowerNext Commodity Exchange Bratislava and the European Energy Exchange NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe listed a contract to trade offsets generated by a CDM carbon project called Certified Emission Reductions Many companies now engage in emissions abatement offsetting and sequestration programs to generate credits that can be sold on one of the exchanges At least one private electronic market has been established in   CantorCO2e   Carbon credits at Commodity Exchange Bratislava are traded at special platform called Carbon place   Trading in emission permits is one of the fastest-growing segments in financial services in the City of London with a market estimated to be worth about   billion in   Louis Redshaw head of environmental markets at Barclays Capital predicts that \"carbon will be the world's biggest commodity market and it could become the world's biggest market overall \"   Pollution markets edit An emission license directly confers a right to emit pollutants up to a certain rate In contrast a pollution license for a given location confers the right to emit pollutants at a rate which will cause no more than a specified increase at the pollution-level For concreteness consider the following model   There are n { displaystyle n} agents each of which emits e i { displaystyle e {i}} pollutants There are m { displaystyle m} locations each of which suffers pollution q i { displaystyle q {i}} The pollution is a linear combination of the emissions The relation between e { displaystyle e} and q { displaystyle q} is given by a diffusion matrix H { displaystyle H} such that q = H e { displaystyle q=H cdot e} As an example consider three countries along a river as in the fair river sharing setting Pollution in the upstream country is determined only by the emission of the upstream country q   = e   { displaystyle q {1}=e {1}} Pollution in the middle country is determined by its own emission and by the emission of country   q   = e   + e   { displaystyle q {2}=e {1}+e {2}} Pollution in the downstream country is the sum of all emissions q   = e   + e   + e   { displaystyle q {3}=e {1}+e {2}+e {3}} So the matrix H { displaystyle H} in this case is a triangular matrix of ones Each pollution-license for location i { displaystyle i} permits its holder to emit pollutants that will cause at most this level of pollution at location i { displaystyle i} Therefore a polluter that affects water quality at a number of points has to hold a portfolio of licenses covering all relevant monitoring-points In the above example if country   wants to emit a unit of pollutant it should purchase two permits one for location   and one for location   Montgomery shows that while both markets lead to efficient license allocation the market in pollution-licenses is more widely applicable than the market in emission-licenses   History edit The international community began the long process towards building effective international and domestic measures to tackle GHG emissions carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydroflurocarbons perfluorocarbons sulphur hexafluoride in response to the increasing assertions that global warming is happening due to man-made emissions and the uncertainty over its likely consequences That process began in Rio in   when   countries agreed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC The UNFCCC is as its title suggests simply a framework the necessary detail was left to be settled by the Conference of Parties CoP to the UNFCCC   The efficiency of what later was to be called the \"cap-and-trade\" approach to air pollution abatement was first demonstrated in a series of micro-economic computer simulation studies between   and   for the National Air Pollution Control Administration predecessor to the United States Environmental Protection Agency 's Office of Air and Radiation by Ellison Burton and William Sanjour These studies used mathematical models of several cities and their emission sources in order to compare the cost and effectiveness of various control strategies           Each abatement strategy was compared with the \"least-cost solution\" produced by a computer optimization program to identify the least-costly combination of source reductions in order to achieve a given abatement goal In each case it was found that the least-cost solution was dramatically less costly than the same amount of pollution reduction produced by any conventional abatement strategy   Burton and later Sanjour along with Edward H Pechan continued improving   and advancing   these computer models at the newly created U S Environmental Protection Agency The agency introduced the concept of computer modeling with least-cost abatement strategies i e emissions trading in its   annual report to Congress on the cost of clean air   This led to the concept of \"cap and trade\" as a means of achieving the \"least-cost solution\" for a given level of abatement The development of emissions trading over the course of its history can be divided into four phases   Gestation Theoretical articulation of the instrument by Coase   Crocker   Dales   Montgomery   etc and independent of the former tinkering with \"flexible regulation\" at the US Environmental Protection Agency Proof of Principle First developments towards trading of emission certificates based on the \"offset-mechanism\" taken up in Clean Air Act in   A company could get allowance from the Act on a greater amount of emission when it paid another company to reduce the same pollutant   Prototype Launching of a first \"cap-and-trade\" system as part of the US Acid Rain Program in Title IV of the   Clean Air Act officially announced as a paradigm shift in environmental policy as prepared by \"Project 88\" a network-building effort to bring together environmental and industrial interests in the US Regime formation branching out from the US clean air policy to global climate policy and from there to the European Union along with the expectation of an emerging global carbon market and the formation of the \"carbon industry\" In the United States the \" acid rain \"-related emission trading system was principally conceived by C Boyden Gray a G H W Bush administration attorney Gray worked with the Environmental Defense Fund EDF who worked with the EPA to write the bill that became law as part of the Clean Air Act of   The new emissions cap on NO x and SO   gases took effect in   and according to Smithsonian magazine those acid rain emissions dropped   million tons that year   In   the CoP agreed in what has been described as a watershed in international environmental treaty making the Kyoto Protocol where   developed countries Annex   countries committed themselves to targets and timetables for the reduction of GHGs   These targets for developed countries are often referred to as Assigned Amounts One important economic reality recognised by many of the countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol is that if countries have to solely rely on their own domestic measures the resulting inflexible limitations on GHG growth could entail very large costs perhaps running into many trillions of dollars globally   As a result international mechanisms which would allow developed countries flexibility to meet their targets were included in the Kyoto Protocol The purpose of these mechanisms is to allow the parties to find the most economic ways to achieve their targets These international mechanisms are outlined under Kyoto Protocol   On April     the Environmental Protection Agency EPA formally announced that it had found that greenhouse gas GHG poses a threat to public health and the environment EPA 2009a This announcement was significant because it gives the executive branch the authority to impose carbon regulations on carbon-emitting entities   A carbon cap-and-trade system is to be introduced nationwide in China in     China's National Development and Reform Commission proposed that an absolute cap be placed on emission by     Public opinion edit In the United States most polling shows large support for emissions trading often referred to as cap-and-trade This majority support can be seen in polls conducted by Washington Post / ABC News   Zogby International   and Yale University   A new Washington Post-ABC poll reveals that majorities of the American people believe in climate change are concerned about it are willing to change their lifestyles and pay more to address it and want the federal government to regulate greenhouse gases They are however ambivalent on cap-and-trade   More than three-quarters of respondents   0% reported they strongly support   0% or somewhat support   0% the EPA s decision to regulate carbon emissions While   6% of respondents reported being very willing   0% or somewhat willing   6% another   8% reported being somewhat unwilling   8% or not at all willing   0% to pay higher prices for Green energy sources to support funding for programs that reduce the effect of global warming   According to PolitiFact it is a misconception that emissions trading is unpopular in the United States because of earlier polls from Zogby International and Rasmussen which misleadingly include \"new taxes\" in the questions taxes aren't part of emissions trading or high energy cost estimates   Comparison with other methods of emission reduction edit Cap and trade is the textbook emissions trading program Other market-based approaches include baseline-and-credit and pollution tax They all put a price on pollution for example see carbon price and so provide an economic incentive to reduce pollution beginning with the lowest-cost opportunities By contrast in a command-and-control approach a central authority designates pollution levels each facility is allowed to emit Cap and trade essentially functions as a tax where the tax rate is variable based on the relative cost of abatement per unit and the tax base is variable based on the amount of abatement needed citation needed Baseline and credit edit In a baseline and credit program polluters can create permits called credits or offsets by reducing their emissions below a baseline level which is often the historical emissions level from a designated past year   Such credits can be bought by polluters that have a regulatory limit   Pollution tax edit Emissions fees or environmental tax is a surcharge on the pollution created while producing goods and services   For example a carbon tax is a tax on the carbon content of fossil fuels that aims to discourage their use and thereby reduce carbon dioxide emissions   The two approaches are overlapping sets of policy designs Both can have a range of scopes points of regulation and price schedules They can be fair or unfair depending on how the revenue is used Both have the effect of increasing the price of goods such as fossil fuels to consumers   A comprehensive upstream auctioned cap-and-trade system is very similar to a comprehensive upstream carbon tax Yet many commentators sharply contrast the two approaches The main difference is what is defined and what derived A tax is a price control while cap-and-trade method acts is a quantity control instrument   That is a tax is a unit price for pollution that is set by authorities and the market determines the quantity emitted in cap and trade authorities determine the amount of pollution and the market determines the price   This difference affects a number of criteria   Responsiveness to inflation Cap-and-trade has the advantage that it adjusts to inflation changes to overall prices automatically while emissions fees must be changed by regulators Responsiveness to cost changes It is not clear which approach is better It is possible to combine the two into a safety valve price a price set by regulators at which polluters can buy additional permits beyond the cap Responsiveness to recessions This point is closely related to responsiveness to cost changes because recessions cause a drop in demand Under cap and trade the emissions cost automatically decreases so a cap-and-trade scheme adds another automatic stabilizer to the economy - in effect an automatic fiscal stimulus However a lower pollution price also results in reduced efforts to reduce pollution If the government is able to stimulate the economy regardless of the cap-and-trade scheme an excessively low price causes a missed opportunity to cut emissions faster than planned Instead it might be better to have a price floor a tax This is especially true when cutting pollution is urgent as with greenhouse gas emissions A price floor also provides certainty and stability for investment in emissions reductions recent experience from the UK shows that nuclear power operators are reluctant to invest on \"un-subsidised\" terms unless there is a guaranteed price floor for carbon which the EU emissions trading scheme does not presently provide Responsiveness to uncertainty As with cost changes in a world of uncertainty it is not clear whether emissions fees or cap-and-trade systems are more efficient it depends on how fast the marginal social benefits of reducing pollution fall with the amount of cleanup e g whether inelastic or elastic marginal social benefit schedule Other The magnitude of the tax will depend on how sensitive the supply of emissions is to the price The permit price of cap-and-trade will depend on the pollutant market A tax generates government revenue but full-auctioned emissions permits can do the same A similar upstream cap-and-trade system could be implemented An upstream carbon tax might be the simplest to administer Setting up a complex cap-and-trade arrangement that is comprehensive has high institutional needs   Command-and-control regulation edit Command and control is a system of regulation that prescribes emission limits and compliance methods for each facility or source It is the traditional approach to reducing air pollution   Command-and-control regulations are more rigid than incentive-based approaches such as pollution fees and cap and trade An example of this is a performance standard which sets an emissions goal for each polluter that is fixed and therefore the burden of reducing pollution cannot be shifted to the firms that can achieve it more cheaply As a result performance standards are likely to be more costly overall   The additional costs would be passed to end consumers   Economics of international emissions trading edit Part of a series on World

symmetry theorem Terms of trade v t e It is possible for a country to reduce emissions using a Command-Control approach such as regulation direct and indirect taxes The cost of that approach differs between countries because the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve MAC the cost of eliminating an additional unit of pollution differs by country It might cost China $2 to eliminate a ton of CO   but it would probably cost Norway or the U S much more International emissions-trading markets were created precisely to exploit differing MACs Example edit Emissions trading through Gains from Trade can be more beneficial for both the buyer and the seller than a simple emissions capping scheme Consider two European countries such as Germany and Sweden Each can either reduce all the required amount of emissions by itself or it can choose to buy or sell in the market Example MACs for two different countries Suppose Germany can abate its CO   at a much cheaper cost than Sweden i e MAC S > MAC G where the MAC curve of Sweden is steeper higher slope than that of Germany and R Req is the total amount of emissions that need to be reduced by a country On the left side of the graph is the MAC curve for Germany R Req is the amount of required reductions for Germany but at R Req the MAC G curve has not intersected the market emissions permit price of CO   market permit price = P = Thus given the market price of CO   allowances Germany has potential to profit if it abates more emissions than required On the right side is the MAC curve for Sweden R Req is the amount of required reductions for Sweden but the MAC S curve already intersects the market price of CO   permits before R Req has been reached Thus given the market price of CO   permits Sweden has potential to make a cost saving if it abates fewer emissions than required internally and instead abates them elsewhere In this example Sweden would abate emissions until its MAC S intersects with P at R* but this would only reduce a fraction of Sweden's total required abatement After that it could buy emissions credits from Germany for the price P per unit The internal cost of Sweden's own abatement combined with the permits it buys in the market from Germany adds up to the total required reductions R Req for Sweden Thus Sweden can make a saving from buying permits in the market d-e-f This represents the \"Gains from Trade\" the amount of additional expense that Sweden would otherwise have to spend if it abated all of its required emissions by itself without trading Germany made a profit on its additional emissions abatement above what was required it met the regulations by abating all of the emissions that was required of it R Req Additionally Germany sold its surplus permits to Sweden and was paid P for every unit it abated while spending less than P Its total revenue is the area of the graph R Req     R* its total abatement cost is area R Req     R* and so its net benefit from selling emission permits is the area 1-2-3 i e Gains from Trade The two R* on both graphs represent the efficient allocations that arise from trading Germany sold R* - R Req emission permits to Sweden at a unit price P Sweden bought emission permits from Germany at a unit price P If the total cost for reducing a particular amount of emissions in the Command Control scenario is called X then to reduce the same amount of combined pollution in Sweden and Germany the total abatement cost would be less in the Emissions Trading scenario i e X   - def The example above applies not just at the national level but also between two companies in different countries or between two subsidiaries within the same company Applying the economic theory edit The nature of the pollutant plays a very important role when policy-makers decide which framework should be used to control pollution CO   acts globally thus its impact on the environment is generally similar wherever in the globe it is released So the location of the originator of the emissions does not matter from an environmental standpoint   The policy framework should be different for regional pollutants   e g SO   and NO x and also mercury because the impact of these pollutants may differ by location The same amount of a regional pollutant can exert a very high impact in some locations and a low impact in other locations so it matters where the pollutant is released This is known as the Hot Spot problem A Lagrange framework is commonly used to determine the least cost of achieving an objective in this case the total reduction in emissions required in a year In some cases it is possible to use the Lagrange optimization framework to determine the required reductions for each country based on their MAC so that the total cost of reduction is minimized In such a scenario the Lagrange multiplier represents the market allowance price P of a pollutant such as the current market price of emission permits in Europe and the USA   Countries face the permit market price that exists in the market that day so they are able to make individual decisions that would minimize their costs while at the same time achieving regulatory compliance This is also another version of the Equi-Marginal Principle commonly used in economics to choose the most economically efficient decision Prices versus quantities and the safety valve edit There has been longstanding debate on the relative merits of price versus quantity instruments to achieve emission reductions   An emission cap and permit trading system is a quantity instrument because it fixes the overall emission level quantity and allows the price to vary Uncertainty in future supply and demand conditions market volatility coupled with a fixed number of pollution permits creates an uncertainty in the future price of pollution permits and the industry must accordingly bear the cost of adapting to these volatile market conditions The burden of a volatile market thus lies with the industry rather than the controlling agency which is generally more efficient However under volatile market conditions the ability of the controlling agency to alter the caps will translate into an ability to pick \"winners and losers\" and thus presents an opportunity for corruption In contrast an emission tax is a price instrument because it fixes the price while the emission level is allowed to vary according to economic activity A major drawback of an emission tax is that the environmental outcome e g a limit on the amount of emissions is not guaranteed On one hand a tax will remove capital from the industry suppressing possibly useful economic activity but conversely the polluter will not need to hedge as much against future uncertainty since the amount of tax will track with profits The burden of a volatile market will be borne by the controlling taxing agency rather than the industry itself which is generally less efficient An advantage is that given a uniform tax rate and a volatile market the taxing entity will not be in a position to pick \"winners and losers\" and the opportunity for corruption will be less Assuming no corruption and assuming that the controlling agency and the industry are equally efficient at adapting to volatile market conditions the best choice depends on the sensitivity of the costs of emission reduction compared to the sensitivity of the benefits i e climate damage avoided by a reduction when the level of emission control is varied Because there is high uncertainty in the compliance costs of firms some argue that the optimum choice is the price mechanism However the burden of uncertainty cannot be eliminated and in this case it is shifted to the taxing agency itself The overwhelming majority of climate scientists have repeatedly warned of a threshold in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide beyond which a run-away warming effect could take place with a large possibility of causing irreversible damage With such a risk a quantity instrument may be a better choice because the quantity of emissions may be capped with more certainty However this may not be true if this risk exists but cannot be attached to a known level of greenhouse gas GHG concentration or a known emission pathway   A third option known as a safety valve is a hybrid of the price and quantity instruments The system is essentially an emission cap and permit trading system but the maximum or minimum permit price is capped Emitters have the choice of either obtaining permits in the marketplace or buying them from the government at a specified trigger price which could be adjusted over time The system is sometimes recommended as a way of overcoming the fundamental disadvantages of both systems by giving governments the flexibility to adjust the system as new information comes to light It can be shown that by setting the trigger price high enough or the number of permits low enough the safety valve can be used to mimic either a pure quantity or pure price mechanism   All three methods are being used as policy instruments to control greenhouse gas emissions the EU-ETS is a quantity system using the cap and trading system to meet targets set by National Allocation Plans Denmark has a price system using a carbon tax World Bank   p     while China uses the CO   market price for funding of its Clean Development Mechanism projects but imposes a safety valve of a minimum price per tonne of CO   Carbon leakage edit Carbon leakage is the effect that regulation of emissions in one country/sector has on the emissions in other countries/sectors that are not subject to the same regulation   There is no consensus over the magnitude of long-term carbon leakage   In the Kyoto Protocol Annex I countries are subject to caps on emissions but non-Annex I countries are not Barker et al   assessed the literature on leakage The leakage rate is defined as the increase in CO   emissions outside the countries taking domestic mitigation action divided by the reduction in emissions of countries taking domestic mitigation action Accordingly a leakage rate greater than 100% means that actions to reduce emissions within countries had the effect of increasing emissions in other countries to a greater extent i e domestic mitigation action had actually led to an increase in global emissions Estimates of leakage rates for action under the Kyoto Protocol ranged from 5% to 20% as a result of a loss in price competitiveness but these leakage rates were considered very uncertain   For energy-intensive industries the beneficial effects of Annex I actions through technological development were considered possibly substantial However this beneficial effect had not been reliably quantified On the empirical evidence they assessed Barker et al   concluded that the competitive losses of then-current mitigation actions e g the EU ETS were not significant Under the EU ETS rules Carbon Leakage Exposure Factor is used to determine the volumes of free allocation of emission permits to industrial installations Trade edit To understand carbon trading it is important to understand the products that are being traded The primary product in carbon markets is the trading of GHG emission permits Under a cap-and-trade system permits are issued to various entities for the right to emit GHG emissions that meet emission reduction requirement caps   One of the controversies about carbon mitigation policy is how to \"level the playing field\" with border adjustments   For example one component of the American Clean Energy and Security Act a   bill that did not pass along with several other energy bills put before US Congress calls for carbon surcharges on goods imported from countries without cap-and-trade programs Besides issues of compliance with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade such border adjustments presume that the producing countries bear responsibility for the carbon emissions A general perception among developing countries is that discussion of climate change in trade negotiations could lead to \"green protectionism \" by high-income countries World Bank   p     Tariffs on imports \"virtual carbon\" consistent with a carbon price of $50 per ton of CO   could be significant for developing countries World Bank   commented that introducing border tariffs could lead to a proliferation of trade measures where the competitive playing field is viewed as being uneven Tariffs could also be a burden on low-income countries that have contributed very little to the problem of climate change Trading systems edit Carbon emission trading and carbon tax around the world Emission trading implemented Emission trading scheduled Carbon tax implemented Carbon tax scheduled Emission trading or carbon tax under consideration Kyoto Protocol edit In   the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC report highlighted the imminent threat of climate change and greenhouse gas emission and diplomatic efforts began to find an international framework within which such emissions could be regulated In   the Kyoto Protocol was adopted The Kyoto Protocol is a   international treaty that came into force in   In the treaty most developed nations agreed to legally binding targets for their emissions of the six major greenhouse gases   Emission quotas known as \"Assigned amounts\" were agreed by each participating 'Annex I' country with the intention of reducing the overall emissions by   2% from their   levels by the end of   Between   and   the original Kyoto Protocol parties reduced their CO2 emissions by   5% which is well beyond the   target of   7% The United States is the only industrialized nation under Annex I that has not ratified the treaty and is therefore not bound by it The IPCC has projected that the financial effect of compliance through trading within the Kyoto commitment period will be limited at between   1-1 1% of GDP among trading countries   The agreement was intended to result in industrialized countries' emissions declining in aggregate by     percent below   levels by the year of   Despite the failure of the United States and Australia to ratify the protocol the agreement became effective in   once the requirement that   Annex I predominantly industrialized countries jointly accounting for   percent of   Annex I emissions ratify the agreement was met   The Protocol defines several mechanisms \" flexible mechanisms \" that are designed to allow Annex I countries to meet their emission reduction commitments caps with reduced economic impact   Under Article     of the Kyoto Protocol Annex I Parties may use GHG removals from afforestation and reforestation forest sinks and deforestation sources since   to meet their emission reduction commitments   Annex I Parties may also use International Emissions Trading IET Under the treaty for the 5-year compliance period from   until     nations that emit less than their quota will be able to sell assigned amount units each AAU representing an allowance to emit one metric tonne of CO   to nations that exceed their quotas   It is also possible for Annex I countries to sponsor carbon projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other countries These projects generate tradable carbon credits that can be used by Annex I countries in meeting their caps The project-based Kyoto Mechanisms are the Clean Development Mechanism CDM and Joint Implementation JI There are four such international flexible mechanisms or Kyoto Mechanism   written in the Kyoto Protocol Article   if the Protocol authorizes Annex   countries that have agreed to the emissions limitations to take part in emissions trading with other Annex   Countries Article   authorizes such parties to implement their limitations jointly as the member states of the EU have chosen to do Article   provides that such Annex   countries may take part in joint initiatives JIs in return for emissions reduction units ERUs to be used against their Assigned Amounts Art   provides for a mechanism known as the clean development mechanism CDM   under which Annex   countries may invest in emissions limitation projects in developing countries and use certified emissions reductions CERs generated against their own Assigned Amounts   The CDM covers projects taking place in non-Annex I countries while JI covers projects taking place in Annex I countries CDM projects are supposed to contribute to sustainable development in developing countries and also generate \"real\" and \"additional\" emission savings i e savings that only occur thanks to the CDM project in question Carbon Trust   p     Whether or not these emission savings are genuine is however difficult to prove World Bank   pp       Australia edit Main articles Garnaut Climate Change Review Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and Clean Energy Bill   In   the New South Wales NSW state government unilaterally established the NSW Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme   to reduce emissions by requiring electricity generators and large consumers to purchase NSW Greenhouse Abatement Certificates NGACs This has prompted the rollout of free energy-efficient compact fluorescent lightbulbs and other energy-efficiency measures funded by the credits This scheme has been criticised by the Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets CEEM of the UNSW because of its lack of effectiveness in reducing emissions its lack of transparency and its lack of verification of the additionality of emission reductions   Both the incumbent Howard Coalition government and the Rudd Labor opposition promised to implement an emissions trading scheme ETS before the   federal election Labor won the election with the new government proceeding to implement an ETS The government introduced the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme which the Liberals supported with Malcolm Turnbull as leader Tony Abbott questioned an ETS saying the best way to reduce emissions is with a \"simple tax\"   Shortly before the carbon vote Abbott defeated Turnbull in a leadership challenge and from there on the Liberals opposed the ETS This left the government unable to secure passage of the bill and it was subsequently withdrawn Julia Gillard defeated Rudd in a leadership challenge and promised not to introduce a carbon tax but would look to legislate a price on carbon   when taking the government to the   election In the first hung parliament result in   years the government required the support of crossbenchers including the Greens One requirement for Greens support was a carbon price which Gillard proceeded with in forming a minority government A fixed carbon price would proceed to a floating-price ETS within a few years under the plan The fixed price lent itself to characterisation as a carbon tax and when the government proposed the Clean Energy Bill in February     the opposition claimed it to be a broken election promise   The bill was passed by the Lower House in October     and the Upper House in November     The Liberal Party vowed to overturn the bill if elected   The bill thus resulted in passage of the Clean Energy Act which possessed a great deal of flexibility in its design and uncertainty over its future The Liberal/National coalition government elected in September   has promised to reverse the climate legislation of the previous government   In July   the carbon tax was repealed as well as the Emissions Trading Scheme ETS that was to start in     New Zealand edit   New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme and Climate change in New Zealand New Zealand Unit Prices The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme NZ ETS is a partial-coverage all-free allocation uncapped highly internationally linked emissions trading scheme The NZ ETS was first legislated in the Climate Change Response Emissions Trading Amendment Act   in September   under the Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand     and then amended in November     and in November     by the Fifth National Government of New Zealand The NZ ETS covers forestry a net sink energy   4% of total   emissions industry   7% of total   emissions and waste   8% of total   emissions but not pastoral agriculture 47% of   total emissions   Participants in the NZ ETS must surrender two emissions units either an international 'Kyoto' unit or a New Zealand-issued unit for every three tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions reported or they may choose to buy NZ units from the government at a fixed price of NZ$25   Individual sectors of the economy have different entry dates when their obligations to report emissions and surrender emission units take effect Forestry which contributed net removals of     Mts of CO   e in   19% of NZ's   emissions   entered the NZ ETS on   January     The stationary energy industrial processes and liquid fossil fuel sectors entered the NZ ETS on   July   The waste sector landfill operators entered on   January     Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from pastoral agriculture are not included in the NZ ETS From November   agriculture was to enter the NZ ETS on   January     The NZ ETS is highly linked to international carbon markets as it allows the importing of most of the Kyoto Protocol emission units However as of June   the scheme will effectively transition into a domestic scheme with restricted access to international Kyoto units CERs ERUs and RMUs   The NZ ETS has a domestic unit the 'New Zealand Unit' NZU which is issued by free allocation to emitters with no auctions intended in the short term   Free allocation of NZUs varies between sectors The commercial fishery sector who are not participants have a free allocation of units on a historic basis   Owners of pre-1990 forests have received a fixed free allocation of units   Free allocation to emissions-intensive industry     is provided on an output-intensity basis For this sector there is no set limit on the number of units that may be allocated   The number of units allocated to eligible emitters is based on the average emissions per unit of output within a defined 'activity'   Bertram and Terry   p   state that as the NZ ETS does not 'cap' emissions the NZ ETS is not a cap and trade scheme as understood in the economics literature   Some stakeholders have criticized the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme for its generous free allocations of emission units and the lack of a carbon price signal the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment   and for being ineffective in reducing emissions Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand   The NZ ETS was reviewed in late   by an independent panel which reported to the Government and public in September     European Union edit   European Union Emission Trading Scheme The European Union Emission Trading Scheme or EU ETS is the largest multi-national greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world It is one of the EU's central policy instruments to meet their cap set in the Kyoto Protocol   After voluntary trials in the UK and Denmark Phase I began operation in January   with all   member states of the European Union participating   The program caps the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted from large installations with a net heat supply in excess of   MW such as power plants and carbon intensive factories   and covers almost half 46% of the EU's Carbon Dioxide emissions   Phase I permits participants to trade among themselves and in validated credits from the developing world through Kyoto's Clean Development Mechanism Credits are gained by investing in clean technologies and low-carbon solutions and by certain types of emission-saving projects around the world to cover a proportion of their emissions   During Phases I and II allowances for emissions have typically been given free to firms which has resulted in them getting windfall profits   Ellerman and Buchner   suggested that during its first two years in operation the EU ETS turned an expected increase in emissions of 1%-2% per year into a small absolute decline Grubb et al   suggested that a reasonable estimate for the emissions cut achieved during its first two years of operation was 50-100 MtCO   per year or   5%-5%   A number of design flaws have limited the effectiveness of the scheme   In the initial 2005-07 period emission caps were not tight enough to drive a significant reduction in emissions   The total allocation of allowances turned out to exceed actual emissions This drove the carbon price down to zero in   This oversupply was caused because the allocation of allowances by the EU was based on emissions data from the European Environmental Agency in Copenhagen which uses a horizontal activity-based emissions definition similar to the United Nations the EU ETS Transaction log in Brussels but a vertical installation-based emissions measurement system This caused an oversupply of   million tonnes 10% of market in the EU ETS in the first phase and collapsing prices   Phase II saw some tightening but the use of JI and CDM offsets was allowed with the result that no reductions in the EU will be required to meet the Phase II cap   For Phase II the cap is expected to result in an emissions reduction in   of about   4% compared to expected emissions without the cap business-as-usual emissions   For Phase III     the European Commission proposed a number of changes including Setting an overall EU cap with allowances then allocated t Tighter limits on the use of offsets Unlimited banking of allowances between Phases II and III A move from allowances to auctioning In January   Norway Iceland and Liechtenstein joined the European Union Emissions Trading System EU ETS according to a publication from the European Commission   The Norwegian Ministry of the Environment has also released its draft National Allocation Plan which provides a carbon cap-and-trade of   million metric tonnes of CO     million of which are set to be auctioned   According to the OECD Economic Survey of Norway   the nation \"has announced a target for 2008-12 10% below its commitment under the Kyoto Protocol and a 30% cut compared with   by   \"   In   EU-15 emissions was   1% below their base year level Based on figures for   by the European Environment Agency EU-15 emissions averaged   8% below base-year levels during the 2008-2012 period This means the EU-15 over-achieved its first Kyoto target by a wide margin   Tokyo Japan edit   Tokyo Metropolitan Government The Japanese city of Tokyo is like a country in its own right in terms of its energy consumption and GDP Tokyo consumes as much energy as \"entire countries in Northern Europe and its production matches the GNP of the world's 16th largest country\" A scheme to limit carbon emissions launched in April   covers the top     emitters in Tokyo and is enforced and overseen by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government     Phase   which is similar to Japan's scheme ran until   Japan had an ineffective voluntary emissions reductions system for years   but no nationwide cap-and-trade program Emitters must cut their emissions by 6% or 8% depending on the type of organization from   those who exceed their limits must buy matching allowances or invest in renewable-energy certificates or offset credits issued by smaller businesses or branch offices   Polluters that fail to comply will be fined up to     yen plus credits for     times excess emissions   In its fourth year emissions were reduced by 23% compared to base-year emissions   In phase   FY2015-FY2019 the target is expected to increase to 15%-17% The aim is to cut Tokyo's carbon emissions by 25% from   levels by     These emission limits can be met by using technologies such as solar panels and advanced fuel-saving devices   United States edit Sulfur dioxide edit   Acid Rain Program An early example of an emission trading system has been the sulfur dioxide SO   trading system under the framework of the Acid Rain Program of the   Clean Air Act in the U S Under the program which is essentially a cap-and-trade emissions trading system SO   emissions were reduced by 50% from   levels by     Some experts argue that the cap-and-trade system of SO   emissions reduction has reduced the cost of controlling acid rain by as much as 80% versus source-by-source reduction     The SO   program was challenged in   which set in motion a series of events that led to the   Cross-State Air Pollution Rule CSAPR Under the CSAPR the national SO   trading program was replaced by four separate trading groups for SO   and NO x   SO   emissions from Acid Rain Program sources have fallen from     million tons in   to about     million tons in   a decrease in emissions of   percent A   EPA analysis esimated that implementation of the Acid Rain Program avoided between     and     incidences of premature mortality annually due to reductions of ambient PM2   concentrations and between   and     incidences annually due to reductions of ground-level ozone   not in citation given Nitrogen oxides edit In   the Environmental Protection Agency EPA began to administer the NOx Budget Trading Program NBP under the NOx State Implementation Plan also known as the \"NOx SIP Call\" The NOx Budget Trading Program was a market-based cap and trade program created to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides NO x from power plants and other large combustion sources in the eastern United States NO x is a prime ingredient in the formation of ground-level ozone smog a pervasive air pollution problem in many areas of the eastern United States The NBP was designed to reduce NO x emissions during the warm summer months referred to as the ozone season when ground-level ozone concentrations are highest   In March   EPA again strengthened the 8-hour ozone standard to     parts per million ppm from its previous     ppm   Ozone season NOx emissions decreased by   percent between   and   even while energy demand remained essentially flat during the same period CAIR will result in $85 billion to $100 billion in health benefits and nearly $2 billion in visibility benefits per year by   and will substantially reduce premature mortality in the eastern United States citation needed NOx reductions due to the NOx Budget Trading Program have led to improvements in ozone and PM2   saving an estimated   to     lives in     not in citation given A   study in the American Economic Review found that the NOx Budget Trading Program decreased NOx emissions and ambient ozone concentrations   The program reduced expenditures on medicine by about   5% $800 million annually and reduced the mortality rate by up to   5%     fewer premature deaths mainly among individuals   and older   Volatile organic compounds edit Classification of Organic Pollutants In the United States the Environmental Protection Agency EPA classifies Volatile Organic Compounds VOCs as gases emitted from certain solids and liquids that may have adverse health effects   These VOCs include a variety of chemicals that are emitted from a variety of different products   These include products such as gasoline perfumes hair spray fabric cleaners PVC and refrigerants all of which can contain chemicals such as benzene acetone methylene chloride freons formaldehyde   VOCs are also monitored by the United States Geological Survey for its presence in groundwater supply   The USGS concluded that many of the nations aquifers are at risk to low-level VOC contamination   The common symptoms of short levels of exposure to VOCs include headaches nausea and eye irritation   If exposed for an extended period of time the symptoms include cancer and damage to the central nervous system   Greenhouse gases edit   Climate change in the United States As of   there is no national emissions trading scheme in the United States Failing to get Congressional approval for such a scheme President Barack Obama instead acted through the United States Environmental Protection Agency to attempt to adopt through rulemaking the Clean Power Plan which does not feature emissions trading The plan was subsequently challenged and is under review by the administration of President Donald Trump Concerned at the lack of federal action several states on the east and west coasts have created sub-national cap-and-trade programs State and regional programs edit In   New York State proposed and attained commitments from nine Northeast states to form a cap-and-trade carbon dioxide emissions program for power generators called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative RGGI This program launched on January     with the aim to reduce the carbon \"budget\" of each state's electricity generation sector to 10% below their   allowances by     Also in   U S corporations were able to trade CO   emission allowances on the Chicago Climate Exchange under a voluntary scheme In August   the Exchange announced a mechanism to create emission offsets for projects within the United States that cleanly destroy ozone -depleting substances   In   the California Legislature passed the California Global Warming Solutions Act AB-32 which was signed into law by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger Thus far flexible mechanisms in the form of project based offsets have been suggested for three main project types The project types include manure management forestry and destruction of ozone-depleted substances However a ruling from Judge Ernest H Goldsmith of San Francisco's Superior Court stated that the rules governing California's cap-and-trade system were adopted without a proper analysis of alternative methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions   The tentative ruling issued on   January   argued that the California Air Resources Board violated state environmental law by failing to consider such alternatives If the decision is made final the state would not be allowed to implement its proposed cap-and-trade system until the California Air Resources Board fully complies with the California Environmental Quality Act   needs update California's cap-and-trade program ranks only second to the ETS European Trading System carbon market in the world   In   under the auction the reserve price which is the price per ton of CO2 permit is $10 Some of the emitters obtain allowances for free which is for the electric utilities industrial facilities and natural gas distributors whereas some of the others have to go to the auction   In   the Texas legislature approved a 10% reduction for the Highly Reactive Volatile Organic Compound HRVOC emission limit   This was followed by a 5% reduction for each subsequent year until a total of 25% percent reduction was achieved in     In February   five U S states and four Canadian provinces joined together to create the Western Climate Initiative WCI a regional greenhouse gas emissions trading system   In July   a meeting took place to further outline the cap-and-trade system   In November   Arizona Montana New Mexico Oregon Utah and Washington withdrew from the WCI     In   the State of Illinois adopted a trading program for volatile organic compounds in most of the Chicago area called the Emissions Reduction Market System   Beginning in   over   major sources of pollution in eight Illinois counties began trading pollution credits Failed federal effort edit President Barack Obama in his proposed   United States federal budget wanted to support clean energy development with a 10-year investment of US $15 billion per year generated from the sale of greenhouse gas GHG emissions credits Under the proposed cap-and-trade program all GHG emissions credits would have been auctioned off generating an estimated $78   billion in additional revenue in FY   steadily increasing to $83 billion by FY     The proposal was never made law The American Clean Energy and Security Act H R   a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade bill was passed on   June   in the House of Representatives by a vote of 219-212 The bill originated in the House Energy and Commerce Committee and was introduced by Representatives Henry A Waxman and Edward J Markey   The political advocacy organizations FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity funded by brothers David and Charles Koch of Koch Industries encouraged the Tea Party movement to focus on defeating the legislation     Although cap and trade also gained a significant foothold in the Senate via the efforts of Republican Lindsey Graham Independent and former Democrat Joe Lieberman and Democrat John Kerry   the legislation died in the Senate   South Korea edit South Korea's national emissions trading scheme officially launched on   January   covering   entities from   sectors With a three-year cap of     billion tCO2e it now forms the second largest carbon market in the world following the EU ETS This amounts to roughly two thirds of the country's emissions The Korean emissions trading scheme is part of the Republic of Korea's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% compared to the business-as-usual scenario by     China edit In November   China approved pilot tests of carbon trading in seven provinces and cities Beijing Chongqing Shanghai Shenzhen Tianjin as well as Guangdong Province and Hubei Province with different prices in each region   The pilot is intended to test the waters and provide valuable lessons for the design of a national system in the near future Their successes or failures will therefore have far reaching implications for carbon market development in China in terms of trust in a national carbon trading market Some of the pilot regions can start trading as early as 2013/2014   National trading is expected to start in   latest in   China currently emits about 30% of global emissions and it became the largest emitter in the world When the market launched it will be the largest carbon market in the world It has made a voluntary pledge under the UNFCCC to lower CO2 per unit of GDP by   to 45% in   when comparing to the   levels   India edit Trading is set to begin in   after a three-year rollout period It is a mandatory energy efficiency trading scheme covering eight sectors responsible for   per cent of India s industrial energy consumption India has pledged a   to   per cent reduction in emissions intensity from   levels by   Under the scheme annual efficiency targets will be allocated to firms Tradable energy-saving permits will be issued depending on the amount of energy saved during a target year   Renewable energy certificates edit   Renewable Energy Certificates Renewable Energy Certificates occasionally referred to as or \"green tags\" citation required are a largely unrelated form of market-based instruments that are used to achieve renewable energy targets which may be environmentally motivated like emissions reduction targets but may also be motivated by other aims such as energy security or industrial policy Carbon market edit   Carbon emission trading Carbon emissions trading is emissions trading specifically for carbon dioxide calculated in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent or tCO   e and currently makes up the bulk of emissions trading It is one of the ways countries can meet their obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce carbon emissions and thereby mitigate global warming   personal carbon trading and carbon offset Market trend edit Trading can be done directly between buyers and sellers through several organised exchanges or through the many intermediaries active in the carbon market The price of allowances is determined by supply and demand As many as   million allowances have been traded per day In       billion allowances were traded with a total value of   billion   Carbon emissions trading declined in   and is expected to decline in     According to the World Bank 's Carbon Finance Unit   million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent tCO   e were exchanged through projects in   a 240% increase relative to     mtCO   e   which was itself a 41% increase relative to     mtCO   e   Global carbon markets have shrunk in value by 60% since   but are expected to rise again in     In terms of dollars the World Bank has estimated that the size of the carbon market was   billion USD in     billion USD in     and   billion in     The Marrakesh Accords of the Kyoto protocol defined the international trading mechanisms and registries needed to support trading between countries sources can buy or sell allowances on the open market Because the total number of allowances is limited by the cap emission reductions are assured   Allowance trading now occurs between European countries and Asian countries However while the USA as a nation did not ratify the Protocol many of its states are developing cap-and-trade systems and considering ways to link them together nationally and internationally to find the lowest costs and improve liquidity of the market   However these states also wish to preserve their individual integrity and unique features For example in contrast to other Kyoto-compliant systems some states propose other types of greenhouse gas sources different measurement methods setting a maximum on the price of allowances or restricting access to CDM projects Creating instruments that are not fungible exchangeable could introduce instability and make pricing difficult Various proposals for linking these systems across markets are being investigated and this is being coordinated by the International Carbon Action Partnership ICAP     Business reaction edit In   Barclays Capital predicted that the new carbon market would be worth $70 billion worldwide that year   The voluntary offset market by comparison is projected to grow to about $4bn by       multinational corporations came together in the G8 Climate Change Roundtable a business group formed at the January   World Economic Forum The group included Ford Toyota British Airways BP and Unilever On June     the Group published a statement stating the need to act on climate change and stressing the importance of market-based solutions It called on governments to establish \"clear transparent and consistent price signals\" through \"creation of a long-term policy framework\" that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases   By December   this had grown to encompass   global businesses   Business in the UK have come out strongly in support of emissions trading as a key tool to mitigate climate change supported by NGOs   However not all businesses favor a trading approach On December     Rex Tillerson the CEO of Exxonmobil said a carbon tax is \"a more direct more transparent and more effective approach\" than a cap-and-trade program which he said \"inevitably introduces unnecessary cost and complexity\" He also said that he hoped that the revenues from a carbon tax would be used to lower other taxes so as to be revenue neutral   The International Air Transport Association whose   member airlines comprise 93% of all international traffic position is that trading should be based on \"benchmarking\" setting emissions levels based on industry averages rather than \" grandfathering \" which would use individual companies previous emissions levels to set their future permit allowances They argue grandfathering \"would penalise airlines that took early action to modernise their fleets while a benchmarking approach if designed properly would reward more efficient operations\"   Measuring reporting verification edit This section needs additional citations for verification Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources Unsourced material may be challenged and removed September   Learn how and when to remove this template message Assuring compliance with an emissions trading scheme requires measuring reporting and verification MRV   Measurements are needed at each operator or installation These measurements are reported to a regulator For greenhouse gases all trading countries maintain an inventory of emissions at national and installation level in addition trading groups within North America maintain inventories at the state level through The Climate Registry For trading between regions these inventories must be consistent with equivalent units and measurement techniques   In some industrial processes emissions can be physically measured by inserting sensors and flowmeters in chimneys and stacks but many types of activity rely on theoretical calculations instead of measurement Depending on local legislation measurements may require additional checks and verification by government or third party auditors prior or post submission to the local regulator Enforcement edit In contrast to an ordinary market in a pollution market the amount purchased is not necessarily the amount 'consumed' = the amount of pollution emitted A firm might buy a small amount of allowances but emit a much larger amount of pollution This creates a troublesome moral hazard problem This problem may be solved by a centralized regulator The regulator should perform Measuring Reporting and Verification MRV of the actual pollution levels and enforce the allowances   Without effective MRV and enforcement the value of allowances diminishes Enforcement methods include fines and sanctions for polluters that have exceeded their allowances Concerns include the cost of MRV and enforcement and the risk that facilities may lie about actual emissions The net effect of a corrupt reporting system or poorly managed or financed regulator may be a discount on emission costs and a hidden increase in actual emissions According to Nordhaus strict enforcement of the Kyoto Protocol is likely to be observed in those countries and industries covered by the EU ETS   Ellerman and Buchner commented on the European Commission's EC's role in enforcing scarcity of permits within the EU ETS   This was done by the EC's reviewing the total number of permits that member states proposed that their industries be allocated Based on institutional and enforcement considerations Kruger et al suggested that emissions trading within developing countries might not be a realistic goal in the near-term   Burniaux et al argued that due to the difficulty in enforcing international rules against sovereign states development of the carbon market would require negotiation and consensus-building   An alternative to centralized regulation is distributed regulation in which the firms themselves are induced to inspect the other firms and report their misbehavior It is possible to implement such systems in subgame perfect equilibrium Moore and Repullo   present an implementation with unbounded fines Kahana and Mealem and Nitzan   present an implementation with bounded fines Their work extends the work of Duggan and Roberts   by adding a second component which takes care of the moral hazard Criticism edit Chicago Climate Justice activists protesting cap and trade legislation in front of Chicago Climate Exchange building in Chicago Loop Emissions trading has been criticised for a variety of reasons For example in the popular science magazine New Scientist Lohmann   argued that trading pollution allowances should be avoided as a climate stabilization policy for several reasons First climate change requires more radical changes than previous pollution trading schemes such as the US SO   market It requires reorganizing society and technology to \"leave most remaining fossil fuels safely underground\" Carbon trading schemes have tended to reward the heaviest polluters with 'windfall profits' when they are granted enough carbon credits to match historic production Expensive long-term structural changes will not be made if there are cheaper sources of carbon credits which are often available from less developed countries where they may be generated by local polluters at the expense of local communities   Research by Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg has shown that the flexibility and thus complexity inherent in cap and trade schemes has resulted in a great deal of policy uncertainty surrounding these schemes Such uncertainty has beset such schemes in Australia Canada China the EU India Japan New Zealand and the US As a result of this uncertainty organizations have little incentive to innovate and comply resulting in an ongoing battle of stakeholder contestation for the past two decades   Lohmann 2006b supported conventional regulation green taxes and energy policies that are \"justice-based\" and \"community-driven \"   According to Carbon Trade Watch   carbon trading has had a \"disastrous track record \" The effectiveness of the EU ETS was criticized and it was argued that the CDM had routinely favoured \"environmentally ineffective and socially unjust projects \"   Annie Leonard 's   documentary The Story of Cap and Trade criticized carbon emissions trading for the free permits to major polluters giving them unjust advantages cheating in connection with carbon offsets and as a distraction from the search for other solutions   Offsets edit Forest campaigner Jutta Kill   of European environmental group FERN argued that offsets for emission reductions were not substitute for actual cuts in emissions Kill stated that \" carbon in trees is temporary Trees can easily release carbon into the atmosphere through fire disease climatic changes natural decay and timber harvesting \"   Permit supply level edit Regulatory agencies run the risk of issuing too many emission credits which can result in a very low price on emission permits   This reduces the incentive that permit-liable firms have to cut back their emissions On the other hand issuing too few permits can result in an excessively high permit price   This an argument for a hybrid instrument having a price-floor i e a minimum permit price and a price-ceiling i e a limit on the permit price However a price-ceiling safety value removes the certainty of a particular quantity limit of emissions   Permit allocation versus auctioning edit If polluters receive emission permits for free \"grandfathering\" this may be a reason for them not to cut their emissions because if they do they will receive fewer permits in the future   This perverse incentive can be alleviated if permits are auctioned i e sold to polluters rather than giving them the permits for free   Auctioning is a method for distributing emission allowances in a cap-and-trade system whereby allowances are sold to the highest bidder Revenues from auctioning go to the government and can be used for development of sustainable technology   or to cut distortionary taxes thus improving the efficiency of the overall cap policy   On the other hand allocating permits can be used as a measure to protect domestic firms who are internationally exposed to competition   This happens when domestic firms compete against other firms that are not subject to the same regulation This argument in favor of allocation of permits has been used in the EU ETS where industries that have been judged to be internationally exposed e g cement and steel production have been given permits for free   This method of distribution may be combined with other forms of allowance distribution   Distributional effects edit The US Congressional Budget Office CBO   examined the potential effects of the American Clean Energy and Security Act on US households   This act relies heavily on the free allocation of permits The Bill was found to protect low-income consumers but it was recommended that the Bill be made more efficient by reducing welfare provisions for corporations and more resources be made available for consumer relief Linking edit Distinct cap-and-trade systems can be linked together through the mutual or unilateral recognition of emissions allowances for compliance Linking systems creates a larger carbon market which can reduce overall compliance costs increase market liquidity and generate a more stable carbon market     Linking systems can also be politically symbolic as it shows willingness to undertake a common effort to reduce GHG emissions   Some scholars have argued that linking may provide a starting point for developing a new bottom-up international climate policy architecture whereby multiple unique systems successively link their various systems     In   the U S state of California and the Canadian province of Qu bec successfully linked their systems In   the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba agreed to join the linked system between Quebec and California   On   September   the premiers of Quebec and Ontario and the Governor of California signed the formal agreement establishing the linkage   The International Carbon Action Partnership

social evolution that describe how cultures and societies change over time Whereas sociocultural development traces processes that tend to increase the complexity of a society or culture sociocultural evolution also considers process that can lead to decreases in complexity degeneration or that can produce variation or proliferation without any seemingly significant changes in complexity cladogenesis   Sociocultural evolution is \"the process by which structural reorganization is affected through time eventually producing a form or structure which is qualitatively different from the ancestral form\"   Most 19th-century and some 20th-century approaches to socioculture aimed to provide models for the evolution of humankind as a whole arguing that different societies have reached different stages of social development The most comprehensive attempt to develop a general theory of social evolution centering on the development of sociocultural systems the work of Talcott Parsons     operated on a scale which included a theory of world history Another attempt on a less systematic scale originated with the world-systems approach from the 1970s More recent approaches focus on changes specific to individual societies and reject the idea that cultures differ primarily according to how far each one is on some linear scale of social progress Most modern archaeologists and cultural anthropologists work within the frameworks of neoevolutionism sociobiology and modernization theory Many different societies have existed in the course of human history with estimates as high

References   Bibliography     Readings from an evolutionary anthropological perspective     Introduction edit Anthropologists and sociologists often assume that human beings have natural social tendencies and that particular human social behaviours have non- genetic causes and dynamics i e people learn them in a social environment and through social interaction Societies exist in complex social environments i e with natural resources and constraints and adapt themselves to these environments It is thus inevitable that all societies change Specific theories of social or cultural evolution often attempt to explain differences between coeval societies by positing that different societies have reached different stages of development Although such theories typically provide models for understanding the relationship between technologies social structure or the values of a society they vary as to the extent to which they describe specific mechanisms of variation and change Early sociocultural evolution theories the ideas of Auguste Comte     Herbert Spencer     and Lewis Henry Morgan     developed simultaneously with but independently of Charles Darwin 's works and were popular from the late 19th century to the end of World War I These 19th-century unilineal evolution theories claimed that societies start out in a primitive state and gradually become more civilized over time they equated the culture and technology of Western civilization with progress Some forms of early sociocultural evolution theories mainly unilineal ones have led to much-criticised theories like social Darwinism and scientific racism sometimes used in the past by whom? to justify existing policies of colonialism and slavery and to justify new policies such as eugenics Most 19th-century and some 20th-century approaches aimed to provide models for the evolution of humankind as a single entity However most 20th-century approaches such as multilineal evolution focused on changes specific to individual societies Moreover they rejected directional change i e orthogenetic teleological or progressive change Most archaeologists work within the framework of multilineal evolution Other contemporary approaches to social change include neoevolutionism sociobiology dual inheritance theory modernisation theory and postindustrial theory In his seminal   book The Selfish Gene Richard Dawkins wrote that \"there are some examples of cultural evolution in birds and monkeys but it is our own species that really shows what cultural evolution can do\"   Stadial theory edit Enlightenment and later thinkers often speculated that societies progressed through stages in other words they saw history as stadial While expecting humankind to show increasing development theorists looked for what determined the course of human history Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel     for example saw social development as an inevitable process citation needed It was assumed that societies start out primitive perhaps in a state of nature and could progress toward something resembling industrial Europe While earlier authors such as Michel de Montaigne     had discussed how societies change through time the Scottish Enlightenment of the 18th century proved key in the development of the idea of sociocultural evolution citation needed In relation to Scotland's union with England in   several quantify Scottish thinkers pondered the relationship between progress and the affluence brought about by increased trade with England They understood the changes Scotland was undergoing as involving transition from an agricultural to a mercantile society In \"conjectural histories\" authors such as Adam Ferguson     John Millar     and Adam Smith     argued that societies all pass through a series of four stages hunting and gathering pastoralism and nomadism agriculture and finally a stage of commerce Auguste Comte     Philosophical concepts of progress such as that of Hegel developed as well during this period In France authors such as Claude Adrien Helv tius     and other philosophes were influenced by the Scottish tradition Later thinkers such as Comte de Saint-Simon     developed these ideas citation needed Auguste Comte     in particular presented a coherent view of social progress and a new discipline to study it sociology These developments took place in a context of wider processes The first process was colonialism Although imperial powers settled most differences of opinion with their colonial subjects through force increased awareness of non-Western peoples raised new questions for European scholars about the nature of society and of culture Similarly effective colonial administration required some degree of understanding of other cultures Emerging theories of sociocultural evolution allowed Europeans to organise their new knowledge in a way that reflected and justified their increasing political and economic domination of others such systems saw colonised people as less evolved and colonising people as more evolved Modern civilization understood as the Western civilization appeared the result of steady progress from a state of barbarism and such a notion was common to many thinkers of the Enlightenment including Voltaire     The second process was the Industrial Revolution and the rise of capitalism which together allowed and promoted continual revolutions in the means of production Emerging theories of sociocultural evolution reflected a belief that the changes in Europe brought by the Industrial Revolution and capitalism were improvements Industrialisation combined with the intense political change brought about by the French Revolution of   and the U S Constitution which paved the way for the dominance of democracy forced European thinkers to reconsider some of their assumptions about how society was organised Eventually in the 19th century three major classical theories of social and historical change emerged sociocultural evolutionism the social cycle theory the Marxist theory of historical materialism These theories had a common factor they all agreed that the history of humanity is pursuing a certain fixed path most likely that of social progress Thus each past event is not only chronologically but causally tied to present and future events The theories postulated that by recreating the sequence of those events sociology could discover the \"laws\" of history   Sociocultural evolutionism and the idea of progress edit   Unilineal evolution While sociocultural evolutionists agree that an evolution-like process leads to social progress classical social evolutionists have developed many different theories known as theories of unilineal evolution Sociocultural evolutionism became the prevailing theory of early sociocultural anthropology and social commentary and is associated with scholars like Auguste Comte Edward Burnett Tylor Lewis Henry Morgan Benjamin Kidd L T Hobhouse and Herbert Spencer Sociocultural evolutionism attempted to formalise social thinking along scientific lines with the added influence from the biological theory of evolution If organisms could develop over time according to discernible deterministic laws then it seemed reasonable that societies could as well Human society was compared to a biological organism and social science equivalents of concepts like variation natural selection and inheritance were introduced as factors resulting in the progress of societies The idea of progress led to that of a fixed \"stages\" through which human societies progress usually numbering three savagery barbarism and civilization but sometimes many more As early as the late 18th century the Marquis de Condorcet     listed ten stages or \"epochs\" each advancing the rights of man and perfecting the human race At that time anthropology was rising as a new scientific discipline separating from the traditional views of \"primitive\" cultures that was usually based on religious views citation needed Herbert Spencer Classical social evolutionism is most closely associated with the 19th-century writings of Auguste Comte and of Herbert Spencer coiner of the phrase \" survival of the fittest \"   In many ways Spencer's theory of \" cosmic evolution \" has much more in common with the works of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Auguste Comte than with contemporary works of Charles Darwin Spencer also developed and published his theories several years earlier than Darwin In regard to social institutions however there is a good case that Spencer's writings might be classified as social evolutionism Although he wrote that societies over time progressed and that progress was accomplished through competition he stressed that the individual rather than the collectivity is the unit of analysis that evolves that in other words evolution takes place through natural selection and that it affects social as well as biological phenomenon Nonetheless the publication of Darwin's works which? proved a boon to the proponents of sociocultural evolution who saw the ideas of biological evolution as an attractive explanation for many questions about the development of society Both Spencer and Comte view society as a kind of organism subject to the process of growth from simplicity to complexity from chaos to order from generalisation to specialisation from flexibility to organisation They agree that the process of societal growth can be divided into certain stages have clarification needed their beginning and eventual end and that this growth is in fact social progress each newer more-evolved society is \"better\" Thus progressivism became one of the basic ideas underlying the theory of sociocultural evolutionism   Auguste Comte known as \"the father of sociology\" formulated the law of three stages human development progresses from the theological stage in which nature was mythically conceived and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from supernatural beings through a metaphysical stage in which nature was conceived of as a result of obscure forces and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from them until the final positive stage in which all abstract and obscure forces are discarded and natural phenomena are explained by their constant relationship   This progress is forced through the development of human mind and through increasing application of thought reasoning and logic to the understanding of the world   Comte saw the science-valuing society as the highest most developed type of human organization   Herbert Spencer who argued against government intervention as he believed that society should evolve toward more individual freedom   differentiated between two phases of development as regards societies' internal regulation   the \"military\" and \"industrial\" societies   The earlier and more primitive military society has the goal of conquest and defense is centralised economically self-sufficient collectivistic puts the good of a group over the good of an individual uses compulsion force and repression and rewards loyalty obedience and discipline   The industrial society in contrast has a goal of production and trade is decentralised interconnected with other societies via economic relations works through voluntary cooperation and individual self-restraint treats the good of individual as of the highest value regulates the social life via voluntary relations and values initiative independence and innovation     The transition process from the military to industrial society is the outcome of steady evolutionary processes within the society   Regardless of how scholars of Spencer interpret his relation to Darwin Spencer became an incredibly popular figure in the 1870s particularly in the United States Authors such as Edward L Youmans William Graham Sumner John Fiske John W Burgess Lester Frank Ward Lewis H Morgan     and other thinkers of the gilded age all developed theories of social evolutionism as a result of their exposure to Spencer as well as to Darwin Lewis H Morgan In his   classic Ancient Societies Lewis H Morgan an anthropologist whose ideas have had much impact on sociology differentiated between three eras savagery barbarism and civilization which are divided by technological inventions like fire bow pottery in the savage era domestication of animals agriculture metalworking in the barbarian era and alphabet and writing in the civilization era   Thus Morgan drew a link between social progress and technological progress Morgan viewed technological progress as a force behind social progress and held that any social change in social institutions organizations or ideologies has its beginnings in technological change     Morgan's theories were popularized by Friedrich Engels who based his famous work The Origin of the Family Private Property and the State on them   For Engels and other Marxists this theory was important as it supported their conviction that materialistic factors economic and technological are decisive in shaping the fate of humanity   Edward Burnett Tylor     a pioneer of anthropology focused on the evolution of culture worldwide noting that culture is an important part of every society and that it is also subject to a process of evolution He believed that societies were at different stages of cultural development and that the purpose of anthropology was to reconstruct the evolution of culture from primitive beginnings to the modern state Edward Burnett Tylor Anthropologists Sir E B Tylor in England and Lewis Henry Morgan in the United States worked with data from indigenous people who they claimed represented earlier stages of cultural evolution that gave insight into the process and progression of evolution of culture Morgan would later when? have a significant influence on Karl Marx and on Friedrich Engels who developed a theory of sociocultural evolution in which the internal contradictions in society generated a series of escalating stages that ended in a socialist society see Marxism Tylor and Morgan elaborated the theory of unilinear evolution specifying criteria for categorising cultures according to their standing within a fixed system of growth of humanity as a whole and examining the modes and mechanisms of this growth Theirs was often a concern with culture in general not with individual cultures Their analysis of cross-cultural data was based on three assumptions contemporary societies may be classified and ranked as more \"primitive\" or more \"civilized\" there are a determinate number of stages between \"primitive\" and \"civilized\" e g band tribe chiefdom and state all societies progress through these stages in the same sequence but at different rates Theorists usually measured progression that is the difference between one stage and the next in terms of increasing social complexity including class differentiation and a complex division of labour or an increase in intellectual theological and aesthetic sophistication These 19th-century ethnologists used these principles primarily to explain differences in religious beliefs and kinship terminologies among various societies Lester Frank Ward Lester Frank Ward     sometimes referred to by whom? as the \"father\" of American sociology rejected many of Spencer's theories regarding the evolution of societies Ward who was also a botanist and a paleontologist believed that the law of evolution functioned much differently in human societies than it did in the plant and animal kingdoms and theorized that the \"law of nature\" had been superseded by the \"law of the mind\"   He stressed that humans driven by emotions create goals for themselves and strive to realize them most effectively with the modern scientific method whereas there is no such intelligence and awareness guiding the non-human world   Plants and animals adapt to nature man shapes nature While Spencer believed that competition and \"survival of the fittest\" benefited human society and sociocultural evolution Ward regarded competition as a destructive force pointing out that all human institutions traditions and laws were tools invented by the mind of man and that that mind designed them like all tools to \"meet and checkmate\" the unrestrained competition of natural forces   Ward agreed with Spencer that authoritarian governments repress the talents of the individual but he believed that modern democratic societies which minimized the role of religion and maximized that of science could effectively support the individual in his or her attempt to fully utilize their talents and achieve happiness He believed that the evolutionary processes have four stages First comes cosmogenesis creation and evolution of the world Then when life arises there is biogenesis   Development of humanity leads to anthropogenesis which is influenced by the human mind   Finally there arrives sociogenesis which is the science of shaping the evolutionary process itself to optimize progress human happiness and individual self-actualization   While Ward regarded modern societies as superior to \"primitive\" societies one need only look to the impact of medical science on health and lifespan citation needed he rejected theories of white supremacy he supported the Out-of-Africa theory of human evolution and believed that all races and social classes were equal in talent   However Ward did not think that evolutionary progress was inevitable and he feared the degeneration of societies and cultures which he saw as very evident in the historical record   Ward also did not favor the radical reshaping of society as proposed by the supporters of the eugenics movement or by the followers of Karl Marx like Comte Ward believed that sociology was the most complex of the sciences and that true sociogenesis was impossible without considerable research and experimentation   mile Durkheim mile Durkheim another of the \"fathers\" of sociology developed a dichotomal view of social progress   His key concept was social solidarity as he defined social evolution in terms of progressing from mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity   In mechanical solidarity people are self-sufficient there is little integration and thus there is the need for the use of force and repression to keep society together   In organic solidarity people are much more integrated and interdependent and specialisation and cooperation are extensive   Progress from mechanical to organic solidarity is based firstly on population growth and increasing population density secondly on increasing \"morality density\" development of more complex social interactions and thirdly on increasing specialisation in the workplace   To Durkheim the most important factor in social progress is the division of labour   This clarification needed was later used in the mid-1900s by the economist Ester Boserup     to attempt to discount some aspects of Malthusian theory Ferdinand T nnies     describes evolution as the development from informal society where people have many liberties and there are few laws and obligations to modern formal rational society dominated by traditions and laws where people are restricted from acting as they wish   He also notes that there is a tendency to standardisation and unification when all smaller societies are absorbed into a single large modern society   Thus T nnies can be said to describe part of the process known today as globalization T nnies was also one of the first sociologists to claim that the evolution of society is not necessarily going in the right direction that social progress is not perfect and it can even be called a regression as the newer more evolved societies are obtained only after paying a high cost resulting in decreasing satisfaction of the individuals making up that society   T nnies' work became the foundation of neoevolutionism   Although Max Weber is not usually counted by whom? as a sociocultural evolutionist his theory of tripartite classification of authority can be viewed by whom? as an evolutionary theory as well Weber distinguishes three ideal types of political leadership domination and authority charismatic domination traditional domination patriarchs patrimonalism feudalism legal rational domination modern law and state bureaucracy Weber also notes that legal domination is the most advanced and that societies evolve from having mostly traditional and charismatic authorities to mostly rational and legal ones Critique and impact on modern theories edit The early 20th-century inaugurated a period of systematic critical examination and rejection of the sweeping generalisations of the unilineal theories of sociocultural evolution Cultural anthropologists such as Franz Boas     along with his students including Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead are regarded by whom? as the leaders of anthropology's rejection of classical social evolutionism They used sophisticated ethnography and more rigorous empirical methods to argue that Spencer Tylor and Morgan's theories were speculative and systematically misrepresented ethnographic data Theories regarding \"stages\" of evolution were especially criticised as illusions Additionally they rejected the distinction between \"primitive\" and \"civilized\" or \"modern\" pointing out that so-called primitive contemporary societies have just as much history and were just as evolved as so-called civilized societies They therefore argued that any attempt to use this theory to reconstruct the histories of non-literate i e leaving no historical documents peoples is entirely speculative and unscientific They observed that the postulated progression which typically ended with a stage of civilization identical to that of modern Europe is ethnocentric They also pointed out that the theory assumes that societies are clearly bounded and distinct when in fact cultural traits and forms often cross social boundaries and diffuse among many different societies and are thus an important mechanism of change Boas in his culture-history approach focused on anthropological fieldwork in an attempt to identify factual processes instead of what he criticized as speculative stages of growth His approach greatly influenced American anthropology in the first half of the 20th century and marked a retreat from high-level generalization and from \"systems building\" Later critics observed that the assumption of firmly bounded societies was proposed precisely at the time when European powers were colonising non-Western societies and was thus self-serving Many anthropologists and social theorists now consider unilineal cultural and social evolution a Western myth seldom based on solid empirical grounds Critical theorists argue that notions of social evolution are simply justifications for power by the lites of society Finally the devastating World Wars that occurred between   and   crippled Europe's self-confidence After millions of deaths genocide and the destruction of Europe's industrial infrastructure the idea of progress seemed dubious at best Thus modern sociocultural evolutionism rejects most of classical social evolutionism due to various theoretical problems The theory was deeply ethnocentric it makes heavy value judgments about different societies with Western civilization seen as the most valuable It assumed all cultures follow the same path or progression and have the same goals It equated civilization with material culture technology cities etc Because social evolution was posited as a scientific theory it was often used to support unjust and often racist social practices particularly colonialism slavery and the unequal economic conditions present within industrialized Europe Social Darwinism is especially criticised as it purportedly led to some philosophies used by the Nazis Max Weber disenchantment and critical theory edit Max Weber in   Main articles Max Weber and Critical theory Weber's major works in economic sociology and the sociology of religion dealt with the rationalization secularisation and so called \" disenchantment \" which he associated with the rise of capitalism and modernity   In sociology rationalization is the process whereby an increasing number of social actions become based on considerations of teleological efficiency or calculation rather than on motivations derived from morality emotion custom or tradition Rather than referring to what is genuinely \"rational\" or \"logical\" rationalization refers to a relentless quest for goals that might actually function to the detriment of a society Rationalization is an ambivalent aspect of modernity manifested especially in Western society - as a behaviour of the capitalist market of rational administration in the state and bureaucracy of the extension of modern science and of the expansion of modern technology citation needed Weber's thought regarding the rationalizing and secularizing tendencies of modern Western society sometimes described as the \" Weber Thesis \" would blend with Marxism to facilitate critical theory particularly in the work of thinkers such as J rgen Habermas born   Critical theorists as antipositivists are critical of the idea of a hierarchy of sciences or societies particularly with respect to the sociological positivism originally set forth by Comte J rgen Habermas has critiqued the concept of pure instrumental rationality as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to ideology itself For theorists such as Zygmunt Bauman 1925-2017 rationalization as a manifestation of modernity may be most closely and regrettably associated with the events of the Holocaust Modern theories edit   multilineal evolution Composite image of the Earth at night created by NASA and NOAA The brightest areas of the Earth are the most urbanized but not necessarily the most populated Even more than   years after the invention of the electric light most regions remain thinly populated or unlit When the critique of classical social evolutionism became widely accepted modern anthropological and sociological approaches changed respectively Modern theories are careful to avoid unsourced ethnocentric speculation comparisons or value judgments more or less regarding individual societies as existing within their own historical contexts These conditions provided the context for new theories such as cultural relativism and multilineal evolution In the 1920s and 1930s Gordon Childe revolutionized the study of cultural evolutionism He conducted a comprehensive pre-history account that provided scholars with evidence for African and Asian cultural transmission into Europe He combated scientific racism by finding the tools and artifacts of the indigenous people from Africa and Asia and showed how they influenced the technology of European culture Evidence from his excavations countered the idea of Aryan supremacy and superiority Childe explained cultural evolution by his theory of divergence with modifications of convergence He postulated that different cultures form separate methods that meet different needs but when two cultures were in contact they developed similar adaptations solving similar problems Rejecting Spencer s theory of parallel cultural evolution Childe found that interactions between cultures contributed to the convergence of similar aspects most often attributed to one culture Childe placed emphasis on human culture as a social construct rather than products of environmental or technological contexts Childe coined the terms \" Neolithic Revolution \" and \" Urban Revolution \" which are still used today in the branch of pre-historic anthropology In   anthropologist Robert Redfield wrote about a shift from folk society to urban society By the 1940s cultural anthropologists such as Leslie White and Julian Steward sought to revive an evolutionary model on a more scientific basis and succeeded in establishing an approach known as neoevolutionism White rejected the opposition between \"primitive\" and \"modern\" societies but did argue that societies could be distinguished based on the amount of energy they harnessed and that increased energy allowed for greater social differentiation White s law Steward on the other hand rejected the 19th-century notion of progress and instead called attention to the Darwinian notion of \"adaptation\" arguing that all societies had to adapt to their environment in some way The anthropologists Marshall Sahlins and Elman Service prepared an edited volume Evolution and Culture in which they attempted to synthesise White s and Steward s approaches   Other anthropologists building on or responding to work by White and Steward developed theories of cultural ecology and ecological anthropology The most prominent examples are Peter Vayda and Roy Rappaport By the late 1950s students of Steward such as Eric Wolf and Sidney Mintz turned away from cultural ecology to Marxism World Systems Theory Dependency theory and Marvin Harris s Cultural materialism Today most anthropologists reject 19th-century notions of progress and the three assumptions of unilineal evolution Following Steward they take seriously the relationship between a culture and its environment to explain different aspects of a culture But most modern cultural anthropologists have adopted a general systems approach examining cultures as emergent systems and arguing that one must consider the whole social environment which includes political and economic relations among cultures As a result of simplistic notions of \"progressive evolution\" more modern complex cultural evolution theories such as Dual Inheritance Theory discussed below receive little attention in the social sciences having given way in some cases to a series of more humanist approaches Some reject the entirety of evolutionary thinking and look instead at historical contingencies contacts with other cultures and the operation of cultural symbol systems In the area of development studies authors such as Amartya Sen have developed an understanding of development and human flourishing that also question more simplistic notions of progress while retaining much of their original inspiration Neoevolutionism edit   Neoevolutionism Neoevolutionism was the first in a series of modern multilineal evolution theories It emerged in the 1930s and extensively developed in the period following the Second World War and was incorporated into both anthropology and sociology in the 1960s It bases its theories on empirical evidence from areas of archaeology palaeontology and historiography and tries to eliminate any references to systems of values be it moral or cultural instead trying to remain objective and simply descriptive   While 19th-century evolutionism explained how culture develops by giving general principles of its evolutionary process it was dismissed by the Historical Particularists as unscientific in the early 20th century It was the neo-evolutionary thinkers who brought back evolutionary thought and developed it to be acceptable to contemporary anthropology Neo-evolutionism discards many ideas of classical social evolutionism namely that of social progress so dominant in previous sociology evolution-related theories   Then neo-evolutionism discards the determinism argument and introduces probability arguing that accidents and free will greatly affect the process of social evolution   It also supports counterfactual history asking \"what if\" and considering different possible paths that social evolution may take or might have taken and thus allows for the fact that various cultures may develop in different ways some skipping entire stages others have passed through   Neo-evolutionism stresses the importance of empirical evidence While 19th-century evolutionism used value judgments and assumptions for interpreting data neo-evolutionism relies on measurable information for analysing the process of sociocultural evolution Leslie White author of The Evolution of Culture The Development of Civilization to the Fall of Rome   attempted to create a theory explaining the entire history of humanity   The most important factor in his theory is technology   Social systems are determined by technological systems wrote White in his book   echoing the earlier theory of Lewis Henry Morgan He proposes a society s energy consumption as a measure of its advancement   He differentiates between five stages of human development   In the first people use the energy of their own muscles   In the second they use the energy of domesticated animals   In the third they use the energy of plants so White refers to agricultural revolution here   In the fourth they learn to use the energy of natural resources coal oil gas   In the fifth they harness nuclear energy   White introduced a formula P=E*T where E is a measure of energy consumed and T is the measure of efficiency of technical factors utilising the energy   This theory is similar to Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev s later theory of the Kardashev scale Julian Steward author of Theory of Culture Change The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution   reprinted   created the theory of \"multilinear\" evolution which examined the way in which societies adapted to their environment This approach was more nuanced than White s theory of \"unilinear evolution \" Steward rejected the 19th-century notion of progress and instead called attention to the Darwinian notion of \"adaptation\" arguing that all societies had to adapt to their environment in some way He argued that different adaptations could be studied through the examination of the specific resources a society exploited the technology the society relied on to exploit these resources and the organization of human labour He further argued that different environments and technologies would require different kinds of adaptations and that as the resource base or technology changed so too would a culture In other words cultures do not change according to some inner logic but rather in terms of a changing relationship with a changing environment Cultures therefore would not pass through the same stages in the same order as they changed rather they would change in varying ways and directions He called his theory \"multilineal evolution\" He questioned the possibility of creating a social theory encompassing the entire evolution of humanity however he argued that anthropologists are not limited to describing specific existing cultures He believed that it is possible to create theories analysing typical common culture representative of specific eras or regions As the decisive factors determining the development of given culture he pointed to technology and economics but noted that there are secondary factors like political system ideologies and religion All those factors push the evolution of a given society in several directions at the same time hence the application of the term \"multilinear\" to his theory of evolution Marshall Sahlins co-editor with Elman Service of Evolution and Culture   divided the evolution of societies into general and specific   General evolution is the tendency of cultural and social systems to increase in complexity organization and adaptiveness to environment   However as the various cultures are not isolated there is interaction and a diffusion of their qualities like technological inventions   This leads cultures to develop in different ways specific evolution as various elements are introduced to them in different combinations and at different stages of evolution   In his Power and Prestige   and Human Societies An Introduction to Macrosociology   Gerhard Lenski expands on the works of Leslie White and Lewis Henry Morgan   developing the ecological-evolutionary theory He views technological progress as the most basic factor in the evolution of societies and cultures   Unlike White who defined technology as the ability to create and utilise energy Lenski focuses on information its amount and uses   The more information and knowledge especially allowing the shaping of natural environment a given society has the more advanced it is   He distinguishes four stages of human development based on advances in the history of communication   In the first stage information is passed by genes   In the second when humans gain sentience they can learn and pass information through by experience   In the third humans start using signs and develop logic   In the fourth they can create symbols and develop language and writing   Advancements in the technology of communication translate into advancements in the economic system and political system distribution of goods social inequality and other spheres of social life He also differentiates societies based on their level of technology communication and economy   hunters and gatherers   agricultural   industrial and   special like fishing societies   Talcott Parsons author of Societies Evolutionary and Comparative Perspectives   and The System of Modern Societies   divided evolution into four subprocesses   division which creates functional subsystems from the main system   adaptation where those systems evolve into more efficient versions   inclusion of elements previously excluded from the given systems and   generalization of values increasing the legitimization of the ever more complex system   He shows those processes on   stages of evolution I primitive or foraging II archaic agricultural III classical or \"historic\" in his terminology using formalized and universalizing theories about reality and IV modern empirical cultures However these divisions in Parsons theory are the more formal ways in which the evolutionary process is conceptualized and should not be mistaken for Parsons actual theory Parsons develops a theory where he tries to reveal the complexity of the processes which take form between two points of necessity the first being the cultural \"necessity \" which is given through the values-system of each evolving community the other is the environmental necessities which most directly is reflected in the material realities of the basic production system and in the relative capacity of each industrial-economical level at each window of time Generally Parsons highlights that the dynamics and directions of these processes is shaped by the cultural imperative embodied in the cultural heritage and more secondarily an outcome of sheer \"economic\" conditions Michel Foucault s recent and very much misunderstood concepts such as Biopower Biopolitics and Power-knowledge has been cited as breaking free from the traditional conception of man as cultural animal Foucault regards both the terms cultural animal and \"human nature\"as misleading abstractions leading to a non critical exemption of man and anything can be justified when regarding social processes or natural phenomena social phenomena   Foucault argues these complex processes are interrelated and difficult to study for a reason so those 'truths' cannot be topled or disrupted For Foucault the many modern concepts and practices that attempt to uncover the truth about human beings either psychologically sexually religion or spiritually actually create the very types of people they purport to discover Requiring trained \"specialists\" and knowledge codes and know how rigorous pursuit is \"put off\" or delayed which makes any kind of study not only a taboo subject but deliberately ignored He cites the concept of truth   within many human cultures and the ever flowing dynamics between truth power and knowledge as a resultant complex dynamics Foucault uses the term regimes of truth and how they flow with ease like water which make the concept of truth impervious to any further rational investigation Some of the West s most powerful social institutions are powerful for a reason not because they exhibit powerful structures which inhibit investigation or it is illegal to investigate there historical foundation It is the very notion of \"legitimacy\" Foucault cites as examples of \"truth\" which function as a \" Foundationalism \" claims to historical accuracy Foucault argues systems such as Medicine Prisons     and Religion as well as groundbreaking works on more abstract theoretical issues of power are suspended or buried into oblivion   He cites as further examples the Scientific study of Population biology and Population genetics   as both examples of this kind of Biopower over the vast majority of the human population giving the new founded political population their politics or polity With the advent of biology and genetics teamed together as new scientific innovations notions of study of knowledge regarding truth belong to the realm of experts who will never divulge their secrets openly while the bulk of the population do not know their own biology or genetics this is done for them by the experts This functions as a truth ignorance mechanism where the subjugated knowledge s as those that have been both written out of history and submerged in it in a masked form produces what we now know as truth He calls them Knowledge s from below and a historical knowledge of struggles Genealogy Foucault suggests is a way of getting at these knowledge s and struggles they are about the insurrection of knowledge s Foucault tries to show with the added dimension of Milieu derived from Newtonian mechanics how this Milieu from the 17th century with the development of the Biological and Physical sciences managed to be interwoven into the political social and biological relationship of men with the arrival of the concept Work placed upon the industrial population   Foucault uses the term borrowed from Jakob von Uexk ll Umwelt meaning environment within Technology production Cartography the production of Nation states and Government making the efficiency of the Body politic Law Heredity and Consanguine   not only sound genuine and beyond historical origin and foundation it can be turned into exact truth where the individual and the societal body are not only subjugated and nullified but dependent upon it Foucault is not denying that genetic or biological study is inaccurate or is simply not telling the truth what he means is that notions of this newly discovered sciences were extended to include the vast majority or whole populations of populations as an exercise in regimes change Foucault argues that the conceptual meaning from the Middle ages and Canon law period the Geocentric model later superseded by the Heliocentrism model placing the position of the law of right in the Middle ages Exclusive right or its correct legal term Sui generis was the Divine right of kings and Absolute monarchy where the previous incarnation of truth and rule of political sovereignty was considered absolute and unquestioned by Political Philosophy monarchs popes and emperors However Foucault notices that this Pharaonic version of Political power was transversed and it was with 18th-century emergence of Capitalism and Liberal democracy that these terms began to be democratized The modern Pharaonic version represented by the President the monarch the Pope and the Prime minister all became propagandized versions or examples of symbol agents all aimed at towards a newly discovered phenomenon the population     As symbolic symbol agents of power making the mass population having to sacrifice itself all in the name of the newly formed voting franchise we now call Democracy However this was all turned on its head when the Medieval rulers were thrown out and replaced by a more exact apparatus now called the state when the human sciences suddenly discovered The set of mechanisms through which the basic biological features of the human species became an object of a political strategy and took on board the fundamental facts that humans were now a biological species \"     Sociobiology edit   Sociobiology Sociobiology departs perhaps the furthest from classical social evolutionism   It was introduced by Edward Wilson in his   book Sociobiology The New Synthesis and followed his adaptation of evolutionary theory to the field of social sciences Wilson pioneered the attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviours such as altruism aggression and nurturance   In doing so Wilson sparked one of the greatest scientific controversies of the 20th century   The current theory of evolution the modern evolutionary synthesis or neo-darwinism explains that evolution of species occurs through a combination of Darwin s mechanism of natural selection and Gregor Mendel s theory of genetics as the basis for biological inheritance and mathematical population genetics   Essentially the modern synthesis introduced the connection between two important discoveries the units of evolution genes with the main mechanism of evolution selection   Due to its close reliance on biology sociobiology is often considered a branch of the biology although it uses techniques from a plethora of sciences including ethology evolution zoology archaeology population genetics and many others Within the study of human societies sociobiology is closely related to the fields of human behavioral ecology and evolutionary psychology Sociobiology has remained highly controversial as it contends genes explain specific human behaviours although sociobiologists describe this role as a very complex and often unpredictable interaction between nature and nurture The most notable critics of the view that genes play a direct role in human behaviour have been biologists Richard Lewontin Steven Rose and Stephen Jay Gould Since the rise of evolutionary psychology another school of thought Dual Inheritance Theory has emerged in the past   years that applies the mathematical standards of Population genetics to modeling the adaptive and selective principles of culture This school of thought was pioneered by Robert Boyd at UCLA and Peter Richerson at UC Davis and expanded by William Wimsatt among others Boyd and Richerson s book Culture and the Evolutionary Process     was a highly mathematical description of cultural change later published in a more accessible form in Not by Genes Alone     In Boyd and Richerson s view cultural evolution operating on socially learned information exists on a separate but co-evolutionary track from genetic evolution and while the two are related cultural evolution is more dynamic rapid and influential on human society than genetic evolution Dual Inheritance Theory has the benefit of providing unifying territory for a \"nature and nurture\" paradigm and accounts for more accurate phenomenon in evolutionary theory applied to culture such as randomness effects drift concentration dependency \"fidelity\" of evolving information systems and lateral transmission through communication   Theory of modernization edit   Modernization theory Theories of modernization have been developed and popularized in 1950s and 1960s and are closely related to the dependency theory and development theory   They combine the previous theories of sociocultural evolution with practical experiences and empirical research especially those from the era of decolonization The theory states that Western countries are the most developed and the rest of the world mostly former colonies is in the earlier stages of development and will eventually reach the same level as the Western world   Development stages go from the traditional societies to developed ones   Third World countries have fallen behind with their social progress and need to be directed on their way to becoming more advanced   Developing from classical social evolutionism theories the theory of modernization stresses the modernization factor many societies are simply trying or need to emulate the most successful societies and cultures   It also states that it is possible to do so thus supporting the concepts of social engineering and that the developed countries can and should help those less developed directly or indirectly   Among the scientists who contributed much to this theory are Walt Rostow who in his The Stages of Economic Growth A Non-Communist Manifesto   concentrates on the economic system side of the modernization trying to show factors needed for a country to reach the path to modernization in his Rostovian take-off model   David Apter concentrated on the political system and history of democracy researching the connection between democracy good governance and efficiency and modernization   David McClelland The Achieving Society   approached this subject from the psychological perspective with his motivations theory arguing that modernization cannot happen until given society values innovation success and free enterprise   Alex Inkeles Becoming Modern   similarly creates a model of modern personality which needs to be independent active interested in public policies and cultural matters open to new experiences rational and able to create long-term plans for the future   Some works of J rgen Habermas are also connected with this subfield The theory of modernization has been subject to some criticism similar to that levied against classical social evolutionism especially for being too ethnocentric one-sided and focused on the Western world and its culture Prediction for a stable cultural and social future edit Cultural evolution follows punctuated equilibrium which Gould and Eldredge developed for biological evolution Bloomfield     has written that human societies follow punctuated equilibrium which would mean first a stable society and then a transition resulting in a subsequent stable society with greater complexity This model would claim mankind has had a stable animal society a transition to a stable tribal society another transition to a stable peasant society and is currently in a transitional industrial society The status of a human society rests on the productivity of food production Deevey   reported on the growth of the number of humans Deevey also reported on the productivity of food production noting that productivity changes very little for stable societies but increases during transitions When productivity and especially food productivity can no longer be increased Bloomfield has proposed that man will have achieved a stable automated society   Space is also assumed to allow for the continued growth of the human population as well as providing a solution to the current pollution problem by providing limitless energy from solar satellite power stations Contemporary perspectives edit Political perspectives edit The Cold War period was marked by rivalry between two superpowers both of which considered themselves to be the most highly evolved cultures on the planet The USSR painted itself as a socialist society which emerged from class struggle destined to reach the state of communism while sociologists in the United States such as Talcott Parsons argued that the freedom and prosperity of the United States were a proof of a higher level of sociocultural evolution of its culture and society At the same time decolonization created newly independent countries who sought to become more developed a model of progress and industrialization which was itself a form of sociocultural evolution There is however a tradition in European social theory from Rousseau to Max Weber arguing that this progression coincides with a loss of human freedom and dignity At the height of the Cold War this tradition merged with an interest in ecology to influence an activist culture in the 1960s This movement produced a variety of political and philosophical programs which emphasized the importance of bringing society and the environment into harmony Technological perspectives edit Schematic Timeline of Information and Replicators in the Biosphere major evolutionary transitions in information processing   Many who? argue that the next stage of sociocultural evolution consists of a merger with technology especially information processing technology Several cumulative major transitions of evolution have transformed life through key innovations in information storage and replication including RNA DNA multicellularity and also language and culture as inter-human information processing systems     in this sense it can be argued that the carbon-based biosphere has generated a cognitive system humans capable of creating technology that will result in a comparable evolutionary transition \"Digital information has reached a similar magnitude to information in the biosphere It increases exponentially exhibits high-fidelity replication evolves through differential fitness is expressed through artificial intelligence AI and has facility for virtually limitless recombination Like previous evolutionary transitions the potential symbiosis between biological and digital information will reach a critical point where these codes could compete via natural selection Alternatively this fusion could create a higher-level superorganism employing a low-conflict division of labor in performing informational tasks humans already embrace fusions of biology and technology We spend most of our waking time communicating through digitally mediated channels most transactions on the stock market are executed by automated trading algorithms and our electric grids are in the hands of artificial intelligence With one in three marriages in America beginning online digital algorithms are also taking a role in human pair bonding and reproduction\"   Anthropological perspectives edit Current political theories of the new tribalists consciously mimic ecology and the life-ways of indigenous peoples augmenting them with modern sciences Ecoregional Democracy attempts to confine the \"shifting groups\" or tribes within \"more or less clear boundaries\" that a society inherits from the surrounding ecology to the borders of a naturally occurring ecoregion Progress can proceed by competition between but not within tribes and it is limited by ecological borders or by Natural Capitalism incentives which attempt to mimic the pressure of natural selection on a human society by forcing it to adapt consciously to scarce energy or materials Gaians argue that societies evolve deterministically to play a role in the ecology of their biosphere or else die off as failures due to competition from more efficient societies exploiting nature's leverage Thus some have appealed to theories of sociocultural evolution to assert that optimizing the ecology and the social harmony of closely knit groups is more desirable or necessary than the progression to \"civilization \" A   poll of experts on Neoarctic and Neotropic indigenous peoples reported in Harper's magazine citation needed revealed that all of them would have preferred to be a typical New World person in the year   prior to any European contact rather than a typical European of that time This approach has been criticised by pointing out that there are a number of historical examples of indigenous peoples doing severe environmental damage such as the deforestation of Easter Island and the extinction of mammoths in North America and that proponents of the goal

search Play media The carbon footprint explained A carbon footprint is historically defined as the total emissions caused by an individual event organisation or product expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent   In most cases the total carbon footprint cannot be exactly calculated because of inadequate knowledge of and data about the complex interactions between contributing processes especially which including the influence on natural processes storing or releasing carbon dioxide For this reason Wright Kemp and Williams have suggested to define the carbon footprint as A measure of the total amount of carbon dioxide CO   and methane CH   emissions of a defined population system or activity considering all relevant sources sinks and storage within the spatial and temporal boundary of the population system or activity of interest Calculated as carbon dioxide equivalent using the relevant 100-year global warming potential GWP100   Greenhouse gases GHGs can be emitted through land clearance and the production and consumption of food fuels manufactured goods materials wood roads buildings transportation and other services   For simplicity of reporting it is often expressed in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide or its equivalent of other GHGs emitted Most of the carbon footprint emissions for the average U S household come from \"indirect\" sources i e fuel burned to produce goods far away from the final consumer These are distinguished from emissions which come from burning fuel directly in one's car or stove commonly referred to as \"direct\" sources of the consumer's carbon footprint   The concept name of the carbon footprint originates from ecological footprint discussion   which was developed by Rees and Wackernagel in the 1990s which estimates the number of \"earths\" that would theoretically be required if everyone on the planet consumed resources at the same level as the person calculating their ecological footprint However given that ecological footprints are a measure of failure Anindita Mitra CREA Seattle chose the more easily calculated \"carbon footprint\" to easily measure use of carbon as an indicator of unsustainable energy use In   carbon footprint was used as a measure of carbon emissions to develop the energy plan for City of Lynnwood Washington Carbon footprints are much more specific than ecological footprints since

to these questions A systematic literature review was conducted to objectively determine the best way to calculate individual/household carbon footprints This review identified   calculation principles and subsequently used the same principles to evaluate the   most popular online carbon footprint calculators A recent study s results by Carnegie Mellon's Christopher Weber found that the calculation of carbon footprints for products is often filled with large uncertainties The variables of owning electronic goods such as the production shipment and previous technology used to make that product can make it difficult to create an accurate carbon footprint It is important to question and address the accuracy of Carbon Footprint techniques especially due to its overwhelming popularity   Carbon Footprints can be reduced through the development of alternative projects such as solar and wind energy which are environment friendly renewable resources or reforestation the restocking of existing forests or woodlands that have previously been depleted These examples are known as Carbon Offsetting the counteracting of carbon dioxide emissions with an equivalent reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere   The main influences on carbon footprints include population economic output and energy and carbon intensity of the economy   These factors are the main targets of individuals and businesses in order to decrease carbon footprints Production creates a large carbon footprint scholars suggest that decreasing the amount of energy needed for production would be one of the most effective ways to decrease a carbon footprint This is due to the fact that Electricity is responsible for roughly 37% of Carbon Dioxide emissions   Coal production has been refined to greatly reduce carbon emissions since the 1980s the amount of energy used to produce a ton of steel has decreased by 50%   Average carbon footprint per person by country edit The global average carbon footprint in   was around     tons CO   e/cap The EU average for this time was about     tons CO   e/cap whereas for the U S Luxembourg and Australia it was over   tons CO   e/cap The footprints per capita of countries in Africa and India were well below average To set this numbers into context assuming a global population around 9-10 billion by   a carbon footprint of about   -     tons CO   e per capita is needed to stay within a   C target The carbon footprint calculations are based on a consumption based approach using a Multi-Regional Input-Output database which accounts for all Greenhouse Gas GHG emissions in the global supply chain and allocates them to the final consumer of the purchased commodities GHG emissions related to land use cover change are not included   Mobility

the carbon footprint of mobility is evenly split between direct emissions e g from driving private cars and emissions embodied in purchased products related to mobility air transport service emissions occurring during the production of cars and during the extraction of fuel   The carbon footprint of U S households is about   times greater than the global average For most U S households the single most important action to reduce their carbon footprint is driving less or switching to a more efficient vehicle   Direct carbon emissions edit The carbon footprint of energy edit   Life-cycle

equally significant and research shows that using waste heat from power generation in combined heat and power district heating chp/dh has the lowest carbon footprint   much lower than micro-power or heat pumps Passenger transport edit Average carbon dioxide emissions grams per passenger mile USA Based on 'Updated Comparison of Energy Use & CO   Emissions From Different Transportation Modes October 2008' Manchester NH M J Bradley & Associates   p   table       This section gives representative figures for the carbon footprint of the fuel burned by different transport types not including the carbon footprints of the vehicles or related infrastructure themselves The precise figures vary according to a wide range of factors Flight edit   Environmental impact of aviation Some representative figures for CO   emissions are provided by LIPASTO's survey of average direct emissions not accounting for high-altitude radiative effects of airliners expressed as CO   and CO   equivalent per passenger kilometre   Domestic short distance less than   km   mi   g/km CO   or   g/km     oz/mile CO   e Long distance flights   g/km CO   or   g/km     oz/mile CO   e However emissions per unit distance traveled is not necessarily the best indicator for the carbon footprint of air travel because the distances covered are commonly longer than by other modes of travel It is the total emissions for a trip that matters for a carbon footprint not the merely rate of emissions For example a greatly more distant holiday destination may be chosen than if another mode of travel were used because air travel makes the longer distance feasible in the limited time available   Road edit CO   emissions per passenger kilometre pkm for all road travel for   in Europe as provided by

much more of the system is electrified   and about eight times a Finnish electric intercity train   Sea edit Average carbon dioxide emissions by ferries per passenger-kilometre seem to be     kg     oz   However 18- knot ferries between Finland and Sweden produce     kg     oz of CO   with total emissions equalling a CO   equivalent of     kg     oz while   27-knot ferries between Finland and Estonia produce     kg     oz of CO   with total emissions equalling a CO   equivalent of     kg   oz   Indirect carbon emissions the carbon footprints of products edit Several organizations offer footprint calculators for public and corporate use   and several organizations have calculated carbon footprints of products   The US Environmental Protection Agency has addressed paper plastic candy wrappers glass cans computers carpet and tires Australia has addressed lumber and other building materials Academics in Australia Korea and the US have addressed paved roads Companies nonprofits and academics have addressed mailing letters and packages Carnegie Mellon University has estimated the CO   footprints of   large sectors of the economy in each of eight countries Carnegie Mellon Sweden and the Carbon Trust have addressed foods at home and in restaurants The Carbon Trust has worked with UK manufacturers on foods shirts and detergents introducing a CO   label in March   The label is intended to comply with a new British Publicly Available Specification i e not a standard PAS     and is being actively piloted by The Carbon Trust and various industrial partners   As of August   The Carbon Trust state they have measured     certifiable product carbon footprints   Evaluating the package of some products is key to figuring out the carbon footprint   The key way to determine a carbon footprint is to look at the materials used to make the item For example a juice carton is made of an aseptic carton a beer can is made of aluminum and some water bottles either made of glass or plastic The larger the size the larger the footprint will be Food edit   Low carbon diet In a   study by Scarborough et al the real-life diets of British people were surveyed and their dietary greenhouse gas footprints estimated   Average dietary greenhouse-gas emissions per day in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent were     for high meat-eaters     for medium meat-eaters     for low meat-eaters     for fish-eaters     for vegetarians     for vegans Textiles edit The precise carbon footprint of different textiles varies considerably according to a wide range of factors However studies of textile production in Europe suggest the following carbon dioxide equivalent emissions footprints per kilo of textile at the point of purchase by a consumer   Cotton   Nylon     PET e g synthetic fleece     Wool     Accounting for durability and energy required to wash and dry textile products synthetic fabrics generally have a substantially lower carbon footprint than natural ones   Materials edit The carbon footprint of materials also known as embodied carbon varies widely The carbon footprint of many common materials can be found in the Inventory of Carbon & Energy database   the GREET databases and models   and LCA databases via openLCA Nexus   Cement edit Cement production and carbon footprint resulting from soil sealing was     Mg person   of total per capita CO   emissions Italy year   the balance between C loss due to soil sealing and C stocked in man-made infrastructures resulted in a net loss to the atmosphere -0   Mg C ha   y     Schemes to reduce carbon emissions Kyoto Protocol carbon offsetting and certificates edit Carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and the emissions of other GHGs are often associated with the burning of fossil fuels like natural gas crude oil and coal While this is harmful to the environment carbon offsets can be purchased in an attempt to make up for these harmful effects The Kyoto Protocol defines legally binding targets and timetables for cutting the GHG emissions of industrialized countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol Accordingly from an economic or market perspective one has to distinguish between a mandatory market and a voluntary market Typical for both markets is the trade with emission certificates Certified Emission Reduction CER Emission Reduction Unit ERU Verified Emission Reduction VER Mandatory market mechanisms edit To reach the goals defined in the Kyoto Protocol with the least economical costs the following flexible mechanisms were introduced for the mandatory market Clean Development Mechanism CDM Joint Implementation JI Emissions trading The CDM and JI mechanisms requirements for projects which create a supply of emission reduction instruments while Emissions Trading allows those instruments to be sold on international markets - Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the CDM mechanism generate Certified Emissions Reductions CERs - Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the JI mechanism generate Emission Reduction Units ERUs The CERs and ERUs can then be sold through Emissions Trading The demand for the CERs and ERUs being traded is driven by - Shortfalls in national emission reduction obligations under the Kyoto Protocol - Shortfalls amongst entities obligated under local emissions reduction schemes Nations which have failed to deliver their Kyoto emissions reductions obligations can enter Emissions Trading to purchase CERs and ERUs to cover their treaty shortfalls Nations and groups of nations can also create local emission reduction schemes which place mandatory carbon dioxide emission targets on entities within their national boundaries If the rules of a scheme allow the obligated entities may be able to cover all or some of any reduction shortfalls by purchasing CERs and ERUs through Emissions Trading While local emissions reduction schemes have no status under the Kyoto Protocol itself they play a prominent role in creating the demand for CERs and ERUs stimulating Emissions Trading and setting a market price for emissions A well-known mandatory local emissions trading scheme is the EU Emissions Trading Scheme EU ETS New changes are being made to the trading schemes The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is set to make some new changes within the next year The new changes will target the emissions produced by flight travel in and out of the European Union   Other nations are scheduled to start participating in Emissions Trading Schemes within the next few year These nations include China India and the United States   Voluntary market mechanisms edit In contrast to the strict rules set out for the mandatory market the voluntary market provides companies with different options to acquire emissions reductions A solution comparable with those developed for the mandatory market has been developed for the voluntary market the Verified Emission Reductions VER This measure has the great advantage that the projects/activities are managed according to the quality standards set out for CDM/JI projects but the certificates provided are not registered by the governments of the host countries or the Executive Board of the UNO As such high quality VERs can be acquired at lower costs for the same project quality However at present VERs can not be used in the mandatory market The voluntary market in North America is divided between members of the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Over The Counter OTC market The Chicago Climate Exchange is a voluntary yet legally binding cap-and-trade emission scheme whereby members commit to the capped emission reductions and must purchase allowances from other members or offset excess emissions The OTC market does not involve a legally binding scheme and a wide array of buyers from the public and private spheres as well as special events that want to go carbon neutral Being carbon neutral refers to achieving net zero carbon emissions by balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset or buying enough carbon credits to make up the difference There are project developers wholesalers brokers and retailers as well as carbon funds in the voluntary market Some businesses and nonprofits in the voluntary market encompass more than just one of the activities listed above A report by Ecosystem Marketplace shows that carbon offset prices increase as it moves along the supply chain from project developer to retailer   While some mandatory emission reduction schemes exclude forest projects these projects flourish in the voluntary markets A major criticism concerns the imprecise nature of GHG sequestration quantification methodologies for forestry projects However others note the community co-benefits that forestry projects foster Project types in the voluntary market range from avoided deforestation afforestation/reforestation industrial gas sequestration increased energy efficiency fuel switching methane capture from coal plants and livestock and even renewable energy Renewable Energy Certificates RECs sold on the voluntary market are quite controversial due to additionality concerns   Industrial Gas projects receive criticism because such projects only apply to large industrial plants that already have high fixed costs Siphoning off industrial gas for sequestration is considered picking the low hanging fruit which is why credits generated from industrial gas projects are the cheapest in the voluntary market The size and activity of the voluntary carbon market is difficult to measure The most comprehensive report on the voluntary carbon markets to date was released by Ecosystem Marketplace and New Carbon Finance in July     ON of Japan is firstly approved by Japanese authority to indicate carbon footprint on three private brand goods in October   Ways to reduce carbon footprint edit The most common way to reduce the carbon footprint of humans is to Reduce Reuse Recycle Refuse In manufacturing this can be done by recycling the packing materials by selling the obsolete inventory of one industry to the industry who is looking to buy unused items at lesser price to become competitive Nothing should be disposed off into the soil all the ferrous materials which are prone to degrade or oxidize with time should be sold as early as possible at reduced price This can also be done by using reusable items such as thermoses for daily coffee or plastic containers for water and other cold beverages rather than disposable ones If that option isn't available it is best to properly recycle the disposable items after use When one household recycles at least half of their household waste they can save     tons of carbon dioxide annually   unreliable source? Another easy option is to drive less By walking or biking to the destination rather than driving not only is a person going to save money on gas but they will be burning less fuel and releasing fewer emissions into the atmosphere However if walking is not an option one can look into carpooling or mass transportation options in their area Yet another option for reducing the carbon footprint of humans is to use less air conditioning and heating in the home By adding insulation to the walls and attic of one's home and installing weather stripping or caulking around doors and windows one can lower their heating costs more than   percent Similarly one can very inexpensively upgrade the \"insulation\" clothing worn by residents of the home   For example it's estimated that wearing a base layer of long underwear top and bottom made from a lightweight super insulating fabric like microfleece aka Polartec Capilene can conserve as much body heat as a full set of clothing allowing a person to remain warm with the thermostat lowered by over   C     These measures all help because they reduce the amount of energy needed to heat and cool the house One can also turn down the heat while sleeping at night or away during the day and keep temperatures moderate at all times Setting the thermostat just   degrees lower in winter and higher in summer could save about   ton of carbon dioxide each year   unreliable source? Choice of diet is a major influence on a person's carbon footprint Animal sources of protein especially red meat rice typically produced in high methane-emitting paddies foods transported long distance and/or via fuel-inefficient transport e g highly perishable produce flown long distance and heavily processed and packaged foods are among the major contributors to a high carbon diet Scientists at the University of Chicago have estimated   \"that the average American diet which derives 28% of its calories from animal foods is responsible for approximately one and a half more tonnes of greenhouse gasses as CO   equivalents per person per year than a fully plant-based or vegan diet \"   Their calculations suggest that even replacing one third of the animal protein in the average American's diet with plant protein e g beans grains can reduce the diet's carbon footprint by half a tonne Exchanging two thirds of the animal protein with plant protein is roughly equivalent to switching from a Toyota Camry to a Prius Finally throwing food out not only adds its associated carbon emissions to a person or household's footprint it adds the emissions of transporting the wasted food to the garbage dump and the emissions of food decomposition mostly in the form of the highly potent greenhouse gas methane The carbon handprint movement emphasizes individual forms of carbon offsetting like using more public transportation or planting trees in deforested regions to reduce one's carbon footprint and increase their \"handprint \"   Furthermore the carbon footprint in the food industry can be reduced by optimizing the supply chain A life cycle or supply chain carbon footprint study can provide useful data which will help the business to identify critical areas for improvement and provides a focus Such studies also demonstrate a company s commitment to reducing carbon footprint now ahead of other competitors as well as preparing companies for potential regulation In addition to increased market advantage and differentiation eco-efficiency can also help to reduce costs where alternative energy systems are implemented A July   study published in Environmental Research Letters argued that the most significant way individuals could mitigate their own carbon footprint is to have fewer children followed by living without a vehicle forgoing air travel and adopting a plant-based diet     edit Science portal   Degrees and Beyond International Climate Conference 2000-watt society Avoiding dangerous climate change Carbon accounting Carbon cycle

document divided into   chapters that have been grouped into   sections Section I Social and Economic Dimensions is directed toward combating poverty especially in developing countries changing consumption patterns promoting health achieving a more sustainable population and sustainable settlement in decision making Section II Conservation and Management of Resources for Development includes atmospheric protection combating deforestation protecting fragile environments conservation of biological diversity biodiversity control of pollution and the management of biotechnology and radioactive wastes Section III Strengthening the Role of Major Groups includes the roles of children and youth women NGOs local authorities business and industry and workers and strengthening the role of indigenous peoples their communities and farmers Section IV Means of Implementation includes science technology transfer education international institutions and financial mechanisms Development and evolution edit The full text of Agenda   was made public at the UN Conference on Environment and Development Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro on June     where   governments voted to adopt the program The final text was the result of drafting consultation and negotiation beginning in   and culminating at the two-week conference Rio+5   edit In   the UN General Assembly held a special session to appraise the status of Agenda   Rio +5 The Assembly recognized progress as \"uneven\" and identified key trends including increasing globalization widening inequalities in income and continued deterioration of the global environment A new General Assembly Resolution S-19/2 promised further action Rio+10   edit   World Summit on Sustainable Development The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation agreed to at the World Summit on Sustainable Development Earth Summit   affirmed UN commitment to \"full implementation\" of Agenda   alongside achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and other international agreements Agenda   for culture   edit   Agenda   for culture The first World Public Meeting on Culture held in Porto Alegre Brazil in   came up with the idea to establish guidelines for local cultural policies something comparable to what Agenda   was for the environment   They are to be included in various subsections of Agenda   and will be carried out through a wide range of sub-programs beginning with G8 countries citation needed Rio+20   edit   United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development In   at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development the attending members reaffirmed their commitment to Agenda   in their outcome document called \"The Future We Want\"   nation leaders participated Sustainable Development Summit   edit   Sustainable Development Goals Agenda   also known as the Sustainable Development Goals was a set of goals decided upon at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in     It takes all of the goals set by Agenda   and re-asserts them as the basis for sustainable development saying We reaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development   Adding onto those goals from the original Rio document a total of   goals have been agreed on revolving around the same concepts of Agenda   people planet prosperity peace and partnership   Implementation edit The Commission on Sustainable Development acts as a high-level forum on sustainable development and has acted as preparatory committee for summits and sessions on the implementation of Agenda   The UN Division for Sustainable Development acts as the secretariat to the Commission and works \"within the context of\" Agenda   Implementation by member states remains voluntary and its adoption has varied Local level edit   International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives The implementation of Agenda   was intended to involve action at international national regional and local levels Some national and state governments have legislated or advised that local authorities take steps to implement the plan locally as recommended in Chapter   of the document These programs are often known as \"Local Agenda 21\" or \"LA21\"   For example in the Philippines the plan is \"Philippines Agenda 21\" PA21 The group ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability formed in   today its members come from over     cities towns and counties in   countries and is widely regarded as a paragon of Agenda   implementation   Europe turned out to be the continent where LA21 was best accepted and most implemented   In Sweden for example all local governments have implemented a Local Agenda   initiative   Regional levels edit This section needs expansion You can help by adding to it June   The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs' Division for Sustainable Development monitors and evaluates progress nation by nation towards the adoption of Agenda   and makes these reports available to the public on its website   Australia edit Australia is a signatory to Agenda   and   of its municipalities subscribe to ICLEI an organization that promotes Agenda   globally Australia's membership is second only to that of the United States   Africa edit In Africa national support for Agenda   is strong and most countries are signatories But support is often closely tied to environmental challenges specific to each country for example in   Sam Nujoma who was then President of Namibia spoke about the importance of adhering to Agenda   at the   Earth Summit noting that as a semi-arid country Namibia sets a lot of store in the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification UNCCD   Furthermore there is little mention of Agenda   at the local level in indigenous media Only major municipalities in sub-Saharan African countries are members of ICLEI Agenda   participation in North African countries mirrors that of Middle Eastern countries with most countries being signatories but little to no adoption on the local-government level Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa generally have poorly documented Agenda   status reports citation needed By contrast South Africa 's participation in Agenda   mirrors that of modern Europe with   city members of ICLEI and support of Agenda   by national-level government citation needed North America edit United States edit The national focal point in the United States is the Division Chief for Sustainable Development and Multilateral Affairs Office of Environmental Policy Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs U S Department of State   A June   poll of     United States voters by the American Planning Association found that 9% supported Agenda   6% opposed it and 85% thought they didn't have enough information to form an opinion   Support edit The United States is a signatory country to Agenda   but because Agenda   is a legally non-binding statement of intent and not a treaty the United States Senate did not hold a formal debate or vote on it It is therefore not considered to be law under Article Six of the United States Constitution President George H W Bush was one of the   heads of government who signed the final text of the agreement at the Earth Summit in       and in the same year Representatives Nancy Pelosi Eliot Engel and William Broomfield spoke in support of United States House of Representatives Concurrent Resolution   supporting implementation of Agenda   in the United States     Created by a   Executive Order the President's Council on Sustainable Development PCSD is explicitly charged with recommending a national action plan for sustainable development to the President The PCSD is composed of leaders from government and industry as well as from environmental labor and civil rights organizations The PCSD submitted its report \"Sustainable America A New Consensus\" to the President in early   In the absence of a multi-sectoral consensus on how to achieve sustainable development in the United States the PCSD was conceived to formulate recommendations for the implementation of Agenda   In the United States over   cities are members of ICLEI an international sustainability organization that helps to implement the Agenda   and Local Agenda   concepts across the world The United States has nearly half of the ICLEI's global membership of     cities promoting sustainable development at a local level   The United States also has one of the most comprehensively documented Agenda   status reports   In response to the opposition Don Knapp U S spokesman for the ICLEI has said \"Sustainable development is not a top-down conspiracy from the U N but a bottom-up push from local governments\"   The Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry successfully lobbied against an anti-sustainable development bill in   arguing \"It would be bad for business\" as it could drive away corporations that have embraced sustainable development   Opposition edit Anti-Agenda   conspiracy theories have circulated in the U S Some Tea Party movement activists and others promoted the notion that Agenda   was part of a UN plot to deny property rights undermine U S sovereignty or force citizens to move to cities           Activists believed that the non-binding UN resolution was \"the linchpin in a plot to subjugate humanity under an eco-totalitarian regime \"   The conspiracy theory had its roots in anti-environmentalist ideology and opposition to land-use regulation   Agenda   fears have played a role in opposition to local government's efforts to promote resource and land conservation build bike lanes and construct hubs for public transportation   The non-profit group ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA - was targeted by anti-Agenda   activists   In   Glenn Beck co-wrote a dystopian novel titled Agenda   based in part on concepts discussed in the UN plan       In the same year fears of Agenda   \"went mainstream\" when the Republican National Committee adopted a platform resolution stated that \"We strongly reject the U N Agenda   as erosive of American sovereignty \"     Several state and local governments have considered or passed motions and legislation opposing Agenda         Most such bills failed \"either dying in committee getting defeated on the statehouse floor or in the case of Missouri 's   bill getting vetoed by the governor \"   In Texas for example broadly worded legislation that would prohibit any governmental entity from accepting from or granting money to any \"nongovernmental or intergovernmental organization accredited by the United Nations to implement a policy that originated in the Agenda   plan\" was defeated because it could have cut off funding for groups such as 4-H the Boy Scouts of America and the Texas Wildlife Association   In Arizona a similarly sweeping bill was introduced in the Arizona State Legislature seeking to mandate that the state could not \"adopt or implement the creed doctrine or principles or any tenet\" of Agenda   and to prohibit the state \"implementing programs of expending any sum of money for being a member of receiving funding from contracting services from or giving financial or other forms of aid to\" an array of sustainability organizations   The bill which was opposed by the state chamber of commerce and the mayor of Phoenix was defeated in     Alabama was one state that did adopt an anti-Agenda   resolution unanimously passing in   a measure to block \"any future effort to 'deliberately or

capitalism     navigation search Sustainable capitalism is a conceptual form of capitalism based upon sustainable practices that seek to preserve humanity and the planet while reducing externalities and bearing a resemblance of capitalist economic policy A capitalistic economy must expand to survive and find new markets to support this expansion   Capitalist systems are often thought to be destructive to the environment as well as certain individuals without access to proper representation However sustainability provides quite the opposite it implies not only a continuation but a replenishing of resources   Sustainability is often thought of to be related to environmentalism and sustainable capitalism applies sustainable principles to economic governance and social aspects of capitalism as well The importance of sustainable capitalism has been more recently recognized but the concept is not new Changes to the current economic model would have heavy social environmental and economic implications and require the efforts of individuals as well as compliance of local state and federal governments Controversy surrounds the concept as it requires an increase in sustainable practices and a marked decrease in current consumptive behaviors   This is a concept of capitalism described in Al Gore and David Blood s manifesto for the Generation Investment Management to describe a long-term political economic and social structure which would mitigate current threats to the planet and society   According to their manifesto sustainable capitalism would integrate the environmental social and governance ESG aspects into risk assessment in attempt to limit externalities   Most of the ideas they list are related to economic changes and social aspects but strikingly few are explicitly related to any environmental policy change   Contents   Governance and economic aspects   Environmental aspects   Social aspects   Criticism     Marxist view     Sustainable capitalism as an oxymoron     Government reluctance       References Governance and economic aspects edit Economic aspects are clearest perhaps because the economy is most easily associated with capitalism Sustainable capitalism as a policy outline is an attempt to address and tackle the use of admittedly insufficient tools used today to measure the economic growth and the real value of countries such as GDP or GO Criticism of this form of growth measurement is centered on the fact that GDP fails to account for labor conditions and other environmental factors which have a long-term influence on the value which it measures   This concept follows recent trends that see forms of sustainable business as the preferred method for development because of the way that these types of businesses offer a positive influence to their environment Many of these stem from business-led corporate responsibility coalitions which aim to mitigate ESG impacts through mobilization of resources   These business are not limited to the traditional non-profits we associate with corporate responsibility but also can be independent non-profit for-profit led by a board of directors or core-funded   The wide spectrum of business types shows the gradual turn towards socially and environmentally responsible corporate governance Sustainable capitalism challenges the common model of the capitalist economy by its linear frame Raw materials either natural resources or intellect when combined with a capital increasing mechanism like worker power create marketable products that are sold for money and waste In the concept of sustainable capitalism it appears to be necessary to shift to a more circular economy where the end product would be reinvested not only to the capitalist business or financial institution but into the basis for raw materials and people who support this business   This type of circular economy would require more responsibility on corporate governance to reduce externalities China has made advances in this area increasing renewable energy industries with an estimate that fossil fuels will no longer be the main source of energy by   these steps toward change were forced in part by high pollution and population   In their manifesto Gore and Blood propose key economic measures to change from the current form of capitalism Identify and incorporate risks from stranded assets Mandate integrated reporting End the default practice of issuing quarterly earnings guidance Align compensation structures with long-term sustainable performance Encourage long-term investing with loyalty-driven securities   Reinforce sustainability as a fiduciary issue Create advisory services for sustainable asset management Expand the range and depth of sustainable investment products Reconsider the appropriate definition for growth beyond GDP Integrate sustainability into business education at all levels   The first five items are most related to economic changes while the last five are actions more related to social aspects Of these ten only two are directly related to environmental aspects and none explicitly suggest environmental policy changes Environmental aspects edit As explained by Bruce Ledewitz sustainable capitalism is the adoption and development of sustainable practices that protect natural resources instead of spending it as capital Ledewitz claims that in traditional capitalism natural capital meaning natural resources will continue to decline and will limit monetary capital success lifting the value of natural resources and replacing the definition of prosperity He proposes that sustainable capitalism would institute policies and regulations to protect natural resources in addition to investing back into the environment in attempt to reverse the degradation   Social aspects edit Social aspects of sustainable capitalism involve a positive reception toward climate change Author Mohan Munasinghe explains that two specific ways that humans can respond to climate change are through adaptation and mitigation First adaptation is aimed at reducing the vulnerability of human and natural systems in the face of climate change stresses while mitigation is aimed at lowering or removing GHG emissions to reduce radiative forcing of the atmosphere and the intensity of future climate change   Economist John Ikerd claims that environmental degradation happens under modern capitalism because the economy is divorced from ethics   According to him classical economists like Adam Smith had always intended for market economics to be tempered by property owners' moralities and neoclassical economists put undue faith in the ability of markets to automatically adjust to physical and moral imperatives Ikerd concludes that a system of environmental regulations founded on a popular ethical consensus is necessary and sufficient to prevent excessive climate change   Sustainable capitalism is also viewed as a non-transcendent regulated commodity to humanity due to the ever-increasing demands of environmental regulation   Geoffrey Strickland emphasizes that current discussions on economic development are led by the notion that human reproduction is a commodity that must be regulated and improved in order to encourage market efficiency which is a phenomenon that counteracts the growth of capitalism   Criticism edit   Steady-state economy Capitalism without growth Marxist view edit According to the Marxist understanding of capitalism as production for profit it is impossible to prioritize environmental sustainability without abolishing capitalism Ernest Mandel claims that when profit maximization requires a business to pollute the air \"the simple right to clean air is abolished\"   Under his conception of capitalism profit necessarily subjugates the environment and properly accounting for the social costs of production requires some form of socialist planning Any attempt to adequately protect the environment within such a capitalist framework is doomed to fail so the argument goes because society simply is not structured to be willing to sacrifice private profits for public endeavors on this scale   Sustainable capitalism as an oxymoron edit The Capital Institute describes the concept of sustainable capitalism as an oxymoron   They argue that modern capitalism is not designed for cooperation and much of the proposed measures in the manifesto are insufficient   Regeneration cooperation and well-being are aspects of sustainability that do not coincide with what capitalism has evolved to be Efforts may be made to reform current capitalistic practices but mass movements focusing on environmental concerns that do not create a radical change of the system are not likely to succeed as they go against what capitalism was designed to achieve Capitalism and sustainability are mutually exclusive ideas given the current model   Government reluctance edit Critics such as Neil E Harrison argue that the government would likely be resistant to sustainable changes for the current capitalist model Since the capitalist government was built upon capitalist ideals and business interests he argues the government is dependent on the system   Often the government is most focused on overt crises rather than long-term solutions to problems that are not readily apparent His main argument is that beyond the current structure authority is not enough to control the social and economic aspects enough to truly impact the environmental needs     edit Accumulation by

 navigation search Environmental racism is a term used to describe environmental injustice within a racialized context In some which? specify Western nations environmental racism refers to socially marginalized racial minority communities which are subjected to disproportionate exposure of pollutants the denial of access to sources of ecological benefits such as clean air water and natural resources or both Within an international context environmental marginalization may apply to disadvantaged ecological relationships between industrialized nations and the Global South and is often associated with colonialism neoliberalism and globalization Instances of environmental racism can include exposure to toxic waste flooding pollution from heavy industrial or natural resource extraction developments lack of utilities such as clean water or exclusion from land management and natural resource-related decision making Historically the term is tied to the environmental justice social movement that began in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States   There is discourse on environmental racism in the U S among progressive academics and climate advocacy groups who   focus on cases from other countries Environmental justice is just the movement that was created in order to help stop environmental racism from starting   Although environmental racism has been historically tied to the environmental justice throughout the years the term has dissociated more and more from the environmental justice movement   Since environmental racism is dissociating more from the environmental justice movement and one of the reasons for that is due to the non-acknowledgement of environmental racism occurring in the first place On the international level policies that have been described as environmentally racist include corporations exporting dirty technologies dangerous chemicals or waste materials banned by domestic laws to developing countries with lax environmental policies and safety practices pollution havens Contents   Background     Definition   United States     Cases       Flint Michigan       San Antonio Texas Kelly Airforce Base       Warren County North

Nigeria   Responses     Studies     Legislation   Cost-benefit analysis and policy implications       References     Background edit The first report to draw a relationship between race income and risk of exposure to pollutants was the Council of Environmental Quality's \"Annual Report to the President\" in     After protests in Warren County North Carolina the United Church of Christ commissioned a report exploring the concept   In   Robert D Bullard a sociologist at Texas Southern University completed a report describing the futile attempt of an affluent African-American community in Houston Texas to block the siting of a hazardous waste landfill in their community This paper provided evidence that race not just income status was a probable factor in this local \"uninvited\" land-use decision In   Sidney Howe Director of the Human Environment Center suggested that people positioned in a lower socioeconomic level of their respective communities were exposed to more pollution than others and that those creating the most pollution live in the least polluted places He used the term environmental justice to describe the corrective measures needed to address this disparity   Those claims have not been evaluated During the 1980s African-Americans began organizing environmental campaigns to avoid poisoning farm workers with pesticides lead poisoning in inner-city children the zoning of toxic facilities such as landfills polluting industrial complexes and incinerators In addition many Americans questioned the placement of large numbers of nuclear waste dumps on Native-American reservations Meanwhile activists scholars and policymakers began investigating the link between race and exposure to environmental hazards Two studies exploring this relationship one by the U S General Accounting Office US GAO and the other by the United Church of Christ UCC found that African-Americans and other people of color were more likely to live close to hazardous waste sites and facilities than whites The study by the UCC was particularly important because it made an explicit connection between race and the increased likelihood of being exposed to hazardous wastes The studies also made the issue of race and the environment more salient in communities of color   The term environmental racism came into use at a conference held at the University of Michigan 's School of Natural Resources in   The conference which focused on race and environmental hazards brought together scholars and policymakers to discuss the relationship between racism and the environment In addition the term environmental equity movement was used in the late 1980s to describe the growing movement to address racial gender and class environmental inequalities   In this line of thinking environmental racism includes but is not limited to greater probability of exposure to environmental hazards uneven negative effects of environmental procedures uneven negative effects of environmental policies intentional targeting and zoning of toxic facilities in minority communities segregation of minority workers in hazardous jobs minority communities with little access to or insufficient maintenance of environmental amenities for example parks and disproportionate access to environmental services such as garbage removal   Definition edit One area of contention relating to the definition of the term is intent Some definitions hold that only intentional discrimination against minorities in issues regarding the environment is what constitutes environmental racism while others focus on the presence of unfavorable environmental conditions for minorities intentional or not     Benjamin Chavis African American civil rights leader highlighted the importance of intent stating that \"environmental racism is racial discrimination in environmental policy-making and enforcement of regulations and laws the deliberate targeting of communities of color for toxic waste facilities the official sanctioning of the presence of life threatening poisons and pollutants for communities of color and the history of excluding people of color from leadership of the environmental movement\"   Those who are critical of this viewpoint suggest that it is restrictive because deliberate racism is just one of a variety of forms of racism   Even if it's not intentional some groups for a number of reasons are more likely to be present in areas of environmental hazard and pollution than others Thus lack of intentionality doesn't necessarily mean that it's not environmental racism The difficulty of proving group intent versus individual intent is one of the reasons why the intentionality requirement found in some definitions is seen as limiting   United States edit The U S Government Accountability Office GAO issued a report addressing correlations between the siting of four hazardous waste facilities and the racial background of an area's residents   Opposing hazardous waste sites requires time money and political engagement Resources such as meeting places access to public records and funding for technical assistance are also required for action   Minority groups may not have access to these resources creating challenges for groups fighting against the placement of unwanted land use Further controversial projects are less likely to be sited in areas expected to pursue collective action   Some studies suggest that the lack of opposition to these hazardous sites could be due to economic impacts in a given area where jobs in a community are dependent on the site   Non-minority communities are more likely to succeed when opposing the siting of hazardous waste and sewage treatment facilities incinerators and freeways in their areas   Non-minority communities have better opportunities to access these tools and resources for preventing the placement of toxic sites as well as the negative impacts of environmental policy decisions While some social scientists see the siting of hazardous facilities in minority communities as a demonstration of intentional racism whereby these communities are targeted for prejudicial reasons belief in racial inferiority or a desire to protect racial group privilege   others see the causes of environmental racism as structural and institutional The traditional perspective views discrimination as more individualistic sporadic and episodic than the institutional perspective   Processes such as suburbanization gentrification and decentralization lead to patterns of environmental racism even absent intentionally discriminatory policies For example the process of suburbanization or white flight consists of non-minorities leaving industrial zones for safer cleaner and less expensive suburban locales Meanwhile minority communities are left in the inner cities and in close proximity to polluted industrial zones In these areas unemployment is high and businesses are less likely to invest in area improvement creating poor economic conditions for residents and reinforcing a social formation that reproduces racial inequality   Furthermore the poverty of property owners and residents in a municipality may be taken into consideration by hazardous waste facility developers since areas with depressed real estate values will cut expenses   A comprehensive study of particulate emissions across the United States published in   found that Blacks were exposed to 54% more particulate matter emissions soot than the average American     Cases edit Flint Michigan edit   Flint water crisis Since April   residents of Flint a city that is almost   percent black and notably impoverished have been drinking and bathing in water that contains enough lead to meet the Environmental Protection Agency's definition of \"toxic waste\" Before   when the city of Flint switched to their own river as means of water Lake Huron provided the area with water Researchers at Virginia Tech discovered in   that the Flint River is   times more corrosive than Lake Huron Lead contamination can engender multiple health conditions A November   class-action lawsuit describes how Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality failed to treat the new water source with an anti-corrosive agent thereby causing the water to become increasingly discolored Adding that agent orthophosphate would have cost $100 per day according to CNN and   percent of the problems with Flint's water would have been averted if it had been used   After an official investigation was conducted Michigan's attorney general Bill Schuette initially filed charges against three government officials Those charged were two state officials of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality Michael Prysby and Stephen Busch and a Flint city employee Michael Glasglow who was the city's water quality supervisor They were brought up against felony charges such as \"misconduct neglect of duty and conspiracy to tamper with evidence\"   They were also charged with violating the Michigan Safe Water Drinking Act   San Antonio Texas Kelly Airforce Base edit This section possibly contains original research Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations Statements consisting only of original research should be removed December   Learn how and when to remove this template message San Antonio 's Kelly Air Force Base KAFB is one of the Air Force's major aircraft maintenance facilities and takes up   acres of land surrounded by residential neighborhoods of primarily Hispanic populations KAFB maintains various parts of aircraft such as jet engines and accessory components and even nuclear materials Research shows that the base can generate as much as     tons of hazardous waste each year   Residents of the nearby communities have complained many times of unusual illnesses their children have experienced   One resident complained her children's legs and arms were bowing and doctors were unable to determine the cause of it They were sent to a specialist who assigned them to sleep with casts on their arms and legs to correct the damage this lasted two years Other cases are showing up now in the surrounding residential areas of KAFB in later generations some children are born missing kidneys ribs and even experience kidney failure and hair loss Other residents are suffering from illnesses as well a   survey done in the residential neighborhoods close to KAFB showed 91% of adults and 79% of children are suffering from conditions ranging from nose ear and throat issues to central nervous system disorders Scientists released information in   revealing that toxic waste had been dumped into an uncovered pit from   to   The waste in the pit contained various chemicals such as PCB's and DDT This created a problem for residents because it created a mass of toxic waste that contaminated the groundwater A worker from KAFB claims that the Air Force was aware of the chemicals being released into the soil and that the Air Force did so intentionally The chemicals have since gone into the groundwater under the nearby residential areas at least three miles out A shallow aquifer that runs beneath more than     homes and was once the main source of drinking water is now primarily used for watering lawns However even this is not safe because they still have direct contact with the contaminated water through recreational activities Recently there has even been growing concern about the contaminants migrating deeper into the Edwards Aquifer which is the drinking water source for the City of San Antonio   There have been initiatives to clean up the KAFB area In   the EPA listed KAFB as high priority and designated Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission TNRCC to the cleanup of the base as a top priority in the state However because TNRCC was lacking the resources to undertake the cleanup process it contracted KAFB to pay TNRCC to monitor its own cleanup KAFB denied taking any responsibility of the off-site contamination and suggested the neighborhoods could rely on earth's natural processes to handle the contamination which could take up to   years if the base stopped using the pit Much talk around the EPA closing the base forced discussions about the future of the base and included many different grassroots organizations that allowed for people in the neighborhood to be involved in decision-making   These grassroots organizations have filed charges against the EPA TNRCC and the City of San Antonio that state they discriminate against the Latino community living near the base by ignoring their environmental protection and public health needs These charges are still pending and the community to this day still uses contaminated water Some new residents are unaware and move in because of the cheap housing costs while old residents are still fighting for their right to clean water A report prepared by the Department of Health and Human Services reveals that while there is no contamination leaking into Edwards aquifer there are many leakage points within old wells that exist around Kelly Air Force Base and the residential areas The report explains the two main geological zones The shallow aquifer is described in the following from an excerpt of the report \"The top of the shallow aquifer is found 3- to 37-feet below ground surface bgs across Kelly AFB with depths ranging from   to   feet The shallow aquifer generally exists as an unconfined water table aquifer meaning that water can flow freely from the ground surface into the shallow aquifer Below the shallow aquifer seven different layers of clay and rock prevent the shallow aquifer water from going deeper into the ground \"   Atsdr Cdc Gov   The report describes in the following the Edwards aquifer which is used as the main source of drinking water for the residents of the City of San Antonio \"The second main water-bearing zone below Kelly AFB is the Edwards Aquifer Below Kelly AFB the Edwards Aquifer is approximately     feet bgs and slopes to the surface northwest of San Antonio in an area known as the Balcones fault zone Water enters recharges the Edwards Aquifer in the Balcones fault zone via runoff from rain and from the bottom of rivers CH2M Hill   Under natural conditions the Edwards Aquifer is not connected to the shallow aquifer below Kelly AFB Hence surface water does not naturally flow into the Edwards Aquifer below Kelly AFB \" Atsdr Cdc Gov   According to this report there is no contamination in Edwards Aquifer which serves the greater San Antonio area but there is contamination in the wells located around the base as well as in residential areas   Although residents are not supposed to use these wells reports from neighborhood residents state that some still do The area where the base has been releasing chemicals has since been shut down and designated for cleanup Warren County North Carolina edit   Warren County PCB Landfill Racism and environmental justice unified for the first time during the   citizen opposition to a proposed PCB landfill in Warren County North Carolina   North Carolina state officials decided to bury soil contaminated with toxic polychlorinated biphenyls in Afton a small town in Warren County   Between June   and August       gallons   m of polychlorinated biphenyls PCB -contaminated waste were illegally deposited along   miles of North Carolina roads The U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA declared the PCBs a threat to public health and required the state to remove the polluted waste In   the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources and EPA Region   selected Warren County as the site to deposit the PCB-contaminated soil that was collected from the roadsides   Warren County is one of the six counties along the \"black belt\" of North Carolina The counties residing in the \"black belt\" are significantly poorer than the rest of the state In the early 1980s the residents in Warren County earned an average per capita income of $6   compared to $9   for the rest of the state   In   the population of Warren County was   5% African-American   Scientific findings did not support the decision to discharge the PCB contaminated soil in Warren County The site of the landfill was not scientifically feasible due to the shallow water table with the drinking water only     feet below the surface   In   the local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People NAACP filed a lawsuit in the district courts to block the landfill The residents lost the case in court   In September   the outraged citizens of Warren County joined by civil rights groups environmental leaders and clergymen protested the first truckloads of PCB contaminated soil   During the protest over   people were arrested and jailed Despite protests and scientific evidence that the plan would cause drinking water contamination   the Warren County PCB Landfill was built and the toxic waste was placed in the landfill   After nearly two decades of suspected leaks state and federal sources paid a contractor $18 million to detoxify the PCB contaminated soil in Warren County   Warren County is often cited as the first environmental justice case in the United States however this movement started years earlier in   with the discovery of toxic waste in Love Canal New York   Chicago Illinois edit Altgeld Gardens is a housing community located in south Chicago that was built in   on an abandoned landfill to accommodate returning African-American World War II veterans Surrounded by   toxic facilities and 90% of the city's landfills the Altgeld Gardens area became known as a \"toxic doughnut\" With 90% of its population African-American and 65% below the poverty level Altgeld Gardens is considered a classic example of environmental racism   The known toxins and pollutants affecting the Altgeld Gardens area include mercury ammonia gas lead dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane DDT polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs heavy metals and xylene   The residents of Altgeld Gardens are surrounded by landfills a chemical waste incinerator and piles of loose trash These living conditions have affected the health of the community In   a study by Illinois Public Health Sector revealed excessive rates of prostate bladder and lung cancer   Additionally medical records have indicated   high rates of children born with brain tumors   high rates of fetuses that had to be aborted after tests revealed that the brains were developing outside the skull and   higher rates of asthma ringworm and other ailments Despite evidence of health problems the residents of Altgeld Gardens have not been relocated to another public housing project   Chester Pennsylvania edit Chester Pennsylvania provides an example of \"social political and economic forces that shape the disproportionate distribution of environmental hazards in poor communities of color\"   Chester is located in Delaware County an area with a population of     that excluding Chester is 91% white Chester however is 65% African American with the highest minority population and poverty rate in Delaware County   and recipient of a disproportionate amount of environmental risks and hazards   Chester has five large waste facilities including a trash incinerator a medical waste incinerator and a sewage treatment plant   These waste sites in Chester have a total permitted capacity of   million tons of waste per year while the rest of Delaware County has a capacity of merely     tons per year   One of the waste sites located in Chester is the Westinghouse incinerator which burns all of the municipal waste from the entire county and surrounding states   These numerous waste facilities engender very significant health risks to the citizens of Chester as the cancer rate in this area is     times higher than it is anywhere else in Pennsylvania   Also the mortality rate is 40% higher than the rest of Delaware county and the child mortality rate is the highest   The clustering of all of these polluting facilities in Chester points to environmental racism New Orleans Louisiana edit People on the roofs of their houses avoiding the flood New Orleans Louisiana has been cited as an example of past environmental racism At the time of Hurricane Katrina   5% of New Orleans residents were African American a rate nearly 50% higher than in the rest of the United States Pre-existing racial disparities in wealth within New Orleans worsened the outcome of Hurricane Katrina for minority populations Institutionalized racial segregation of neighborhoods left minority members more likely to live in low-lying areas that were more vulnerable to the devastating effects of the Hurricane   Additionally hurricane evacuation plans relied heavily on the use of cars and personal vehicles However because minority populations are less likely to own cars some people had no choice but to stay behind while white majority communities were able to escape A report commissioned by the U S House of Representatives found that political leaders failed to consider the fact that \"100   city residents had no cars and relied on public transit\" and the city's failure to complete its mandatory evacuation led to hundreds of deaths   In the months following the disaster political religious and civil rights groups celebrities and New Orleans residents spoke out against what they believed was racism on the part of the United States government   After the hurricane in a meeting held between the Congressional Black Caucus the National Urban League the Black Leadership Forum the National Council of Negro Women and the NAACP Black leaders criticized the response of the federal government calling it \"slow and incomplete\" and discussed the role of race in this response   Effects on Native American nations edit   Indian removal A pile of American bison skulls they were hunted almost to extinction in the 1870s The United States Army encouraged these massive hunts to force Native Americans off their traditional lands and into reservations further west The Indian Removal Act of   and the Trail of Tears may be considered early examples of environmental racism in the United States By   all tribes east of the Mississippi had been removed to western lands essentially confining them to \"lands that were too dry remote or barren to attract the attention of settlers and corporations\"   Later during World War II military facilities were often located conterminous to reservations leading to a situation in which \"a disproportionate number of the most dangerous military facilities are located near Native American lands\"   More recently Native American lands have been used for waste disposal by the United States and multinational corporations   but illegal dumping poses a greater threat   The International Tribunal of Indigenous People and Oppressed Nations convened in   established to examine the history of criminal activity against indigenous groups in the United States   published a Significant Bill of Particulars outlining grievances indigenous peoples had with the U S including allegations that the United States \"deliberately and systematically permitted aided and abetted solicited and conspired to commit the dumping transportation and location of nuclear toxic medical and otherwise hazardous waste materials on Native American territories in North America and has thus created a clear and present danger to the health safety and physical and mental well-being of Native American People\"   An ongoing issue for Native Americans activists would be the Dakota Access Pipeline The pipeline would start in North Dakota and travel to Illinois Although it does not cross directly on a reservation the pipeline is under scrutiny because it passes under a section of the Missouri river which is a key water source for Native American tribes such as the Standing Rock Sioux The pipeline also traverses a sacred burial ground for the Standing Rock Sioux The tribe is upset because they argue the federal government did not adequately engage the Standing Rock Sioux during the permitting process which is required by the Federal Government   Homer Forest Grove and Center Springs Louisiana edit In   the Louisiana Energy Services LES a British German and American conglomerate conducted a nationwide search to find the \"best\" site to build a privately owned uranium enrichment plant The LES claimed to use an objective scientific method to select Louisiana as the \"best\" place to build the plant In response to the selection the communities of Homer Forest Grove and Center Springs that are nearby the proposed site formed a group called Citizens against Nuclear Trash CANT With the help of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund later changed to Earth Justice Legal Defense Fund CANT sued LES for practicing environmental racism Finally after   years on May     a three-judge panel of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board made their final initial decision The panel found that racial bias did play a role in the selection process In response to the victory on May     the London Times declared \"Louisiana Blacks Win Nuclear War\" The courts decision was also upheld on appeal on April       The neutrality of the style of writing in this article is

to get new housing Eventually after protesting and making the issue a public matter Shell eventually agreed to relocate the residents Lerner     Early Activism edit Manifestations of environmental racism predate the coining of such terminology Before the 1970s communities of color recognized this reality and organized against it For example the Black Panther Party organized survival programs that confronted the inequitable distribution of trash in predominantly black neighborhoods   Similarly the Young Lords a Puerto Rican revolutionary nationalist organization based in Chicago and New York City protested pollution and toxic refuse present in their community via their Garbage Offensive program These and other organizations also worked to confront the maldistribution of open spaces toxic lead paint and healthy food options   They also offered health programs to those affected by preventable environmentally induced diseases such as tuberculosis   In this way these organizations serve as precusors to more pointed movements against environmental racism International edit For information on environmental racism in Europe see Environmental racism in Europe Environmental racism also exists on an international scale Environmental racism on a world scale exists between groups in the developed world and groups in the developing world and between different races and ethnicities on different continents First world corporations often produce dangerous chemicals banned in the United States and export them to developing countries or send waste materials to countries with relaxed environmental laws This has been described as environmental racism   In one alleged instance the French aircraft carrier Clemenceau was prohibited from entering Alang an Indian ship-breaking yard due to a lack of clear documentation about its toxic contents French President Jacques Chirac ultimately ordered the carrier which contained tons of hazardous materials including asbestos and PCBs to return to France   In another example of alleged foreign environmental racism in   both the Union Carbide chemical plant in Bhopal India and the PEMEX liquid propane gas plant in Mexico City blew up killing thousands and injuring roughly a million nearby residents   The images of the victims in India and Mexico spread interest in environmental racism around the globe On the other hand some countries have small \"eco laws\" and are more prone to accept dangerous industries Cases edit Electronic waste in Guiyu China edit Electronics companies are constantly coming out with new technologies rendering old models obsolete These older technologies can be sent to recycling depots for proper dismantling however there is a large component of technology that gets shipped overseas to less developed countries for inexpensive labour-intensive recycling From the mid-1990s until about   it is estimated that some   to   percent of the electronics collected for recycling in the western half of the United States was being exported for dismantling overseas predominantly to China and Southeast Asia   This scrap processing is quite profitable due to an abundant workforce and cheap labour   Proper disposal and recycling of these electronics is difficult labour-intensive and therefore expensive   As a result large quantities of the waste are shipped overseas to places where the labour is cheap and the environmental laws are lax   These electronics produce vast amounts of waste when not properly dismantled or disposed of E-waste disposal sites such as one in Guiyu China are also subjects of controversy In the town heaps of discarded computer parts rise near the riverbanks and their toxic substances such as cadmium copper lead PBDEs and numerous persistent organic compounds seep into and poison the local water supply   Water samples taken by the Basel Action Network in   from the Lianjiang River contained lead levels   times higher than WHO safety standards   After the e-waste began arriving the groundwater in Guiyu became undrinkable As a consequence the villages must get their drinking water trucked in which is quite expensive causing people to still use the contaminated water for some activities   These chemicals and toxins bioaccumulate in fatty tissue and biomagnify up the food chain   In Guiyu labourers with no protective clothing regularly burn plastics and circuit boards from old computers They pour acid on electronic parts to extract silver and gold and crush cathode ray tubes from computer monitors to remove other valuable metals such as lead Nearly   percent of children in the e-waste hub of Guiyu China suffer from lead poisoning according to recent reports   Much of the area of Guiyu before the electronic waste was agriculturally based with many small farmers making their living   Farming has been abandoned for more lucrative work in scrap electronics   \"According to the Western press and both Chinese university and NGO researchers conditions in these workers' rural villages are so poor that even the primitive electronic scrap industry in Guiyu offers an improvement in income\"   There were more incentives for the residents of Guiyu to move from farming to electronics dismantling The citizens of Guiyu more than likely did not have significant political influence or the capital to stop electronic waste coming into the area Chevron/Texaco in Ecuador edit Aftermath of Lago Agrio oil field Due to their lack of environmental laws emerging countries like Ecuador have been subjected to environmental pollution sometimes causing health problems loss of agriculture and poverty In       Ecuadorians which included Cofan Siona Huaorani and Quichua indigenous people filed a lawsuit against Texaco oil company for the environmental damages caused by oil extraction activities in the Lago Agrio oil field After handing control of the oil fields to an Ecuadorian oil company Texaco did not properly dispose of its hazardous waste causing great damages to the ecosystem and crippling communities   Union Carbide chemical leak in Bhopal India edit   Bhopal disaster The main corporation Union Carbide Corporation is the parent company of Union Carbide India Limited The company outsourced its production to another country Union Carbide India Limited was located in Bhopal India and primarily produced the chemical methyl isocyanate used for pesticide manufacture   On December     a cloud of methyl isocyanate leaked as a result of the toxic chemical mixing with water in the plant in Bhopal   Approximately     people were exposed to the toxic chemical immediately after the leak   Within the first   days after the leak an estimated     people living within the vicinity of the plant died from exposure to the methyl isocyanate   Some people survived the initial leak from the factory but due to improper care and improper diagnoses many have died   As a consequence of improper diagnoses treatment may have been ineffective and this was precipitated by Union Carbide refusing to release all the details regarding the leaked gases and lying about certain important information   The delay in supplying medical aid to the victims of the chemical leak made the situation for the survivors even worse   Many today are still experiencing the negative health impacts of the methyl isocyanate leak such as lung fibrosis impaired vision tuberculosis neurological disorders severe body pains and many more medical conditions   The operations and maintenance of the factory in Bhopal contributed to the hazardous chemical leak The storage of huge volumes of methyl isocyanate in a densely inhabited area was in contravention with company policies strictly practiced in other plants   The company ignored protests that they were holding too much of the dangerous chemical for one plant and built large tanks to hold it in a crowded community   Methyl isocyanate must be stored at extremely low temperatures but the company cut expenses to the air conditioning system leading to less than optimal conditions for the chemical   Union Carbide India Limited never created disaster management plans for the surrounding community around the factory in the event of a leak or spill   State authorities were in the pocket of the company and therefore did not pay attention to company practices or implementation of the law   The company also cut down on preventative maintenance staff to save money   The company cut corners in order to save some money creating conditions for the leak to occur Niger Delta Nigeria edit Further information Environmental issues in the Niger Delta In Nigeria near the Niger Delta cases of oil spills burning of toxic waste and urban air pollution are problems in more developed areas In the early 1990s Nigeria was among the   nations with the world's highest levels of carbon dioxide emissions which totaled     kilotons a per capita level of     metric tons The UN reported in   that carbon dioxide emissions in Nigeria totaled     kilotons   Numerous webpages were created in support of the Ogoni people who are indigenous to Nigeria's oil-rich Delta region Sites were used to protest the disastrous environmental and economic effects of Shell Oil drilling to urge the boycotting of Shell Oil and to denounce human rights abuses by the Nigerian government and by Shell The use of the Internet in formulating an international appeal intensified dramatically after the Nigerian government's November   execution of nine Ogoni activists including Ken Saro-Wiwa who was one of the founders of the nonviolent Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People MOSOP   Responses edit There are many proposed solutions to the problem of environmental racism Activists have called for \"more participatory and citizen-centered conceptions of justice\"     According to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development one possible solution is the precautionary principle which states that \"where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation\"   Under this principle the initiator of the potentially hazardous activity is charged with demonstrating the activity's safety Environmental justice activists also emphasize the need for waste reduction in general which would act to reduce the overall burden   Concentrations of ethnic or racial minorities may also foster solidarity lending support in spite of challenges and providing the concentration of social capital necessary for grassroots activism Citizens who are tired of being subjected to the dangers of pollution in their communities have been confronting the power structures through organized protest legal actions marches civil disobedience and other activities   There should be more avenues for public participation and public consultation in the decision making processes Other strategies in battling against large companies include public hearings the elections of supporters to state and local offices meetings with company representatives and other efforts to bring about public awareness and accountability   In general political participation in African American communities is correlated with the reduction of health risks and mortality   Studies edit The protests in Warren County North Carolina in   to prevent the siting of a polychlorinated biphenyls landfill in the county became the driving force to a   US General Accounting Office study \"Siting of Hazardous Waste Landfills and Their Correlation with Racial and Economic Status of Surrounding Communities\" The study revealed that \"three of the four commercial hazardous waste landfills in the Southeast United States were located in majority black communities \" The General Accounting Office Study or GAO study solely studied off-site hazardous waste landfills in the Southeastern United States limiting the scope   In response to this limitation the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice or CRJ directed a comprehensive national study on demographic patterns associated with the location of hazardous waste sites   The CRJ national study conducted two examinations of areas surrounding commercial hazardous waste facilities and the location of uncontrolled toxic waste sites   The first study examined the association between race and socio-economic status and the location of commercial hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facilities   After statistical analysis the first study concluded that \"the percentage of community residents that belonged to a racial or ethnic group was a stronger predictor of the level of commercial hazardous waste activity than was household income the value of the homes the number of uncontrolled waste sites or the estimated amount of hazardous wastes generated by industry\"   The second study examined the presence of uncontrolled toxic waste sites in ethnic and racial minority communities and found that   out of every   African and Hispanic Americans lived in communities with uncontrolled waste sites   Other studies like the   \"Toxic Waste and Race in the United States\" by the Commission for Racial Justice found race to be the most influential variable in predicting where waste facilities were located   Deserting the Perpetrator - Victim Model of studying environmental justice issues the Economic/Environmental Justice Model utilized a sharper lens to study the many complex factors accompanied to race that contributes to the act of environmental racism and injustice Using this model the role of history and the overlapping of interest groups stakeholders and organizations are considered in case studies of environmental racism For example Lerner in Diamond A struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor   not only revealed the role of race in the division of Diamond and Norco residents but he also revealed the historical roles of the Shell Oil Company the slave ancestry of Diamond residents and of the history of white workers and families that were dependent upon the rewards of Shell Involvement of outside organizations such as the Bucket Brigade and Greenpeace was also considered in the power that the Diamond community had when battling for environmental justice Legislation edit The export of hazardous waste to third world countries is another growing concern Between   and   an estimated     metric tons of hazardous waste was exported from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD countries to non-OECD countries Two international agreements were passed in response to the growing exportation of hazardous waste into their borders The Organization of African Unity OAU was concerned that the Basel Convention adopted in March   did not include a total ban on the trans-boundary movement on hazardous waste In response to their concerns on January     the Pan-African Conference on Environmental and Sustainable Development adopted the Bamako Convention banning the import of all hazardous waste into Africa and limiting their movement within the continent In September   the G-77 nations helped amend the Basel Convention to ban the export of all hazardous waste from industrial countries mainly OECD countries and Lichtenstein to other countries   Cost-benefit analysis and policy implications edit Cost-benefit analysis CBA is a process that places a monetary value on costs and benefits to evaluate issues   Environmental CBA aims to provide policy solutions for intangible products such as clean air and water by measuring a consumer's willingness to pay for these goods CBA contributes to environmental racism through the valuing of environmental resources based on their utility to society The more someone is willing to pay for a resource such as clean water or air benefits society more than when people are not willing to pay for these goods This creates a burden on poorer areas however by relocating toxic wastes and other environmentally hazardous goods through the justification that they are not willing or able to pay as much as a wealthier area for a clean environment The placement of toxic wastes near poor people lowers the property value of already cheap land Since the decrease in property value is less than that of a cleaner wealthier area the monetary benefits to society are greater by dumping the toxic waste in a \"low-value\" area     edit

problem has proven difficult to solve The modern environmental movement has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways But little progress has been made as shown by severe ecological footprint overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the climate change problem Something within the human system is preventing change to a sustainable mode of behavior That system trait is systemic change resistance Change resistance is also known as organizational resistance barriers to change or policy resistance   Contents   Overview of resistance to solving the sustainability problem   The change resistance and proper coupling subproblems   Systemic versus individual change resistance   The current focus is on proper coupling   Overcoming systemic change resistance   References     Overview of resistance to solving the sustainability problem edit While environmentalism had long been a minor force in political change the movement strengthened significantly in the 1970s with the first Earth Day in   in which over   million people participated with publication of The Limits to Growth in   and with the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in   Early expectations the problem could be solved ran high   out of   members of the United Nations attended the Stockholm conference The conference was widely seen at the time as a harbinger of success   \"Many believe the most important result of the conference was the precedent it set for international cooperation in addressing environmental degradation The nations attending agreed they shared responsibility for the quality of the environment particularly the oceans and the atmosphere and they signed a declaration of principles after extensive negotiations concerning their obligations The conference also approved an environmental fund and an action program which involved   specific recommendations for addressing such problems as global climate change marine pollution population growth the dumping of toxic wastes and the preservation of biodiversity A permanent environment unit was established for coordinating these and other international efforts This later became the United Nations Environmental Program which was was formally approved by the General Assembly later that same year and its base established in Nairobi Kenya This organization not only coordinated action but monitored research collecting and disseminating information and it has played an ongoing role in international negotiations about environmental issues \"The conference in Stockholm accomplished almost everything the preparatory committed had planned It was widely considered successful and many observers were almost euphoric about the extent of agreement \" However despite the work of a worldwide environmental movement many national environmental protection agencies creation of the United Nations Environment Programme and many international environmental treaties the sustainability problem continues to grow worse The latest ecological footprint data shows the world s footprint increased from about 50% undershoot in   to 50% overshoot in   the last year data is available   In   the first edition of The Limits to Growth analyzed the environmental sustainability problem using a system dynamics model The widely influential book predicted that   \"If the present trends in world population industrialization pollution food production and resource depletion continue unchanged the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years The most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity some time in the 21st century \" Yet thirty-two years later in   the third edition reported that   \" The second edition of Limits to Growth was published in   the year of the global summit on environment and development in Rio de Janeiro The advent of the summit seemed to prove that global society had decided to deal seriously with the important environmental problems But we now know that humanity failed to achieve the goals of Rio The Rio plus   conference in Johannesburg in   produced even less it was almost paralyzed by a variety of ideological and economic disputes due to the efforts of those pursuing their narrow national corporate or individual self-interests \" humanity has largely squandered the past   years \" Change resistance runs so high that the world s top two greenhouse gas emitters China and the United States have never adopted the Kyoto Protocol treaty In the US resistance was so strong that in   the US Senate voted   to zero against the treaty by passing the Byrd Hagel Resolution despite the fact Al Gore was vice-president at the time Not a single senator could be persuaded to support the treaty which has not been brought back to the floor since Due to prolonged change resistance the climate change problem has escalated to the climate change crisis Greenhouse gas emissions are rising much faster than IPCC models expected The growth rate of fossil fuel emissions was   5% per year for 2000-2007 an almost four fold increase from   9% per year in 1990-1999 This makes current trends in emissions higher than the worst case IPCC-SRES scenario   The Copenhagen Climate Summit of December   ended in failure   No agreement on binding targets was reached The Cancun Climate Summit in December   did not break the deadlock The best it could do was another non-binding agreement   Recognizing that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet and thus requires to be urgently addressed by all Parties This indicates no progress at all since   when the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was created at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro The   Cancun agreement was the functional equivalent of what the   agreement said   \"The Parties to this Convention acknowledge that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response thus the parties recognize that States should enact effective environmental legislation to protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind \" Negotiations have bogged down so pervasively that Climate policy is gridlocked and there s virtually no chance of a breakthrough   Climate policy as it has been understood and practised by many governments of the world under the Kyoto Protocol approach has failed to produce any discernible real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years   These events suggest that change resistance to solving the sustainability problem is so high the problem is currently unsolvable The change resistance and proper coupling subproblems edit Understanding change resistance requires seeing it as a distinct and separate part of the sustainability problem Tanya Markvart s   thesis on Understanding Institutional Change and Resistance to Change Towards Sustainability stated that   \"It has also been demonstrated that ecologically destructive and inequitable institutional systems can be highly resilient and resistant to change even in the face of social-ecological degradation and/or collapse e g Berkes & Folke   Allison & Hobbs   Brown   Runnalls   Finley   Walker et al   \" The thesis focuses specifically on developing an interdisciplinary theoretical framework for understanding institutional change and resistance to change towards sustainability Jack Harich's   paper on Change Resistance as the Crux of the Environmental Sustainability Problem argues there are two separate problems to solve   A root cause analysis and a system dynamics model were used to explain how \" difficult social problems like sustainability must be decomposed into two sequential subproblems   How to overcome change resistance and then   How to achieve proper coupling This is the timeless strategy of divide and conquer By cleaving one big problem into two the problem becomes an order of magnitude easier to solve because we can approach the two subproblems differently and much more appropriately We are no longer unknowingly attempting to solve two very different problems simultaneously \" The paper discussed the two subproblems \" Change resistance is the tendency for a system to continue its current behavior despite the application of force to change that behavior \" Proper coupling occurs when the behavior of one system affects the behavior of other systems in a desirable manner using the appropriate feedback loops so the systems work together in harmony in accordance with design objectives In the environmental sustainability problem the human system has become improperly coupled to the greater system it lives within the environment \"Change resistance versus proper coupling allows a crucial distinction Society is aware of the proper practices required to live sustainably and the need to do so But society has a strong aversion to adopting these practices As a result problem solvers have created thousands of effective and often ingenious proper practices But they are stymied in their attempts to have them taken up by enough of the system to solve the problem because an 'implicit system goal' is causing insurmountable change resistance Therefore systemic change resistance is the crux of the problem and must be solved first \" The proper coupling subproblem is what most people consider as the problem to solve It is called decoupling in economic and environmental fields where the term refers to economic growth without additional environmental degradation Solving the proper coupling problem is the goal of environmentalism and in particular ecological economics Ecological economics is the study of the interactions and co-evolution in time and space of human economies and the ecosystems in which human economies are embedded   Change resistance is also called barriers to change Hoffman and Bazerman in a chapter on Understanding and overcoming the organizational and psychological barriers to action concluded that   \"In this chapter we argue that the change in thinking required of the sustainability agenda will never come to fruition within practical domains unless proper attention is given to the sources of individual and social resistance to such change The implementation of wise management practices cannot be accomplished without a concurrent set of strategies for surmounting these barriers \" John Sterman current leader of the system dynamics school of thought came to the same conclusion   \"The civil rights movement provides a better analogy for the climate challenge Then as now entrenched special interests vigorously opposed change Of course we need more research and technical innovation money and genius are always in short supply But there is no purely technical solution for climate change For public policy to be grounded in the hard-won results of climate science we must now turn our attention to the dynamics of social and political change \" These findings indicate there are at least two subproblems to be solved change resistance and proper coupling Given the human system s long history of unsuccessful attempts to self-correct to a sustainable mode it appears that high change resistance is preventing proper coupling This may be expressed as an emerging principle systemic change resistance is the crux of the sustainability problem and must be solved first before the human system can be properly coupled to the greater system it lives within the environment Systemic versus individual change resistance edit Systemic change resistance differs significantly from individual change resistance Systemic means originating from the system in such a manner as to affect the behavior of most or all social agents of certain types as opposed to originating from individual agents   Individual change resistance originates from individual people and organizations How the two differ may be seen in this passage   \"The notion of resistance to change is credited to Kurt Lewin His conceptualization of the phrase however is very different from today s usage which treats resistance to change as a psychological concept where resistance or support of change comes from values habits mental models and so on residing within the individual For Lewin resistance to change could occur but that resistance could be anywhere in the system As Kotter   found it is possible for the resistance to be sited within the individual but it is much more likely to be found elsewhere in the system \"Systems of social roles with their associated patterns of attitudes expectations and behavior norms share with biological systems the characteristic of homeostasis i e tendencies to resist change to restore the previous state after a disturbance \"Lewin had been working on this idea that the status quo represented an equilibrium between the barriers to change and the forces favoring change since   as part of his field theory He believed that some difference in these forces weakening of the barriers or strengthening of the driving forces was required to produce the unfreezing that began a change \" If sources of systemic change resistance are present they are the principal cause of individual change resistance According to the fundamental attribution error it is crucial to address systemic change resistance when present and avoid assuming that change resistance can be overcome by bargaining reasoning inspirational appeals and so on This is because   \"A fundamental principle of system dynamics states that the structure of the system gives rise to its behavior However people have a strong tendency to attribute the behavior of others to dispositional rather than situational factors that is to character and especially character flaws rather than the system in which these people are acting The tendency to blame the person rather than the system is so strong psychologists call it the 'fundamental attribution error ' \" Peter Senge a thought leader of systems thinking for the business world describes the structural source of systemic change resistance as being due to an implicit system goal   \"In general balancing loops are more difficult to see than reinforcing loops because it often looks like nothing is happening There s no dramatic growth of sales and marketing expenditures or nuclear arms or lily pads Instead the balancing process maintains the status quo even when all participants want change The feeling as Lewis Carroll s Queen of Hearts put it of needing all the running you can do to keep in the same place is a clue that a balancing loop may exist nearby \"Leaders who attempt organizational change often find themselves unwittingly caught in balancing processes To the leaders it looks as though their efforts are clashing with sudden resistance that seems to come from nowhere In fact as my friend found when he tried to reduce burnout the resistance is a response by the system trying to maintain an implicit system goal Until this goal is recognized the change effort is doomed to failure \" Senge s insight applies to the sustainability problem Until the implicit system goal causing systemic change resistance is found and resolved change efforts to solve the proper coupling part of the sustainability problem may be as Senge argues doomed to failure The current focus is on proper coupling edit Presently environmentalism is focused on solving the proper coupling subproblem For example the following are all proper coupling solutions They attempt to solve the direct cause of the sustainability problem s symptoms The Kyoto Protocol The Three Rs of reduce reuse recycle More use of renewable energy Better pollution control of many kinds Collective management of common-pool resources Certification programs to reduce deforestation such as PEFC and FSC Contour farming to reduce soil erosion The green revolution Zero population growth The direct cause of environmental impact is the three factors on the right side of the I=PAT equation where I mpact equals P opulation times A ffluence consumption per person times T echnology environmental impact per unit of consumption It is these three factors that solutions like those listed above seek to reduce The top environmental organization in the world the United Nations Environmental Programme UNEP focuses exclusively on proper coupling solutions   \"2010 marked the beginning of a period of new strategic and transformational direction for UNEP as it began implementing its Medium Term Strategy MTS for 2010-2013 across six areas Climate change Disasters and conflicts Ecosystem management Environmental governance Harmful substances and hazardous waste Resource efficiency Sustainable consumption and production \" The six areas are all direct practices to reduce the three factors of the I=PAT equation Al Gores '   documentary film An Inconvenient Truth described the climate change problem and the urgency of solving it The film concluded with Gore saying \"Each one of us is a cause of global warming but each one of us can make choices to change that with the things we buy the electricity we use the cars we drive we can make choices to bring our individual carbon emissions to zero The solutions are in our hands we just have to have the determination to make it happen We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions everything but political will But in America the will to act is a renewable resource \" The four solutions Gore mentions are proper coupling practices There is however a hint of acknowledgement that overcoming systemic change resistance is the real challenge when Gore says we just have to have the determination to make it happen We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions everything but political will The twenty-seven solutions that appear during the film s closing credits are mostly proper coupling solutions The first nine are   Go to www climatecrisis net You can reduce your carbon emissions In fact you can even reduce your carbon emissions to zero Buy energy efficient appliances & light bulbs Change your thermostat and use clock thermostats to reduce energy for heating & cooling Weatherize your house increase insulation get an energy audit Recycle If you can buy a hybrid car When you can walk or ride a bicycle Where you can use light rail & mass transit Some solutions are attempts to overcome individual change resistance such as Tell your parents not to ruin the world that you will live in If you are a parent join with your children to save the world they will live in Vote for leaders who pledge to solve this crisis Write to congress If they don t listen run for congress Speak up in your community However none of the twenty-seven solutions deal with overcoming systemic change resistance Overcoming systemic change resistance edit Efforts here are sparse because environmentalism is currently not oriented toward treating systemic change resistance as a distinct and separate problem to solve On how to specifically overcome the change resistance subproblem Markvart examined two leading theories that seemed to offer insight into change resistance Panarchy theory and New Institutionalism and concluded that   \" neither theory devotes significant attention to understanding the dynamics of resilient and resistant but inefficient and/or unproductive institutional and ecological systems Overall more research is required \" Taking a root cause analysis and system dynamics modeling approach Harich carefully defined the three characteristics of a root cause and then found a main systemic root cause for both the change resistance and proper coupling subproblems   Several sample solution elements for resolving the root causes were suggested The point was made that the exact solution policies chosen do not matter nearly as much as finding the correct systemic root causes Once these are found how to resolve them is relatively obvious because once a root cause is found by structural modeling the high leverage point for resolving it follows easily Solutions may then push on specific structural points in the social system which due to careful modeling will have fairly predictable effects This reaffirms the work of Donella Meadows as expressed in her classic essay on Leverage Points Places to Intervene in a System The final page stated that \"The higher the leverage point the more the system will resist changing it \" Here Meadows refers to the leverage point for resolving the proper coupling subproblem rather than the leverage point for overcoming change resistance This is because the current focus of environmentalism is on proper coupling However if the leverage points associated with the root causes of change resistance exist and can be found the system will not resist changing them This is an important principle of social system behavior For example Harich found the main root cause of successful systemic change resistance to be high \"deception effectiveness \" The source was special interests particularly large for-profit corporations The high leverage point was raising \"general ability to detect manipulative deception \" This can be done with a variety of solution elements such as \"The Truth Test \" This effectively increases truth literacy just as conventional education raises reading and writing literacy Few citizens resist literacy education because its benefits have become so obvious Promotion of corporate social responsibility CSR has been used to try to overcome change resistance to solving social problems including environmental sustainability This solution strategy has not worked well because it is voluntary and does not resolve root causes Milton Friedman explained why CSR fails \"The social responsibility of business is to increase profits \"   Business cannot be responsible to society It can only be responsible to its shareholders"},

measures them against five sets of criteria infrastructure culture and environment healthcare education and stability   Initiatives such as the World Mayor Award seek to highlight what can be done to improve the well-being of cities and communities through good leadership And the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit also known as the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group saw representatives from the world s largest cities and businesses gathering in New York in   to discuss the reduction of carbon emissions in urban areas where three-quarters of global energy consumption occurs     edit The second biennial World Cities Summit WCS   to be held from   June to   July returns with an even larger number of leading international speakers representing diverse cities in the Americas Europe Africa the Middle East and Asia Some of the notable figures include Mr Kamal Nath India s Minister of Road Transport and Highways Mrs Carrie Lam Secretary of Development in Hong Kong SAR Mom Rajawongse Sukhumbhand Paribatra Governor of Bangkok Anna K Tibaijuka Executive Director of UN-HABITAT Haruhiko Kuroda President of the Asian Development Bank and Mr James Adams Vice President of the East Asia and Pacific Region World Bank Some   ministers   governors and mayors and more than   high level experts from Asia the Middle East Europe and the United States have confirmed their attendance thus far These and other speakers will gather in Singapore to address issues on the practical aspects of city governance and integrated approaches to urban development under the Summit s theme of Liveable and Sustainable Cities for the Future Jointly organised by the Centre for Liveable Cities CLC and the Singapore Civil Service College CSC this year s Summit expects over     delegates up from   delegates in   comprising ministers governors mayors senior government officials and business leaders Event highlights include the World Mayors Forum the World Cities Summit Expo several Expert Panel Sessions and various Learning Journeys Despite having the third highest population density in the world Singapore is often rated as one of the world s most liveable cities One such ranking is the Mercer s   Quality of Life survey which identifies Singapore as the highest ranking Asian city among   cities globally and the highest ranking city worldwide for city infrastructure As host nation of the biennial Summit Singapore is well placed to share its expertise in specific areas such as public housing waste management green infrastructure and urban planning The World Cities Summit commenced with high-level plenary sessions which explore the theme of Liveable and Sustainable Cities for the Future in different dimensions Attended by ministers and senior policy makers business leaders practitioners and futurists the plenary sessions will deal with cross-cutting issues around the interplay of people technologies and markets facing cities today with specific emphasis on leadership and governance sustainable and eco-friendly cities as well as harmonious and sustainable communities Complementing the plenary discussions there will be a series of high-level Expert Panel Sessions for government representatives policy makers and specific industry experts to discuss the challenges and solutions faced by cities around the world in greater details covering areas of urban planning infrastructure financing public housing built environment waste management climate change and urban biodiversity The World Mayors' Forum is a gathering of mayors to discuss solutions to the common urban challenges The forum will provide practical recommendations for joint actions where Mayors and city officials can work together to make their cities a better place - more liveable with healthier citizens better housing and better education The World Cities Summit Expo   June to   July   themed Liveable and Sustainable Cities for the Future is a new platform to showcase model cities and innovative urban solutions that enhance economic value whilst addressing environmental challenges     trade visitors are expected to attend the Expo The Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize is a biennial award to recognise individuals and organisations that have made outstanding contributions to the creation of vibrant liveable and sustainable urban communities around the world It seeks to recognise individuals and organisations responsible for urban initiatives that display foresight good governance or innovation in tackling the many urban challenges faced by cities These urban initiatives should incorporate principles of sustainable development and demonstrate an ability to bring social economic and environmental benefits in holistic way to communities around the world The Prize will also place an emphasis on practical and cost effective solutions and ideas that can be easily replicated across cities The inaugural Lee Kuan Yew World Cities is co-organised by the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore URA and Centre for Liveable Cities CLC   Learning Journeys are site visits that provide first-hand perspectives on how policies and ideas can be implemented successfully Hosted by diverse public sector agencies in Singapore these visits will give a behind-the-scenes look at specific projects while providing unique practical learning experiences for delegates Networking Forums are country-led forums with eminent speakers from across the globe Speakers comprise representatives from government trade and research organisations key technology providers financial institutions and urban authorities They will share a myriad of areas including city management development projects and opportunities in the global urban sector Global demographic trends indicate that the degree of urbanisation will increase and that more people will live in cities Already in   more than half of the world s population lived in cities   Biodiversity will play an increasingly important role within the urban landscape Singapore though being a highly urbanised island-city-state still manages to retain a surprisingly rich array of biodiversity by virtue of its geographical location within a biodiversity hotspot Therefore Singapore is well suited and equipped with relevant expertise to establish a cities' biodiversity index Hence Singapore's Minister for National Development Mr Mah Bow Tan proposed the establishment of an index to measure biodiversity in cities at the 9th Meeting of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Bonn Germany in May     To lay out the details for the index the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the National Parks Board of Singapore jointly organised a Technical Expert Workshop on The Singapore Index on Cities' Biodiversity   technical experts on biodiversity indicators as well as city executives responsible for implementation and management of biodiversity and urban projects attended the workshop The Singapore Index on Cities' Biodiversity would measure performance and assign scores based on three categories   Biodiversity - the number of plant animal and other species that exist in a city The services that these plants and animals provide such as pollination and as carbon sinks How well a city manages its biodiversity - for instance by setting up a conservation agency or a museum to document species and habitats The Index will be presented for endorsement during the 10th Meeting of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Nagoya Japan in October   A User s Manual for the Singapore Index on Cities Biodiversity is available online More information about biodiversity conservation in Singapore is available from the National Biodiversity Centre   edit Suzhou won the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize in   for its transformation over the prior two decades including transitioning to a service economy cultural conservation during

carrying produce A grocery store displaying a sign for food miles Food miles is a term which refers to the distance food is transported from the time of its production until it reaches the consumer Food miles are one factor used when assessing the environmental impact of food including the impact on global warming   The concept of food miles originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom It was conceived by Professor Tim Lang   at the Sustainable Agriculture Food and Environment SAFE Alliance   and first appeared in print in a report The Food Miles Report The dangers of long-distance food transport researched and written by Angela Paxton     Some scholars believe that an increase in the distance food travels is due to the globalization of trade the focus of food supply bases into fewer larger districts drastic changes in delivery patterns the increase in processed and packaged foods and making fewer trips to the supermarket These make a small part of the greenhouse gas emissions created by food 83% of overall emissions of CO   are in production phases   Several studies compare emissions over the entire food cycle including production consumption and transport   These include estimates of food-related emissions of greenhouse gas 'up to the farm gate' versus 'beyond the farm gate' In the UK for example agricultural-related emissions may account for approximately 40% of the overall food chain including retail packaging fertilizer manufacture and other factors whereas greenhouse gases emitted in transport account for around 12% of overall food-chain emissions   Researchers are currently working to provide the public with more information The concept of \"food miles\" has been criticised and food miles are not always correlated with the actual environmental impact of food production In comparison the percentage of total energy used in home food preparation is 26% and in food processing is 29% far greater than transportation   Contents   Overview   Food miles in business   Calculating food miles   Criticism     Fair trade     Energy used in production as well as transport     Livestock production as a source of greenhouse gases     \"Local\" food miles     Lifecycle analysis rather than food miles   References     Overview edit The concept of food miles is part of the broader issue of sustainability which deals with a large range of environmental social and economic issues including local food The term was coined by Tim Lang now Professor of Food Policy City University London who says \"The point was to highlight the hidden ecological social and economic consequences of food production to consumers in a simple way one which had objective reality but also connotations \"   The increased distance traveled by food in developed countries was caused by the globilization of food trade which increased by   times since     Food that is transported by road produces more carbon emissions than any other form of transported food Road transport produces 60% of the world's food transport carbon emissions Air transport produces 20% of the world's food transport carbon emissions Rail and sea transport produce 10% each of the world's food transport carbon emissions Although it was never intended as a complete measure of environmental impact it has come under attack as an ineffective means of finding the true environmental impact For example a DEFRA report in   undertaken by researchers at AEA Technology Environment entitled The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development included findings that \"the direct environmental social and economic costs of food transport are over   billion each year and are dominated by congestion \"   The report also indicates that it is not only how far the food has travelled but the method of travel in all parts of the food chain that is important to consider Many trips by personal cars to shopping centres would have a negative environmental impact compared to transporting a few truckloads to neighbourhood stores that can be easily reached by walking or cycling More emissions are created by the drive to the supermarket to buy air freighted food than was created by the air freighting in the first place   Also the positive environmental effects of organic farming may be compromised by increased transportation unless it is produced by local farms The Carbon Trust notes that to understand the carbon emissions from food production all the carbon-emitting processes that occur as a result of getting food from the field to our plates need to be considered including production origin seasonality and home care   Food miles in business edit A recent study led by Professor Miguel Gomez Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University and supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future found that in many instances the supermarket supply chain did much better in terms of food miles and fuel consumption for each pound compared to farmers markets It suggests that selling local foods through supermarkets may be more economically viable and sustainable than through farmers markets   Calculating food miles edit With processed foods that are made of many different ingredients it is very complicated though not impossible to calculate the CO2 emissions from transport by multiplying the distance travelled of each ingredient by the carbon intensity of the mode of transport air road or rail However as both Prof Lang and the original Food Miles report noted the resulting number although interesting cannot give the whole picture of how sustainable or not a food product is   Wal-Mart publicized a press releasing that stated food traveled   miles before it reaches customers The shocking statistics aroused public concern about food miles According to Jane Black a food writer who covers food politics the number was derived from a small database The   terminal markets from which the data was collected handled 30% of the United States produce   Criticism edit Fair trade edit According to Oxfam researchers there are many other aspects of the agricultural processing and the food supply chain that also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions which are not taken into account by simple \"food miles\" measurements     There are benefits to be gained by improving livelihoods in poor countries through agricultural development Smallholder farmers in poor countries can often improve their income and standard of living if they can sell to distant export markets for higher value horticultural produce moving away from the subsistence agriculture of producing staple crops for their own consumption or local markets   However exports from poor countries do not always benefit poor people Unless the product has a Fairtrade label or a label from another robust and independent scheme food exports might make a bad situation worse Only a very small percentage of what importers pay will end up in the hands of plantation workers   Wages are often very low and working conditions bad and sometimes dangerous Sometimes the food grown for export takes up land that had been used to grow food for local consumption so local people can go hungry   Energy used in production as well as transport edit Researchers say a more complete environmental assessment of food that consumers buy needs to take into account how the food has been produced and what energy is used in its production A recent DEFRA case study indicated that tomatoes grown in Spain and transported to the United Kingdom may have a lower carbon footprint in terms of energy than heated greenhouses in the United Kingdom   According to German researchers the food miles concept misleads consumers because the size of transportation and production units is not taken into account Using the methodology of Life Cycle Assessment LCA in accordance with ISO   entire supply chains providing German consumers with food were investigated comparing local food with food of European and global provenance Large-scale agriculture reduces unit costs associated with food production and transportation leading to increased efficiency and decreased energy use per kilogram of food by economies of scale Research from the Justus Liebig University Giessen show that small food production operations may cause even more environmental impact than bigger operations in terms of energy use per kilogram even though food miles are lower Case studies of lamb beef wine apples fruit juices and pork show that the concept of food miles is too simple to account for all factors of food production       A   research report from the Agribusiness and Economics Research Unit at Lincoln University New Zealand counters claims about food miles by comparing total energy used in food production in Europe and New Zealand taking into account energy used to ship the food to Europe for consumers     The report states \"New Zealand has greater production efficiency in many food commodities compared to the UK For example New Zealand agriculture tends to apply fewer fertilizers which require large amounts of energy to produce and cause significant CO2 emissions and animals are able to graze year round outside eating grass instead of large quantities of brought-in feed such as concentrates In the case of dairy and sheep meat production NZ is by far more energy efficient even including the transport cost than the UK twice as efficient in the case of dairy and four times as efficient in case of sheep meat   In the case of apples NZ is more energy-efficient even though the energy embodied in capital items and other inputs data was not available for the UK \" Other researchers have contested the claims from New Zealand Professor Gareth Edwards-Jones has said that the arguments in favour of New Zealand apples shipped to the UK is probably true only or about two months a year during July and August when the carbon footprint for locally grown fruit doubles because it comes out of cool stores   Studies by Dr Christopher Weber et al of the total carbon footprint of food production in the U S have shown transportation to be of minor importance compared to the carbon emissions resulting from pesticide and fertilizer production and the fuel required by farm and food processing equipment   Livestock production as a source of greenhouse gases edit Farm animals account for between 20% and 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions       That figure includes the clearing of land to feed and graze the animals Clearing land of trees and cultivation are the main drivers of farming emissions Deforestation eliminates carbon sinks accelerating the process of climate change Cultivation including the use of synthetic fertilisers releases greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide Nitrogen fertiliser is especially demanding of fossil fuels as producing a tonne of it takes     tonnes of oil   Meanwhile it s increasingly recognised that meat and dairy are the largest sources of food-related emissions The UK s consumption of meat and dairy products including imports accounts for about 8% of national greenhouse gas emissions related to consumption   According to a study by engineers Christopher Weber and H Scott Matthews of Carnegie Mellon University of all the greenhouse gases emitted by the food industry only 4% comes from transporting the food from producers to retailers The study also concluded that adopting a vegetarian diet even if the vegetarian food is transported over very long distances does far more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than does eating a locally grown diet   They also concluded that \"Shifting less than one day per week s worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken fish eggs or a vegetable-based diet achieves more GHG reduction than buying all locally sourced food \" In other words the amount of red meat consumption is much more important than food miles \"Local\" food miles edit A commonly ignored element is the last mile For example a gallon of gasoline could transport   kg of meat over     miles     km by road   tonner at   mpg in bulk transport or it could transport a single consumer only   or   miles   km to buy that meat Thus foods from a distant farm that are transported in bulk to a nearby store consumer can have a lower footprint than foods a consumer picks up directly from a farm that is within driving distance but farther away than the store This can mean that doorstep deliveries of food by companies can lead to lower carbon emissions or energy use than normal shopping practices   Relative distances and mode of transportation make this calculation complicated For example consumers can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the last mile by walking bicycling or taking public transport Another impact is that goods being transported by large ships very long distances can have lower associated carbon emissions or energy use than the same goods traveling by truck a much shorter distance   Lifecycle analysis rather than food miles edit Lifecycle analysis a technique that meshes together a wide range of different environmental criteria including emissions and waste is a more holistic way of assessing the real environmental impact of the food we eat The technique accounts for energy input and output involved in the production processing packaging and transport of food It also factors in resource depletion air pollution and water pollution and waste generation/ municipal solid waste   A number of organisations are developing ways of calculating the carbon cost or lifecycle impact of food and agriculture   Some are more robust than others but at the moment there is no easy way to tell which ones are thorough independent and reliable and which ones are just marketing hype Even a full lifecycle analysis accounts only for the environmental effects of food production and consumption However it is one of the widely agreed three pillars of sustainable development namely environmental social and economic  "},

poll by Ipsos Global @dvisor   Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale such as sunlight wind rain tides waves and geothermal heat   Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas electricity generation air and water heating / cooling transportation and rural off-grid energy services   Based on REN21 's   report renewables contributed   3% to humans' global energy consumption and   5% to their generation of electricity in   and   respectively This energy consumption is divided as   9% coming from traditional biomass   2% as heat energy modern biomass geothermal and solar heat   9% hydro electricity and   2% is electricity from wind solar geothermal and biomass Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US$286 billion in   with countries like China and the United States heavily investing in wind hydro solar and biofuels   Globally there are an estimated     million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries with solar photovoltaics being the largest renewable employer   As of   worldwide more than half of all new electricity capacity installed was renewable   Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas in contrast to other energy sources which are concentrated in a limited number of countries Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security climate change mitigation and economic benefits   The results of a recent review of the literature   concluded that as greenhouse gas GHG emitters begin to be held liable for damages resulting from GHG emissions resulting in climate change a high value for liability mitigation would provide powerful incentives for deployment of renewable energy technologies In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power   At the national level at least   nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than   percent of energy supply National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond   Some places and at least two countries Iceland and Norway generate all their electricity using renewable energy already and many other countries have the set a goal to reach 100% renewable energy in the future For example in Denmark the government decided to switch the total energy supply electricity mobility and heating/cooling to 100% renewable energy by     While many renewable energy projects are large-scale renewable technologies are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries where energy is often crucial in human development   Former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity   As most of renewables provide electricity renewable energy deployment is often applied in conjunction with further electrification which has several benefits Electricity can be converted to heat where necessary generating higher temperatures than fossil fuels can be converted into mechanical energy with high efficiency and is clean at the point of consumption     In addition to that electrification with renewable energy is much more efficient and therefore leads to a significant reduction in primary energy requirements because most renewables don't have a steam cycle with high losses fossil power plants usually have losses of   to 65%   Renewable energy systems are rapidly becoming more efficient and cheaper Their share of total energy consumption is increasing Growth in consumption of coal and oil could end by   due to increased

sunlight wind tides plant growth and geothermal heat as the International Energy Agency explains   Renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly In its various forms it derives directly from the sun or from heat generated deep within the earth Included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from solar wind ocean hydropower biomass geothermal resources and biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable resources Renewable energy resources and significant opportunities for energy efficiency exist over wide geographical areas in contrast to other energy sources which are concentrated in a limited number of countries Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency and technological diversification of energy sources would result in significant energy security and economic benefits   It would also reduce environmental pollution such as air pollution caused by burning of fossil fuels and improve public health reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that amount to several hundred billion dollars annually only in the United States   Renewable energy sources that derive their energy from the sun either directly or indirectly such as hydro and wind are expected to be capable of supplying humanity energy for almost another   billion years at which point the predicted increase in heat from the sun is expected to make the surface of the earth too hot for liquid water to exist     Climate change and global warming concerns coupled with high oil prices peak oil and increasing government support are driving increasing renewable energy legislation incentives and commercialization   New government spending regulation and policies helped the industry weather the global financial crisis better than many other sectors   According to a   projection by the International Energy Agency solar power generators may produce most of the world's electricity within   years reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment   As of   small solar PV systems provide electricity to a few million households and micro-hydro configured into mini-grids serves many more Over   million households use biogas made in household-scale digesters for lighting and/or cooking and more than   million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves   United Nations ' Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity   At the national level at least   nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond and some   countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy including a 20% target of all electricity generated for the European Union by   Some countries have much higher long-term policy targets of up to 100% renewables Outside Europe a diverse group of   or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the     time frame that range from 10% to 50%   Renewable energy often displaces conventional fuels in four areas electricity generation hot water / space heating transportation and rural off-grid energy services   Power generation By   renewable energy is projected to equal coal and natural gas electricity generation Several jurisdictions including Denmark Germany the state of South Australia and some US states have achieved high integration of variable renewables For example in   wind power met 42% of electricity demand in Denmark   2% in Portugal and   5% in Uruguay Interconnectors enable countries to balance electricity systems by allowing the import and export of renewable energy Innovative hybrid systems have emerged between countries and regions   Heating Solar water heating makes an important contribution to renewable heat in many countries most notably in China which now has 70% of the global total   GWth Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated     million households in China Worldwide total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over   million households The use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well In Sweden national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil Direct geothermal for heating is also growing rapidly   The newest addition to Heating is from Geothermal Heat Pumps which provide both heating and cooling and also flatten the electric demand curve and are thus an increasing national priority     see also Renewable thermal energy Transportation A bus fueled by biodiesel Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as corn sugarcane or sweet sorghum Cellulosic biomass derived from non-food sources such as trees and grasses is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions Bioethanol is widely used in the USA and in Brazil Biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe A solar vehicle is an electric vehicle powered completely or significantly by direct solar energy Usually photovoltaic PV cells contained in solar panels convert the sun 's energy directly into electric energy The term \"solar vehicle\" usually implies that solar energy is used to power all or part of a vehicle's propulsion Solar power may be also used to provide power for communications or controls or other auxiliary functions Solar vehicles are not sold as practical day-to-day transportation devices at present but are primarily demonstration vehicles and engineering exercises often sponsored by government agencies However indirectly solar-charged vehicles are widespread and solar boats are available commercially History Prior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century nearly all energy used was renewable Almost without a doubt the oldest known use of renewable energy in the form of traditional biomass to fuel fires dates from     years ago Use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later sometime between     and     years ago   Probably the second oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water This practice can be traced back some   years to ships in the Persian Gulf   and on the Nile   Moving into the time of recorded history the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human labor animal power water power wind in grain crushing windmills   and firewood a traditional biomass A graph of energy use in the United States up until   shows oil and natural gas with about the same importance in   as wind and solar played in   In the 1860s and '70s there were already fears that civilization would run out of fossil fuels and the need was felt for a better source In   Professor Augustin Mouchot wrote   The time will arrive when the industry of Europe will cease to find those natural resources so necessary for it Petroleum springs and coal mines are not inexhaustible but are rapidly diminishing in many places Will man then return to the power of water and wind? Or will he emigrate where the most powerful source of heat sends its rays to all? History will show what will come   In   Werner von Siemens commenting on the discovery of the photovoltaic effect in the solid state wrote In conclusion I would say that however great the scientific importance of this discovery may be its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost and that it will continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten   Max Weber mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs of his Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus published in     Development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of World War I The importance of solar energy was recognized in a   Scientific American article \"in the far distant future natural fuels having been exhausted solar power will remain as the only means of existence of the human race\"   The theory of peak oil was published in     In the 1970s environmentalists promoted the development of renewable energy both as a replacement for the eventual depletion of oil as well as for an escape from dependence on oil and the first electricity generating wind turbines appeared Solar had long been used for heating and cooling but solar panels were too costly to build solar farms until     The IEA   World Energy Outlook projects a growth of renewable energy supply from     gigawatts in   to     gigawatts in   Fossil fuels received about $550 billion in subsidies in   compared to $120 billion for all renewable energies   Mainstream technologies Wind power   Wind power The   MW Shepherds Flat Wind Farm near Arlington Oregon USA Airflows can be used to run wind turbines Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around   kW to   MW of rated power although turbines with rated output of       MW have become the most common for commercial use The largest generator capacity of a single installed onshore wind turbine reached     MW in   The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed so as wind speed increases power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine   Areas where winds are stronger and more constant such as offshore and high altitude sites are preferred locations for wind farms Typically full load hours of wind turbines vary between   and   percent annually but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites   Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in   with nearly   GW of new wind power capacity installed Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe the US and Canada and the second largest in China In Denmark wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20% Globally the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production or   times current electricity demand assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas particularly in areas of higher wind resources such as offshore As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land so offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land stationed turbines   In   global wind generation was   terawatt-hours or 3% of the worlds total electricity   Hydropower Main articles Hydroelectricity and Hydropower The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in China In   hydropower generated   6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity   Since water is about   times denser than air even a slow flowing stream of water or moderate sea swell can yield considerable amounts of energy There are many forms of water energy Historically hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and reservoirs which are still popular in third world countries The largest of which is the Three Gorges Dam   in China and the Itaipu Dam   built by Brazil and Paraguay Small hydro systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to   MW of power They are often used on small rivers or as a low impact development on larger rivers China is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than     small hydro installations   Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity plants derive kinetic energy from rivers without the creation of a large reservoir This style of generation may still produce a large amount of electricity such as the Chief Joseph Dam on the Columbia river in the United States Hydropower is produced in   countries with the Asia-Pacific region generating   percent of global hydropower in   For countries having the largest percentage of electricity from renewables the top   are primarily hydroelectric China is the largest hydroelectricity producer with   terawatt-hours of production in   representing around   percent of domestic electricity use There are now three hydroelectricity stations larger than   GW the Three Gorges Dam in China Itaipu Dam across the Brazil/Paraguay border and Guri Dam in Venezuela   Wave power which captures the energy of ocean surface waves and tidal power converting the energy of tides are two forms of hydropower with future potential however they are not yet widely employed commercially A demonstration project operated by the Ocean Renewable Power Company on the coast of Maine and connected to the grid harnesses tidal power from the Bay of Fundy location of world's

radiant light and heat from the sun is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating photovoltaics concentrated solar power CSP concentrator photovoltaics CPV solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis     Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture convert and distribute solar energy Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties and designing spaces that naturally circulate air Active solar technologies encompass solar thermal energy using solar collectors for heating and solar power converting sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics PV or indirectly using concentrated solar power CSP A photovoltaic system converts light into electrical direct current DC by taking advantage of the photoelectric effect   Solar PV has turned into a multi-billion fast-growing industry continues to improve its cost-effectiveness and has the most potential of any renewable technologies together with CSP     Concentrated solar power CSP systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s CSP-Stirling has by far the highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies In   the International Energy Agency said that \"the development of affordable inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits It will increase countries' energy security through reliance on an indigenous inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource enhance sustainability reduce pollution lower the costs of mitigating climate change and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise These advantages are global Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared\"   Italy has the largest proportion of solar electricity in the world in   solar supplied   8% of electricity

Steam rising from the Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station in Iceland High Temperature Geothermal energy is from thermal energy generated and stored in the Earth Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter Earth's geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of minerals in currently uncertain   but possibly roughly equal   proportions The geothermal gradient which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots geo meaning earth and thermos meaning heat The heat that is used for geothermal energy can be from deep within the Earth all the way down to Earth's core     miles     km down At the core temperatures may reach over     F     C Heat conducts from the core to surrounding rock Extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt which is commonly known as magma Magma convects upward since it is lighter than the solid rock This magma then heats rock and water in the crust sometimes up to   F   C   From hot springs geothermal energy has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient Roman times but it is now better known for electricity generation   Low Temperature Geothermal   refers to the use of the outer crust of the earth as a Thermal Battery to facilitate Renewable thermal energy for heating and cooling buildings and other refrigeration and industrial uses In this form of Geothermal a Geothermal Heat Pump and Ground-coupled heat exchanger are used together to move heat energy into the earth for cooling and out of the earth for heating on a varying seasonal basis Low temperature Geothermal generally referred to as \"GHP\" is an increasingly important renewable technology because it both reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling and it also flattens the electric demand curve eliminating the extreme summer and winter peak electric supply requirements Thus Low Temperature Geothermal/GHP is becoming an increasing national priority with multiple tax credit support   and focus as part of the ongoing movement toward Net Zero Energy     New York City has even just passed a law   to require GHP anytime is shown to be economical with   year financing including the Socialized Cost of Carbon     Bio energy Main articles Bioenergy Biomass Biogas and Biofuel Sugarcane plantation to produce ethanol in Brazil A CHP power station using wood to supply     households in France Biomass is biological material derived from living or recently living organisms It most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass   As an energy source biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into thermal chemical and biochemical methods Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today   examples include forest residues such as dead trees branches and tree stumps yard clippings wood chips and even municipal solid waste In the second sense biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial chemicals including biofuels Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants including miscanthus switchgrass hemp corn poplar willow sorghum sugarcane bamboo   and a variety of tree species ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm palm oil Plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy Some examples of these plants are wheat which typically yield       tonnes of grain per hectare and straw which typically yield       tonnes per hectare in the UK   The grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity Plant biomass can also be degraded from cellulose to glucose through a series of chemical treatments and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first generation biofuel Biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel Rotting garbage and agricultural and human waste all release methane gas also called landfill gas or biogas Crops such as corn and sugarcane can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel ethanol Biodiesel another transportation fuel can be produced from left-over food products like vegetable oils and animal fats   Also biomass to liquids BTLs and cellulosic ethanol are still under research     There is a great deal of research involving algal fuel or algae-derived biomass due to the fact that it's a non-food resource and can be produced at rates   to   times those of other types of land-based agriculture such as corn and soy Once harvested it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol butanol and methane as well as biodiesel and hydrogen The biomass used for electricity generation varies by region Forest by-products such as wood residues are common in the United States Agricultural waste is common in Mauritius sugar cane residue and Southeast Asia rice husks Animal husbandry residues such as poultry litter are common in the United Kingdom   Biofuels include a wide range of fuels which are derived from biomass The term covers solid liquid and gaseous fuels   Liquid biofuels include bioalcohols such as bioethanol and oils such as biodiesel Gaseous biofuels include biogas landfill gas and synthetic gas Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermenting the sugar components of plant materials and it is made mostly from sugar and starch crops These include maize sugarcane and more recently sweet sorghum The latter crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions and is being investigated by International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics for its potential to provide fuel along with food and animal feed in arid parts of Asia and Africa   With advanced technology being developed cellulosic biomass such as trees and grasses are also used as feedstocks for ethanol production Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions Bioethanol is widely used in the United States and in Brazil The energy costs for producing bio-ethanol are almost equal to the energy yields from bio-ethanol However according to the European Environment Agency biofuels do not address global warming concerns   Biodiesel is made from vegetable oils animal fats or recycled greases It can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form or more commonly as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe Biofuels provided   7% of the world's transport fuel in     Biomass biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat/power and in doing so harm the environment Pollutants such as sulphurous oxides SO x nitrous oxides NO x and particulate matter PM are produced from the combustion of biomass the World Health Organisation estimates that   million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution   Biomass combustion is a major contributor       Energy storage Main articles Energy storage and Grid energy storage Energy storage is a collection of methods used to store electrical energy on an electrical power grid or off it Electrical energy is stored during times when production especially from intermittent power plants such as renewable electricity sources such as wind power tidal power solar power exceeds consumption and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption Pumped-storage hydroelectricity is used for more than 90% of all grid power storage Costs of lithium ion batteries are dropping rapidly and are increasingly being deployed as fast acting sources of grid power i e operating reserve and for domestic storage Market and industry trends   Renewable energy

energy use the growth of renewable energy is shown by the green line   From the end of   worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of   60% annually for many technologies In   global investment in renewables rose 5% to $285   billion breaking the previous record of $278   billion in     was also the first year that saw renewables excluding large hydro account for the majority of all new power capacity   GW making up   6% of the total Of the renewables total wind accounted for   GW and solar photovoltaics   GW both record-breaking numbers and sharply up from   figures   GW and   GW respectively In financial terms solar made up 56% of total new investment and wind accounted for 38% Projections vary The EIA has predicted that almost two thirds of net additions to power capacity will come from renewables by   due to the combined policy benefits of local pollution decarbonisation and energy diversification Some studies have set out roadmaps to power 100% of the world s energy with wind hydroelectric and solar by the year   According to a   projection by the International Energy Agency solar power generators may produce most of the world's electricity within   years reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment Cedric Philibert senior analyst in the renewable energy division at the IEA said \"Photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world's demand for electricity by   and half of all energy needs with wind hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation\" \"Photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity\" Philibert said   In   global wind power capacity expanded 16% to     MW   Yearly wind energy production is also growing rapidly and has reached around 4% of worldwide electricity usage     4% in the EU   and it is widely used in Asia and the United States In   worldwide installed photovoltaics capacity increased to   gigawatts GW sufficient to supply   percent of global electricity demands   Solar thermal energy stations operate in the USA and Spain and as of   the largest of these is the   MW Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating

Projection of levelized cost for wind in the U S left and solar power in Europe     Renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition A   IEA report said \"A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support \" and added that \"cost reductions in critical technologies such as wind and solar are set to continue \"   Hydro-electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity Renewable energy costs continue to drop and the levelised cost of electricity LCOE is declining for wind power solar photovoltaic PV concentrated solar power CSP and some biomass technologies   Renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources As the cost of renewable power falls the scope of economically viable applications increases Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity Where \"oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source e g on islands off-grid and in some countries a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today\"   A series of studies by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory modeled the \"grid in the Western US under a number of different scenarios where intermittent renewables accounted for   percent of the total power \" In the models inefficiencies in cycling the fossil fuel plants to compensate for the variation in solar and wind energy resulted in an additional cost of \"between $0   and $1   to each MegaWatt hour generated\" however the savings in the cost of the fuels saved \"adds up to $7 billion meaning the added costs are at most two percent of the savings \"   Hydroelectricity Only a quarter of the worlds estimated hydroelectric potential of     TWh/year has been developed the regional potentials for the growth of hydropower around the world are 71% Europe 75% North America 79% South America 95% Africa 95% Middle East 82% Asia Pacific However the political realities of new reservoirs in western countries economic limitations in the third world and the lack of a transmission system in undeveloped areas result in the possibility of developing 25% of the remaining potential before   with the bulk of that being in the Asia Pacific area   There is slow growth taking place in Western counties but not in the conventional dam and reservoir style of the past New projects take the form of run-of-the-river and small hydro neither using large reservoirs It is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid   Where circumstances permit existing dams like the Russell Dam built in   may be updated with

Photovoltaics PV uses solar cells assembled into solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity It's a fast-growing technology doubling its worldwide installed capacity every couple of years PV systems range from small residential and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations to large utility-scale photovoltaic power station The predominant PV technology is crystalline silicon while thin-film solar cell technology accounts for about   percent of global photovoltaic deployment In recent years PV technology has improved its electricity generating efficiency reduced the installation cost per watt as well as its energy payback time and has reached grid parity in at least   different markets by     Financial institutions are predicting a second solar \"gold rush\" in the near future       At the end of   worldwide PV capacity reached at least     megawatts Photovoltaics grew fastest in China followed by Japan and the United States while Germany remains the world's largest overall producer of photovoltaic power contributing about     percent to the overall electricity generation Italy meets     percent of its electricity demands with photovoltaic power the

power stations Solar panels at the   MW Topaz Solar Farm Nellis Solar Power Plant photovoltaic power plant in Nevada USA Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s As the cost of solar electricity has fallen the number of grid-connected solar PV systems has grown into the millions and utility-scale solar power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun Many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built mainly in Europe China and the USA   The   MW Solar Star in the United States is the world's largest PV power station Many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than fixed-mounted systems There are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations However when it comes to renewable energy systems and PV it is not just large systems that matter Building-integrated photovoltaics or \"onsite\" PV systems use existing land and structures and generate power close to where it is consumed   Biofuel development   Ethanol fuel Sustainable biofuel and Issues relating to biofuels Brazil produces bioethanol made from sugarcane available throughout the country A typical gas station with dual fuel service is marked \"A\" for alcohol ethanol and \"G\" for gasoline Biofuels provided 3% of the world's transport fuel in     Mandates for blending biofuels exist in   countries at the national level and in   states/provinces   According to the International Energy Agency biofuels have the potential to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by     Since the 1970s Brazil has had an ethanol fuel program which has allowed the country to become the world's second largest producer of ethanol after the United States and the world's largest exporter   Brazil's ethanol fuel program uses modern equipment and cheap sugarcane as feedstock and the residual cane-waste bagasse is used to produce heat and power   There are no longer light vehicles in Brazil running on pure gasoline By the end of   there were     filling stations throughout Brazil with at least one ethanol pump   Unfortunately Operation Car Wash has seriously eroded public trust in oil companies and has implicated several high ranking Brazilian officials Nearly all the gasoline sold in the United States today is mixed with 10% ethanol   and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends Ford Daimler AG and GM are among the automobile companies that sell \"flexible-fuel\" cars trucks and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol By mid-2006 there were approximately   million ethanol compatible vehicles on U S roads   Geothermal development   Geothermal energy in the United States Geothermal plant at The Geysers California USA Geothermal power is cost effective reliable sustainable and environmentally friendly   but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries Recent technological advances have expanded the range and size of viable resources especially for applications such as home heating opening a potential for widespread exploitation Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels As a result geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels The International Geothermal Association IGA has reported that     MW of geothermal power in   countries is online which is expected to generate     GWh of electricity in     This represents a 20% increase in geothermal power online capacity since   IGA projects this will grow to     MW by   due to the large number of projects presently under consideration often in areas previously assumed to have little exploitable resource   In   the United States led the world in geothermal electricity production with     MW of installed capacity from   power plants   the largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at The Geysers a geothermal field in California   The Philippines follows the US as the second highest producer of geothermal power in the world with     MW of capacity online geothermal power makes up approximately 18% of the country's electricity generation   Developing countries   Renewable energy in developing countries Solar cookers use sunlight as energy source for outdoor cooking Renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics and affordable only in the affluent developed world This erroneous view has persisted for many years but   was the first year when investment in non-hydro renewables was higher in developing countries with $156 billion invested mainly in China India and Brazil   Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries In rural and remote areas transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative   Technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power the approximately     billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity Even though they are typically very poor these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene   As of   an estimated   million households get power from small solar PV systems   Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita More than     very small solar panels each producing   to   watts are sold in Kenya annually Some Small Island Developing States SIDS are also turning to solar power to reduce their costs and increase their sustainability   Micro-hydro configured into mini-grids also provide power Over   million households use biogas made in household-scale digesters for lighting and/or cooking and more than   million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves   Clean liquid fuel sourced from renewable feedstocks are used for cooking and lighting in energy-poor areas of the developing world Alcohol fuels ethanol and methanol can be produced sustainably from non-food sugary starchy and cellulostic feedstocks Project Gaia Inc and CleanStar Mozambique are implementing clean cooking programs with liquid ethanol stoves in Ethiopia Kenya Nigeria and Mozambique   Renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to poverty reduction by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking space heating and lighting Renewable energy can also contribute to education by providing electricity to schools   Industry and policy trends   Renewable energy commercialization Global New Investments in Renewable Energy   U S President Barack Obama 's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of   includes more than $70 billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs Leading renewable energy companies include First Solar Gamesa GE Energy Hanwha Q Cells Sharp Solar Siemens SunOpta Suntech Power and Vestas   Many national state and local governments have also created green banks A green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies   Green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy The military has also focused on the use of renewable fuels for military vehicles Unlike fossil fuels renewable fuels can be produced in any country creating a strategic advantage The US military has already committed itself to have 50% of its energy consumption come from alternative sources   The International Renewable Energy Agency IRENA is an intergovernmental organization for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer IRENA was formed on   January   by   countries signing the charter of IRENA   As of March   IRENA has   member states who all are considered as founding members of which   have also ratified the statute   As of     countries have some form of national renewable energy policy target or renewable support policy National targets now exist in at least   countries There is also a wide range of policies at state/provincial and local levels   United Nations' Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity   In October   he \"announced the creation of a high-level group to drum up support for energy access energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy The group is to be co-chaired by Kandeh Yumkella the chair of UN Energy and director general of the UN Industrial Development Organisation and Charles Holliday chairman of Bank of America\"   100% renewable energy   100% renewable energy The incentive to use 100% renewable energy for electricity transport or even total primary energy supply globally has been motivated by global warming and other ecological as well as economic concerns The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated   At the national level at least   nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply Also Professors S Pacala and Robert H Socolow have developed a series of \" stabilization wedges \" that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change and \"renewable energy sources \" in aggregate constitute the largest number of their \"wedges\"   Using 100% renewable energy was first suggested in a Science paper published in   by Danish physicist Bent S rensen   It was followed by several other proposals until in   the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published These were followed by the first detailed 100% scenarios In   a PhD thesis was published by Czisch in which it was shown that in a 100% renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in Europa and North Africa In the same year Danish Energy professor Henrik Lund published a first paper   in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables which was followed by several other papers on the transition to 100% renewable energy in Denmark Since then Lund has been publishing several papers on 100% renewable energy After   publications began to rise steeply covering 100% scenarios for countries in Europa America Australia and other parts of the world   In   Mark Z Jacobson professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and Mark Delucchi published a study on 100% renewable global energy supply in the journal Energy Policy They found producing all new energy with wind power solar power and hydropower by   is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by   Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be \"primarily social and political not technological or economic\" They also found that energy costs with a wind solar water system should be similar to today's energy costs   Similarly in the United States the independent National Research Council has noted that \"sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change energy security and the escalation of energy costs Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States taken collectively can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand \"   The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological According to the   Post Carbon Pathways report which reviewed many international studies the key roadblocks are climate change denial the fossil fuels lobby political inaction unsustainable energy consumption outdated energy infrastructure and financial constraints   Emerging technologies Other renewable energy technologies are still under development and include cellulosic ethanol hot-dry-rock geothermal power and marine energy   These technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research development and demonstration RD&D funding   There are numerous organizations within the academic federal and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy This research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum Most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields   Multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years Two of the most prominent of these labs are Sandia National Laboratories and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL both of which are funded by the United States Department of Energy and supported by various corporate partners   Sandia has a total budget of $2   billion   while NREL has a budget of $375 million   Enhanced geothermal system Enhanced geothermal system see file description for details Enhanced geothermal systems

energy also sometimes referred to as ocean energy refers to the energy carried by ocean waves tides salinity and ocean temperature differences The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy or energy in motion This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes transport and industries The term marine energy encompasses both wave power power from surface waves and tidal power obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water Reverse electrodialysis RED is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose as of   it is being tested at a small scale   kW Offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy as wind power is derived from the wind even if the wind turbines are placed over water The oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world   # Station Country Location Capacity Refs   Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station South Korea       N       E /     N     E /

the purpose of electricity generation Thermoelectric or \"thermovoltaic\" devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current Floating solar arrays Floating solar arrays are PV systems that float on the surface of drinking water reservoirs quarry lakes irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds A small number of such systems exist in France India Japan South Korea the United Kingdom Singapore and the United States           The systems are said to have advantages over photovoltaics on land The cost of land is more expensive and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation Unlike most land-based solar plants floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view They achieve higher efficiencies than PV panels on land because water cools the panels The panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion   In May   the Far Niente Winery in Oakville California pioneered the world's first floatovoltaic system by installing   solar PV modules with a total capacity of   kW onto   pontoons and floating them on the winery's irrigation pond   Utility-scale floating PV farms are starting to be built Kyocera will develop the world's largest a     MW farm on the reservoir above Yamakura Dam in Chiba Prefecture   using     solar panels     Salt-water resistant floating farms are also being constructed for ocean use   The largest so far announced floatovoltaic project is a   MW power station in the Amazon region of Brazil   Solar-assisted heat pump A heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a \"heat sink\" Heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one A solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a heat pump and thermal solar panels in a single integrated system Typically these two technologies are used separately or only placing them in parallel to produce hot water   In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump's evaporator   The goal of this system is to get high COP and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way It is possible to use any type of solar thermal panel sheet and tubes roll-bond heat pipe thermal plates or hybrid mono / polycrystalline thin film in combination with the heat pump The use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows covering a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduce the power consumption and consequently the variable costs of the system Artificial photosynthesis Artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol   Researchers in this field are striving to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis that utilize a wider region of the solar spectrum employ catalytic systems made from abundant inexpensive materials that are robust readily repaired non-toxic stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds i e carbohydrates rather than building and sustaining living cells   However prominent research faces hurdles Sun Catalytix a MIT spin-off stopped scaling up their prototype fuel-cell in   because it offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight   Algae fuels Producing liquid fuels from oil-rich varieties of algae is an ongoing research topic Various microalgae grown in open or closed systems are being tried including some system that can be set up in brownfield and desert lands Solar aircraft In   Solar Impulse   was the first solar-powered aircraft to complete a circumnavigation of the world An electric aircraft is an aircraft that runs on electric motors rather than internal combustion engines with electricity coming from fuel cells solar cells ultracapacitors power beaming   or batteries Currently flying manned electric aircraft are mostly experimental demonstrators though many small unmanned aerial vehicles are powered by batteries Electrically powered model aircraft have been flown since the 1970s with one report in       The first man-carrying electrically powered flights were made in     Between     a manned solar-powered plane Solar Impulse   completed a circumnavigation of the Earth   Solar updraft tower The Solar updraft tower is a renewable-energy power plant for generating electricity from low temperature solar heat Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall chimney tower The resulting convection causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the chimney effect This airflow drives wind turbines placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce electricity Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation and may allow development of other applications such as water extraction or distillation and agriculture or horticulture A more advanced version of a similarly themed technology is the Vortex engine which aims to replace large physical chimneys with a vortex of air created by a shorter less-expensive structure Space-based solar power For either photovoltaic or thermal systems one option is to loft them into space particularly Geosynchronous orbit To be competitive with Earth-based solar power systems the specific mass kg/kW times the cost to loft mass plus the cost of the parts needs to be $2400 or less I e for a parts cost plus rectenna of $1100/kW the product of the $/kg and kg/kW must be $1300/kW or less   Thus for     kg/kW the transport cost cannot exceed $200/kg While that will require a   to one reduction SpaceX is targeting a ten to one reduction Reaction Engines may make a   to one reduction possible Debate Main articles Renewable energy debate Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy and Green job Renewable electricity production from sources such as wind power and solar power is sometimes criticized for being variable or intermittent but is not true for concentrated solar geothermal and biofuels that have continuity In any case the International Energy Agency has stated that deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and through local generation contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks   There have been \"not in my back yard\" NIMBY concerns relating to the visual and other impacts of some wind farms with local residents sometimes fighting or blocking construction   In the USA the Massachusetts Cape Wind project was delayed for years partly because of aesthetic concerns However residents in other areas have been more positive According to a town councilor the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the Ardrossan Wind Farm in Scotland has enhanced the area   A recent UK Government document states that \"projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities This means giving communities both a say and a stake\"   In countries such as Germany and Denmark many renewable projects are owned by communities particularly through cooperative structures and contribute significantly to overall levels of renewable energy deployment     The market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow Climate change concerns and increasing in green jobs coupled with high oil prices peak oil oil wars oil spills promotion of electric vehicles and renewable electricity nuclear disasters and increasing government support are driving increasing renewable energy legislation incentives and commercialization   New government spending regulation and policies helped the industry weather the   economic crisis better than many other sectors     While renewables have been very successful in their ever-growing contribution to electrical power there are no countries dominated by fossil fuels who have a plan to stop and get that power from renwables Only Scotland and Ontario have stopped burning coal largely due to good natural gas supplies In the area of transportation fossil fuels are even more entrenched and solutions harder to find   It's unclear if there are failures with policy or renewable energy but twenty years after the Kyoto Protocol fossil fuels are still our primary energy source and consumption continues to grow   Environmental impact Main articles Renewable Heat Incentive scandal Operation Car Wash and Biomass Environmental damage The ability of biomass and biofuels to contribute to a reduction in CO   emissions is limited because both biomass and biofuels emit large amounts of air pollution when burned and in some cases compete with food supply

edit The three pillars of sustainability   Circles of Sustainability image assessment - Melbourne   Sustainable living is fundamentally the application of sustainability to lifestyle choice and decisions One conception of sustainable living expresses what it means in triple-bottom-line terms as meeting present ecological societal and economical needs without compromising these factors for future generations     Another broader conception describes sustainable living in terms of four interconnected social domains economics ecology politics and culture In the first conception sustainable living can be described as living within the innate carrying capacities defined by these factors In the second or Circles of Sustainability conception sustainable living can be described as negotiating the relationships of needs within limits across all the interconnected domains of social life including consequences for future human generations and non-human species   Sustainable design and sustainable development are critical factors to sustainable living Sustainable design encompasses the development of appropriate technology which is a staple of sustainable living practices   Sustainable development in turn is the use of these technologies in infrastructure Sustainable architecture and agriculture are the most common examples of this practice   History edit   The publication of Living the Good Life by Helen and Scott Nearing marked the beginning of the modern day sustainable living movement The publication paved the way for the \" back-to-the-land movement \" in the late 1960s and early 1970s       The publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson marked another major milestone for the sustainability movement     Donella Meadows wrote the international bestseller The Limits to Growth which reported on a study of long-term global trends in population economics and the environment It sold millions of copies and was translated into   languages     E F Schumacher published a collection of essays on shifting towards sustainable living through the appropriate use of technology in his book Small is Beautiful       The United Nations held a series of conferences which focused on increasing sustainability within societies to conserve the Earth's natural resources The Earth Summit conferences were held in     and       the United Nations published Sustainable Consumption and Production Promoting Climate-Friendly Household Consumption Patterns which promoted sustainable lifestyles in communities and homes   Shelter edit An example of ecological housing On a global scale shelter is associated with about 25% of the greenhouse gas emissions embodied in household purchases and 26% of households' land use   Sustainable homes are built using sustainable methods materials and facilitate green practices enabling a more sustainable lifestyle Their construction and maintenance have neutral impacts on the Earth Often if necessary they are close in proximity to essential services such as grocery stores schools daycares work or public transit making it possible to commit to sustainable transportation choices   Sometimes they are off-the-grid homes that do not require any public energy water or sewer service If not off-the-grid sustainable homes may be linked to a grid supplied by a power plant that is using sustainable power sources buying power as is normal convention Additionally sustainable homes may be connected to a grid but generate their own electricity through renewable means and sell any excess to a utility There are two common methods to approaching this option net metering and double metering   Net metering uses the common meter that is installed in most homes running forward when power is used from the grid and running backward when power is put into the grid which allows them to net out their total energy use putting excess energy into the grid when not needed and using energy from the grid during peak hours when you may not be able to produce enough immediately Power companies can quickly purchase the power that is put back into the grid as it is being produced Double metering involves installing two meters one measuring electricity consumed the other measuring electricity created Additionally or in place of selling their renewable energy sustainable home owners may choose to bank their excess energy by using it to charge batteries This gives them the option to use the power later during less favorable power-generating times i e night-time when there has been no wind etc and to be completely independent of the electrical grid   Sustainably designed see Sustainable Design houses   are generally sited so as to create as little of a negative impact on the surrounding ecosystem as possible oriented to the sun so that it creates the best possible microclimate typically the long axis of the house or building should be oriented east-west and provide natural shading or wind barriers where and when needed among many other considerations The design of a sustainable shelter affords the options it has later i e using passive solar lighting and heating creating temperature buffer zones by adding porches deep overhangs to help create favorable microclimates etc     Sustainably constructed houses involve environmentally friendly management of waste building materials such as recycling and composting use non-toxic and renewable recycled reclaimed or low-impact production materials that have been created and treated in a sustainable fashion such as using organic or water-based finishes use as much locally available materials and tools as possible so as to reduce the need for transportation and use low-impact production methods methods that minimize effects on the environment     Many materials can be considered a green material until its background is revealed Any material that has used toxic or carcinogenic chemicals in its treatment or manufacturing such as formaldehyde in glues used in woodworking has traveled extensively from its source or manufacturer or has been cultivated or harvested in an unsustainable manner might not be considered green In order for any material to be considered green it must be resource efficient not compromise indoor air quality or water conservation and be energy efficient both in processing and when in use in the shelter   Resource efficiency can be achieved by using as much recycled content reusable or recyclable content materials that employ recycled or recyclable packaging locally available material salvaged or remanufactured material material that employs resource efficient manufacturing and long-lasting material as possible   Sustainable building materials edit Some building materials might be considered \"sustainable\" by some definitions and under some conditions For example wood might be thought of as sustainable if it is grown using sustainable forest management processed using sustainable energy delivered by sustainable transport etc Under different conditions however it might not be considered as sustainable The following materials might be considered as sustainable under certain conditions based on a Life-cycle assessment Adobe Bamboo Cellulose insulation Cob Composite wood when made from reclaimed hardwood sawdust and reclaimed or recycled plastic Compressed earth block Cordwood Cork Hemp Insulating concrete forms Lime render Linoleum Lumber from Forest Stewardship Council approved sources Natural Rubber Natural fiber coir wool jute etc Organic cotton insulation Papercrete Rammed earth Reclaimed stone Reclaimed brick Recycled metal Recycled concrete Recycled paper Soy-based adhesive Soy insulation Straw Bale Structural insulated panel Wood Insulation of a sustainable home is important because of the energy it conserves throughout the life of the home Well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or in combination with a house that is well designed eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used Typically lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner For walls that do not have cavities behind them solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install   Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation Simply assuring that windows and doors are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home   Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out     Low-emissivity or Low-E glass is another option for window insulation It is a coating on windowpanes of a thin transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer Simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation   Superwindows mentioned in Natural Capitalism Creating the Next Industrial Revolution became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies including two to three transparent low-e coatings multiple panes of glass and a heavy gas filling Although more expensive they are said to be able to insulate four and a half times better than a typical double-glazed windows   Equipping roofs with highly reflective material such as aluminum increases a roof's albedo and will help reduce the amount of heat it absorbs hence the amount of energy needed to cool the building it is on Green roofs or living roofs are a popular choice for thermally insulating a building They are also popular for their ability to catch storm-water runoff and when in the broader picture of a community reduce the heat island effect see urban heat island thereby reducing energy costs of the entire area It is arguable that they are able to replace the physical footprint that the building creates helping reduce the adverse environmental impacts of the building s presence     Energy efficiency and water conservation are also major considerations in sustainable housing If using appliances computers HVAC systems electronics or lighting the sustainable-minded often look for an Energy Star label which is government-backed and holds stricter regulations in energy and water efficiency than is required by law     Ideally a sustainable shelter should be able to completely run the appliances it uses using renewable energy and should strive to have a neutral impact on the Earth s water sources   Greywater including water from washing machines sinks showers and baths may be reused in landscape irrigation and toilets as a method of water conservation Likewise rainwater harvesting from storm-water runoff is also a sustainable method to conserve water use in a sustainable shelter   Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems replicate the natural systems that clean water in wildlife and implement them in a city s drainage system so as to minimize contaminated water and unnatural rates of runoff into the environment     See related articles in LEED Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Power edit Sustainable urban design and innovation Photovoltaic ombri re SUDI is an autonomous and mobile station that replenishes energy for electric vehicles using solar energy As mentioned under Shelter some sustainable households may choose to produce their own renewable energy while others may choose to purchase it through the grid from a power company that harnesses sustainable sources also mentioned previously are the methods of metering the production and consumption of electricity in a household Purchasing sustainable energy however may simply not be possible in some locations due to its limited availability   out of the   states in the US do not offer green energy for example For those that do its consumers typically buy a fixed amount or a percentage of their monthly consumption from a company of their choice and the bought green energy is fed into the entire national grid Technically in this case the green energy is not being fed directly to the household that buys it   In this case it is possible that the amount of green electricity that the buying household receives is a small fraction of their total incoming electricity This may or may not depend on the amount being purchased The purpose of buying green electricity is to support their utility s effort in producing sustainable energy   Producing sustainable energy on an individual household or community basis is much more flexible but can still be limited in the richness of the sources that the location may afford some locations may not be rich in renewable energy sources while others may have an abundance of it When generating renewable energy and feeding it back into the grid in participating countries such as the US and Germany producing households are typically paid at least the full standard electricity rate by their utility and are also given separate renewable energy credits that they can then sell to their utility additionally utilities are interested in buying these renewable energy credits because it allows them to claim that they produce renewable energy In some special cases producing households may be paid up to four times the standard electricity rate but this is not common   An installation of solar panels in rural Mongolia Solar power harnesses the energy of the sun to make electricity Two typical methods for converting solar energy into electricity are photo-voltaic cells that are organized into panels and concentrated solar power which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight to either heat a fluid that runs an electrical generator via a steam turbine or heat engine or to simply cast onto photo-voltaic cells     The energy created by photo-voltaic cells is a direct current and has to be converted to alternating current before it can be used in a household At this point users can choose to either store this direct current in batteries for later use or use an AC/DC inverter for immediate use To get the best out of a solar panel the angle of incidence of the sun should be between   and   degrees Solar power via photo-voltaic cells are usually the most expensive method to harnessing renewable energy but is falling in price as technology advances and public interest increases It has the advantages of being portable easy to use on an individual basis readily available for government grants and incentives and being flexible regarding location though it is most efficient when used in hot arid areas since they tend to be the most sunny     For those that are lucky affordable rental schemes may be found   Concentrated solar power plants are typically used on more of a community scale rather than an individual household scale because of the amount of energy they are able to harness but can be done on an individual scale with a parabolic reflector     Solar thermal energy is harnessed by collecting direct heat from the sun One of the most common ways that this method is used by households is through solar water heating In a broad perspective these systems involve well insulated tanks for storage and collectors are either passive or active systems active systems have pumps that continuously circulate water through the collectors and storage tank and in active systems involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used Passive systems are cheaper than active systems since they do not require a pumping system instead they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank   Other methods of harnessing solar power are solar space heating for heating internal building spaces solar drying for drying wood chips fruits grains etc solar cookers solar distillers and other passive solar technologies simply harnessing sunlight without any mechanical means Wind power is harnessed through turbines set on tall towers typically   or 6m with   or 3m diameter blades for an individual household s needs that power a generator that creates electricity     They typically require an average of wind speed of   mi/hr   km/hr to be worth their investment as prescribed by the US Department of Energy and are capable of paying for themselves within their lifetimes Wind turbines in urban areas usually need to be mounted at least   10m in the air to receive enough wind and to be void of nearby obstructions such as neighboring buildings Mounting a wind turbine may also require permission from authorities Wind turbines have been criticized for the noise they produce their appearance and the argument that they can affect the migratory patterns of birds their blades obstruct passage in the sky Wind turbines are much more feasible for those living in rural areas   and are one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy per kilowatt approaching the cost of fossil fuels and have quick paybacks   For those that have a body of water flowing at an adequate speed or falling from an adequate height on their property hydroelectricity may be an option On a large scale hydroelectricity in the form of dams has adverse environmental and social impacts When on a small scale however in the form of single turbines hydroelectricity is very sustainable Single water turbines or even a group of single turbines are not environmentally or socially disruptive On an individual household basis single turbines are the probably the only economically feasible route but can have high paybacks and is one of the most efficient methods of renewable energy production It is more common for an eco-village to use this method rather than a singular household   Geothermal energy production involves harnessing the hot water or steam below the earth s surface in reservoirs to produce energy Because the hot water or steam that is used is reinjected back into the reservoir this source is considered sustainable However those that plan on getting their electricity from this source should be aware that there is controversy over the lifespan of each geothermal reservoir as some believe that their lifespans are naturally limited they cool down over time making geothermal energy production there eventually impossible This method is often large scale as the system required to harness geothermal energy can be complex and requires deep drilling equipment There do exist small individual scale geothermal operations however which harness reservoirs very close to the Earth s surface avoiding the need for extensive drilling and sometimes even taking advantage of lakes or ponds where there is already a depression In this case the heat is captured and sent to a geothermal heat pump system located inside the shelter or facility that needs it often this heat is used directly to warm a greenhouse during the colder months   Although geothermal energy is available everywhere on Earth practicality and cost-effectiveness varies directly related to the depth required to reach reservoirs Places such as the Philippines Hawaii Alaska Iceland California and Nevada have geothermal reservoirs closer to the Earth s surface making its production cost-effective   Biomass power is created when any biological matter is burned as fuel As with the case of using green materials in a household it is best to use as much locally available material as possible so as to reduce the carbon footprint created by transportation Although burning biomass for fuel releases carbon dioxide sulfur compounds and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere a major concern in a sustainable lifestyle the amount that is released is sustainable it will not contribute to a rise in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere This is because the biological matter that is being burned releases the same amount of carbon dioxide that it consumed during its lifetime     However burning biodiesel and bioethanol see biofuel when created from virgin material is increasingly controversial and may or may not be considered sustainable because it inadvertently increases global poverty the clearing of more land for new agriculture fields the source of the biofuel is also the same source of food and may use unsustainable growing methods such as the use of environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers       List of organic matter than can be burned for fuel edit Bagasse Biogas Manure Stover Straw Used vegetable oil Wood Digestion of organic material to produce methane is becoming an increasingly popular method of biomass energy production Materials such as waste sludge can be digested to release methane gas that can then be burnt to produce electricity Methane gas is also a natural by-product of landfills full of decomposing waste and can be harnessed here to produce electricity as well The advantage in burning methane gas is that is prevents the methane from being released into the atmosphere exacerbating the greenhouse effect Although this method of biomass energy production is typically large scale done in landfills it can be done on a smaller individual or community scale as well   Food edit Globally food accounts for 48% and 70% of household environmental impacts on land and water resources respectively with consumption of meat dairy and processed food rising quickly with income   Environmental impacts of industrial agriculture edit Industrial agricultural production is highly resource and energy intensive Industrial agriculture systems typically require heavy irrigation extensive pesticide and fertilizer application intensive tillage concentrated monoculture production and other continual inputs As a result of these industrial farming conditions today s mounting environmental stresses are further exacerbated These stresses include declining water tables chemical leaching chemical runoff soil erosion land degradation loss in biodiversity and other ecological concerns   Conventional food distribution and long distance transport edit Conventional food distribution and long distance transport are additionally resource and energy exhaustive Substantial climate-disrupting carbon emissions boosted by the transport of food over long distances are of growing concern as the world faces such global crisis as natural resource depletion peak oil and climate change   The average American meal currently costs about   miles and takes about   calories of oil and other fossil fuels to produce a single calorie of food   Local and seasonal foods edit A more sustainable means of acquiring food is to purchase locally and seasonally Buying food from local farmers reduces carbon output caused by long-distance food transport and stimulates the local economy   Local small-scale farming operations also typically utilize more sustainable methods of agriculture than conventional industrial farming systems such as decreased tillage nutrient cycling fostered biodiversity and reduced chemical pesticide and fertilizer applications   Adapting a more regional seasonally based diet is more sustainable as it entails purchasing less energy and resource demanding produce that naturally grow within a local area and require no long-distance transport These vegetables and fruits are also grown and harvested within their suitable growing season Thus seasonal food farming does not require energy intensive greenhouse production extensive irrigation plastic packaging and long-distance transport from importing non-regional foods and other environmental stressors   Local seasonal produce is typically fresher unprocessed and argued to be more nutritious Local produce also contains less to no chemical residues from applications required for long-distance shipping and handling   Farmers' markets public events where local small-scale farmers gather and sell their produce are a good source for obtaining local food and knowledge about local farming productions As well as promoting localization of food farmers markets are a central gathering place for community interaction   Another way to become involved in regional food distribution is by joining a local community-supported agriculture CSA A CSA consists of a community of growers and consumers who pledge to support a farming operation while equally sharing the risks and benefits of food production CSA's usually involve a system of weekly pick-ups of locally farmed vegetables and fruits sometimes including dairy products meat and special food items such as baked goods   Considering the previously noted rising environmental crisis the United States and much of the world is facing immense vulnerability to famine Local food production ensures food security if potential transportation disruptions and climatic economical and sociopolitical disasters were to occur   Reducing meat consumption edit Industrial meat production also involves high environmental costs such as land degradation soil erosion and depletion of natural resources especially pertaining to water and food   Mass meat production increase the amount of methane in the atmosphere For more information on the environmental impact of meat production and consumption see the ethics of eating meat Reducing meat consumption perhaps to a few meals a week or adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet alleviates the demand for environmentally damaging industrial meat production Buying and consuming organically raised free range or grass fed meat is another alternative towards more sustainable meat consumption   Organic farming edit Purchasing and supporting organic products is another fundamental contribution to sustainable living Organic farming is a rapidly emerging trend in the food industry and in the web of sustainability According to the USDA National Organic Standards Board NOSB organic agriculture is defined as \"an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity biological cycles and soil biological activity It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore maintain or enhance ecological harmony The primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life plants animals and people \" Upon sustaining these goals organic agriculture uses techniques such as crop rotation permaculture compost green manure and biological pest control In addition organic farming prohibits or strictly limits the use of manufactured fertilizers and pesticides plant growth regulators such as hormones livestock antibiotics food additives and genetically modified organisms   Organically farmed products include vegetables fruit grains herbs meat dairy eggs fibers and flowers See organic certification for more information Urban gardening edit \"Edible landscaping\" a vegetable garden incorporated by the local residents into a roadside park Qixia District Nanjing China In addition to local small-scale farms there has been a recent emergence in urban agriculture expanding from community gardens to private home gardens With this trend both farmers and ordinary people are becoming involved in food production A network of urban farming systems helps to further ensure regional food security and encourages self-sufficiency and cooperative interdependence within communities   With every bite of food raised from urban gardens negative environmental impacts are reduced in numerous ways For instance vegetables and fruits raised within small-scale gardens and farms are not grown with tremendous applications of nitrogen fertilizer required for industrial agricultural operations The nitrogen fertilizers cause toxic chemical leaching and runoff that enters our water tables Nitrogen fertilizer also produces nitrous oxide a more damaging greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide Local community-grown food also requires no imported long-distance transport which further depletes our fossil fuel reserves   In developing more efficiency per land acre urban gardens can be started in a wide variety of areas in vacant lots public parks private yards church and school yards on roof tops roof-top gardens and many other places Communities can work together in changing zoning limitations in order for public and private gardens to be permissible   Aesthetically pleasing edible landscaping plants can also be incorporated into city landscaping such as blueberry bushes grapevines trained on an arbor pecan trees etc   With as small a scale as home or community farming sustainable and organic farming methods can easily be utilized Such sustainable organic farming techniques include composting biological pest control crop rotation mulching drip irrigation nutrient cycling and permaculture   For more information on sustainable farming systems see sustainable agriculture Food preservation and storage edit Preserving and storing foods reduces reliance on long-distance transported food and the market industry Home-grown foods can be preserved and stored outside of their growing season and continually consumed throughout the year enhancing self-sufficiency and independence from the supermarket Food can be preserved and saved by dehydration freezing vacuum packing canning bottling pickling and jellying   For more information see food preservation Transportation edit   Sustainable transport A carsharing plug-in hybrid vehicle being used to drop off compost at an urban facility in Chicago With rising peak oil concerns climate warming exacerbated by carbon emissions and high energy prices the conventional automobile industry is becoming less and less feasible to the conversation of sustainability Revisions of urban transport systems that foster mobility low-cost transportation and healthier urban environments are needed Such urban transport systems should consist of a combination of rail transport bus transport bicycle pathways and pedestrian walkways Public transport systems such as underground rail systems and bus transit systems shift huge numbers of people away from reliance on car mobilization and dramatically reduce the rate of carbon emissions caused by automobile transport   Carpooling is another alternative for reducing oil consumption and carbon emissions by transit In comparison to automobiles bicycles are a paragon of energy efficient personal transportation with the bicycle roughly   times more energy efficient than driving   Bicycles increase mobility while alleviating congestion lowering air and noise pollution and increasing physical exercise Most importantly they do not emit climate-disturbing carbon dioxide   Bike-sharing programs are beginning to boom throughout the world and are modeled in leading cities such as Paris Amsterdam and London   Bike-sharing programs offer kiosks and docking stations that supply hundreds to thousands of bikes for rental throughout a city through small deposits or affordable memberships   A recent boom has occurred in electric bikes especially in China and other Asian countries Electric bikes are similar to plug-in hybrid vehicles in that they are battery powered and can be plugged into the provincial electric grid for recharging as needed In contrast to plug-in hybrid cars electric bikes do not directly use any fossil fuels Adequate sustainable urban transportation is dependent upon proper city infrastructure and planning that incorporates efficient public transit along with bicycle and pedestrian-friendly pathways   Patrick Maria Johnson was the founder of this Water edit This article appears to contradict the article Water efficiency Please see discussion on the linked talk page December   Learn how and when to remove this template message   Water efficiency A major factor of sustainable living involves that which no human can live without water Unsustainable water use has far reaching implications for humankind Currently humans use one-fourth of the Earth s total fresh water in natural circulation and over half the accessible runoff   Additionally population growth and water demand is ever increasing Thus it is necessary to use available water more efficiently In sustainable living one can use water more sustainably through a series of simple everyday measures These measures involve considering indoor home appliance efficiency outdoor water use and daily water use awareness Indoor home appliances edit Housing and commercial buildings account for   percent of America s freshwater withdrawals   A typical American single family home uses about   US gallons   L per person per day indoors   This use can be reduced by simple alterations in behavior and upgrades to appliance quality Toilets edit Toilets accounted for almost 30% of residential indoor water use in the United States in     One flush of a standard U S toilet requires more water than most individuals and many families in the world use for all their needs in an entire day   A home s toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet To improve the current toilet one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank Also there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank A float booster attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye but can waste hundreds of gallons each month One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color In the event of a leaky flapper one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush If installing a new toilet there are a number of options to obtain the most water efficient model A low flush toilet uses one to two gallons per flush Traditionally toilets use three to five gallons per flush If an eighteen-liter per flush toilet is removed and a six-liter per flush toilet is put in its place 70% of the water flushed will be saved while the overall indoor water use by will be reduced by 30%   It is possible to have a toilet that uses no water A composting toilet treats human waste through composting and dehydration producing a valuable soil additive   These toilets feature a two-compartment bowl to separate urine from feces The urine can be collected or sold as fertilizer The feces can be dried and bagged or composted These toilets cost scarcely more than regularly installed toilets and do not require a sewer hookup In addition to providing valuable fertilizer these toilets are highly sustainable because they save sewage collection and treatment as well as lessen agricultural costs and improve topsoil Additionally one can reduce toilet water sustainability by limiting total toilet flushing For instance instead of flushing small wastes such as tissues one can dispose of these items in the trash or compost Showers edit On average showers were 18% of U S indoor water use in   at     US gallons     L per minute traditionally in America   A simple method to reduce this use is to switch to low-flow high-performance showerheads These showerheads use only   0-1   gpm or less An alternative to replacing the showerhead is to install a converter This device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature Solar water heaters can be used to obtain optimal water temperature and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels To lessen excess water use water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation This insulation decreases hot water generation time A simple straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers One method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary such as while lathering and resuming the shower when water is necessary This can be facilitated when the plumbing or showerhead allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired temperature setting common in the UK but not the United States Dishwashers and sinks edit On average sinks were 15% of U S indoor water use in     There are however easy methods to rectify excessive water loss Available for purchase is a screw-on aerator This device works by combining water with air thus generating a frothy substance with greater perceived volume reducing water use by half Additionally there is a flip-valve available that allows flow to be turned off and back on at the previously reached temperature Finally a laminar flow device creates a   5-2   gpm stream of water that reduces water use by half but can be turned to normal water level when optimal In addition to buying the above devices one can live more sustainably by checking sinks for leaks and fixing these links if they exist According to the EPA \"A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste   gallons of water per day while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons\"   When washing dishes by hand it is not necessary to leave the water running for rinsing and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously On average dishwashing consumes 1% of indoor water use   When using a dishwasher water can be conserved by only running the machine when it is full Some have a \"low flow\" setting to use less water per wash cycle Enzymatic detergents clean dishes more efficiently and more successfully with a smaller amount of water at a lower temperature citation needed Washing machines edit On average 23% of U S indoor water use in   was due to clothes washing   In contrast to other machines American washing machines have changed little to become more sustainable A typical washing machine has a vertical-axis design in which clothes are agitated in a tubful of water Horizontal-axis machines in contrast put less water into the bottom of the rub and rotate clothes through it These machines are more efficient in terms of soap use and clothing stability Outdoor water use edit There are a number of ways one can incorporate a personal yard roof and garden in more sustainable living While conserving water is a major element of sustainability so is sequestering water Conserving water edit In planning a yard and garden space it is most sustainable to consider the plants soil and available water Drought resistant shrubs plants and grasses require a smaller amount of water in comparison to more traditional species Additionally native plants as opposed to herbaceous perennials will use a smaller supply of water and have a heightened resistance to plant diseases of the area Xeriscaping is a technique that selects drought-tolerant plants and accounts for endemic features such as slope soil type and native plant range It can reduce landscape water use by   70% while providing habitat space for wildlife Plants on slopes help reduce runoff by slowing and absorbing accumulated rainfall Grouping plants by watering needs further reduces water waste After planting placing a circumference of mulch surrounding plants functions to lessen evaporation To do this firmly press two to four inches of organic matter along the plant's dripline This prevents water runoff When watering consider the range of sprinklers watering paved areas is unnecessary Additionally to conserve the maximum amount of water watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation Drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system Drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period These systems use   50% less water than conventional methods   Soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90%   They connect to a garden hose and lay along the row of plants under a layer of mulch A layer of organic material added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention previously planted areas can be covered with compost In caring for a lawn there are a number of measures that can increase the sustainability of lawn maintenance techniques A primary aspect of lawn care is watering To conserve water it is important to only water when necessary and to deep soak when watering Additionally a lawn may be left to go dormant renewing after a dry spell to its original vitality Sequestering water edit A common method of water sequestrations is rainwater harvesting which incorporates the collection and storage of rain Primarily the rain is obtained from a roof and stored on the ground in catchment tanks Water sequestration varies based on extent cost and complexity A simple method involves a single barrel at the bottom of a downspout while a more complex method involves multiple tanks It is highly sustainable to use stored water in place of purified water for activities such as irrigation and flushing toilets Additionally using stored rainwater reduces the amount of runoff pollution picked up from roofs and pavements that would normally enter streams through storm drains The following equation can be used to estimate annual water supply Collection area square feet Rainfall inch/year /   inch/foot = Cubic Feet of Water/Year Cubic Feet/Year     Gallons/Cubic Foot = Gallons/year Note however this calculation does not account for losses such as evaporation or leakage   Greywater systems function in sequestering used indoor water such as laundry bath and sink water and filtering it for reuse Greywater can be reused in irrigation and toilet flushing There are two types of greywater systems gravity fed manual systems and package systems   The manual systems do not require electricity but may require a larger yard space   The package systems require electricity but are self-contained and can be installed indoors   Waste edit As populations and resource demands climb waste production contributes to emissions of carbon dioxide leaching of hazardous materials into the soil and waterways and methane emissions In America alone over the course of a decade   trillion pounds of American resources will have been transformed into nonproductive wastes and gases   Thus a crucial component of sustainable living is being waste conscious One can do this by reducing waste reusing commodities and recycling There are a number of ways to reduce waste in sustainable living Two methods to reduce paper waste are canceling junk mail like credit card and insurance offers and direct mail marketing and changing monthly paper statements to paperless emails Junk mail alone accounted for     million tons of landfill waste in     Another method to reduce waste is to buy in bulk reducing packaging materials Preventing food waste can limit the amount of organic waste sent to landfills producing the powerful greenhouse gas methane   Another example of waste reduction involves being cognizant of purchasing excessive amounts when buying materials with limited use like cans of paint Non-hazardous or less hazardous alternatives can also limit the toxicity of waste   By reusing materials one lives more sustainably by not contributing to the addition of waste to landfills Reusing saves natural resources by decreasing the necessity of raw material extraction For example reusable bags can reduce the amount of waste created by grocery shopping eliminating the need to create and ship plastic bags and the need to manage their disposal and recycling or polluting effects Recycling a process that breaks down used items into raw materials to make new materials is a particularly useful means of contributing to the renewal of goods Recycling incorporates three primary processes collection and processing manufacturing and purchasing recycled products   A natural example of recycling involves using food waste as compost to enrich the quality of soil which can be carried out at home or locally with community composting An offshoot of recycling upcycling strives to convert material into something of similar or greater value in its second life   By integrating measures of reusing reducing and recycling one can effectively reduce personal waste and use materials in a more sustainable

Take a moment to buy yourself a lab on eBay \"   He then set up a garage lab the same year working on a project he had previously worked at the Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley California   In   the DIYbio organization was founded by Jason Bobe and Mackenzie Cowell and its first meeting held   In   Genspace opened the first community biology lab   Ten months later it was followed by BioCurious   and Victoria Makerspace Many other labs and organizations followed including but not limited to Counter Culture Labs in Oakland CA Baltimore Underground Science Space in Baltimore MD TheLab in Los Angeles CA and Denver Biolabs in Denver CO In   the first conference to focus specifically on biohacking was announced to take place in Sept in Oakland CA   Aspects edit The DIYbio movement seeks to revise the notion that one must be an academic with an advanced degree to make any significant contribution to the biology community It allows large numbers of small organizations and individuals to participate in research and development with spreading knowledge a higher priority than turning profits   The motivations for DIY biology include but aren't limited to lowered costs entertainment medicine biohacking life extension and education Recent work combining open-source hardware of microcontrollers like the Arduino and RepRap 3-D printers very low-cost scientific instruments have been developed   Community laboratory space edit Many organizations maintain a laboratory akin to a wet-lab makerspace providing equipment and supplies for members Many organizations also run classes and provide training For a fee usually between $50 and $100 members can join some spaces and do experiments on their own       Open source equipment edit The DIY biology movement attempts to make available the tools and resources necessary for anyone including non-professionals to conduct biological engineering One of the first pieces of open source laboratory equipment developed was the Dremelfuge by Irish biohacker Cathal Garvey which uses a 3D printed tube holder attached to a Dremel rotary tool to spin tubes at high speeds replacing often expensive centrifuges   Many other devices like PCR machines have been recreated extensively       In recent times more complex devices have been created such as the OpenDrop digital microfluidics platform   and the DIY NanoDrop   both developed by GaudiLabs Opentrons makes open-source affordable lab robots and got its start as a DIY biology collaboration at Genspace   Advocacy edit Most advocacy in biohacking is about the safety accessibility and future legality of experimentation Todd Kuiken of the Woodrow Wilson Center proposes that through safety and self-governance DIY biologists won't be in need of regulation   However Josiah Zayner has proposed that safety is inherent in biohacking and that accessibility should be the foremost concern as there is large underrepresentation of social and ethnic minorities in biohacking   Research topics edit Many biohacking projects revolve around the modification of life and molecular and genetic engineering   Bioinformatics edit Bioinformatics is another popular target for do-it-yourself biology research As in other fields many programming languages can be used in DIY biology but most of the languages that are used are those with large bioinformatics libraries Examples include BioPerl or BioPython which use the languages Perl and Python respectively Genetic engineering edit Genetic Engineers are a subculture of biohackers as one of the most accessible forms of biohacking is through engineering microorganisms or plants Experiments can range from using plasmids to fluorescent bacteria controlling gene expression using light in bacteria   even using CRISPR to engineer the genome of bacteria or yeast   Medicine edit Restricted access to medical care and medicine has pushed biohackers to start experimenting in medically related fields The Open Insulin project aims to make the recombinant protein insulin more accessible by creating an open source protocol for expression and purification   Other experiments that have involved medical treatments include a whole body microbiome transplant   and the creation of open source artificial pancreases   for diabetics Implants edit Grinders are a subculture of biohackers that focus on implanting technology   or introducing chemicals   into the body to enhance or change their bodies' functionality Art edit Self-described \" transgenic artist\" Eduardo Kac uses biotechnology and genetics to create works that both utilise and critique scientific techniques In one of his works Alba Kac collaborated with a French laboratory to procure a green-fluorescent rabbit a rabbit implanted with a green fluorescent protein gene from a type of jellyfish in order for the rabbit to fluoresce green under ultraviolet light The members of the Critical Art Ensemble have written books and staged multimedia performance interventions around this issue including The Flesh Machine focusing on in vitro fertilisation surveillance of the body and liberal eugenics and Cult of the New Eve In order to analyze how in their words \"Science is the institution of authority regarding the production of knowledge and tends to replace this particular social function of conventional Christianity in the west\"   Heather Dewey-Hagborg is an information artist and biohacker who uses genomic DNA left behind by people as a starting point for creating lifelike computer-generated 3-D portraits     Criticism and concerns edit Biohacking experiences many of the same criticisms as synthetic biology and genetic engineering already receive plus other concerns relating to the distributed and non-institutional nature of the work involving potential hazards with lack of oversight by professionals or governments Concerns about biohackers creating pathogens in unmonitored garage laboratories led the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI to begin sending its representatives to DIYbio conferences in     The arrest and prosecution of some members for their work with harmless microbes such as artivist Steve Kurtz has been denounced as political repression by critics who argue the U S government has used post-9/11 anti-terrorism powers to intimidate artists and others who use their art to criticize society   Existing regulations are not specific to this field so that the possibility of pathological organisms being created and released unintentionally or intentionally by biohackers has become a matter of concern for example in the spirit of the re-creation of the   flu virus by Armed Forces Institute of Pathology researchers in     In the US the FBI Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate has worked with the American Association for the Advancement of Science 's National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity to convene a series of meetings to discuss biosecurity which have included discussions of amateur biologists and ways to manage the risks to society it poses         At the National Institutes of Health National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity   leads efforts to educate the public on \" dual use research of concern\" for example with websites like \"Science Safety Security\"   In   DIYbio organized conferences to attempt to create codes of ethics for biohackers   Pat Mooney executive director of ETC Group is a critic of biohacking who argues that using a laptop computer published gene sequence information and mail-order synthetic DNA just about anyone has the potential to construct genes or entire genomes from scratch including those of the lethal pathogens in the near-future citation needed A   ETC Group report warns that the danger of this development is not just bio-terror but \"bio-error\"   While no DIYbio project to date has involved harmful agents citation needed the fear remains in the minds of both regulators and laypersons However it is often pointed out that DIYbio is at too early a stage to consider such advanced projects feasible as few successful transformative genetics projects have been undertaken yet It is also worth noting that while an individual could conceivably do harm with sufficient skill and intent there exist biology labs throughout the world with greater access to the technology skill and funding to accomplish a bioweapons project While detractors argue that do-it-yourself biologists need some sort of supervision enthusiasts argue that uniform supervision is impossible and the best way to prevent accidents or malevolence is to encourage a culture of transparency where in essence do-it-yourself biologists would be peer reviewed by other biohackers   Enthusiasts argue that fear of potential hazards should be met with increased research and education rather than closing the door on the profound positive impacts that distributed biological technology will have on human health the environment and the standard of living around the world   Due to the lack of precedent regarding such a business model the DIYbio founders see this as an opportunity to be innovators in regulatory and

open-source software FOSS and open-source hardware are created by this open-source culture movement and apply a like concept to a variety of components It is sometimes thus referred to as FOSH free

logo   OSHWA logo The first hardware focused \" open source \" activities were started around   by Bruce Perens creator of the Open Source Definition co-founder of the Open Source Initiative and a ham radio operator He launched the Open Hardware Certification Program which had the goal of allowing hardware manufacturers to self-certify their products as open     Shortly after the launch of the Open Hardware Certification Program David Freeman announced the Open Hardware Specification Project OHSpec another attempt at licensing hardware components whose interfaces are available publicly and of creating an entirely new computing platform as an alternative to proprietary computing systems   In early   Sepehr Kiani Ryan Vallance and Samir Nayfeh joined efforts to apply the open-source philosophy to machine design applications Together they established the Open Design Foundation ODF as a non-profit corporation and set out to develop an Open Design Definition But most of these activities faded out after a few years By the mid 2000s open-source hardware again became a hub of activity due to the emergence of several major open-source hardware projects and companies such as OpenCores RepRap 3D printing Arduino Adafruit and SparkFun In   Perens reactivated the openhardware org website Following the Open Graphics Project an effort to design implement and manufacture a free and open 3D graphics chip set and reference graphics card Timothy Miller suggested the creation of an organization to safeguard the interests of the Open Graphics Project community Thus Patrick McNamara founded the Open Hardware Foundation OHF in     The Tucson Amateur Packet Radio Corporation TAPR founded in   as a non-profit organization of amateur radio operators with the goals of supporting R&D efforts in the area of amateur digital communications created in   the first open hardware license the TAPR Open Hardware License The OSI president Eric S Raymond expressed some concerns about certain aspects of the OHL and decided to not review the license   Around   in context of the Freedom Defined project the Open Hardware Definition was created as collaborative work of many   and is accepted as of   by dozens of organizations and companies   In July   CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research released an open-source hardware license CERN OHL Javier Serrano an engineer at CERN's Beams Department and the founder of the Open Hardware Repository explained \"By sharing designs openly CERN expects to improve the quality of designs through peer review and to guarantee their users including commercial companies the freedom to study modify and manufacture them leading to better hardware and less duplication of efforts\"   While initially drafted to address CERN-specific concerns such as tracing the impact of the organization s research in its current form it can be used by anyone developing open-source hardware   Following the   Open Hardware Summit and after heated debates on licenses and what constitutes open-source hardware Bruce Perens abandoned the OSHW Definition and the concerted efforts of those involved with it   Openhardware org led by Bruce Perens promotes and identifies practices that meet all the combined requirements of the Open Source Hardware Definition the Open Source Definition and the Four Freedoms of the Free Software Foundation   Since   openhardware org is not online and seems to have ceased activity   The Open Source Hardware Association OSHWA at oshwa org proposes Open source hardware and acts as hub of open source hardware activity of all genres while cooperating with other entities such as TAPR CERN and OSI The OSHWA was established as an organization in June   in Delaware and filed for tax exemption status in July     After same debates about trademark interferences with the OSI in   the OSHWA and the OSI signed a co-existence agreement     In   after years of skepticism on the relevance of free hardware designs   the Free Software Foundation started the \" Respects Your Freedom \" RYF computer hardware product certification program It was intended to encourage the creation and sale of hardware that respects users' freedom and privacy and aims to ensure that users have control over their devices     RYF certified laptops faced criticism on the basis of being slow and outdated hardware     FSF's Replicant project suggested in   an alternative \"free hardware\" definition derived from the FSF's four freedoms   Forms of open-source hardware edit The term hardware in open source hardware has been historically used in opposition to the term software of open source software That is to refer to the electronic hardware on which the software runs see previous section However as more and more non-electronic hardware products are made open source for example Wikihouse OpenBeam or Hovalin this term tends to be used back in its broader sense of \"physical product\" The field of open source hardware has been shown to go beyond electronic hardware and to cover a larger range of product categories such as machine tools vehicles and medical equipment   In that sense hardware refers to any form of tangible product may it be electronic hardware mechanical hardware textile or even construction hardware The Open Source Hardware OSHW Definition     defines hardware as \"tangible artifacts machines devices or other physical things\"   Computers edit Due to a mixture of privacy security and environmental concerns a number of projects have started that aim to deliver a variety of open-source computing devices Examples include the EOMA68 SBC in a PCMCIA form-factor intended to be plugged into a laptop or desktop chassis Novena bare motherboard with optional laptop chassis and GnuBee series of Network Attached Storage devices Several retrocomputing hobby groups have created numerous recreations or adaptations of the early home computers of the 1970s and 80s some of which include improved functionality and more modern components such as surface-moun t ICs and SD card readers       Some hobbyists have also developed add-on cards such as drive controllers   memory expansion   and sound cards   to improve the functionality of older computers Miniaturised recreations of vintage computers have also been created   Electronics edit One of the most popular types of open-source hardware is electronics There are numerous companies that provide large varieties of open-source electronics such as Sparkfun Adafruit and Seeed In addition there are NPOs and companies that provide a specific open-source electronic component such as the Arduino electronics prototyping platform There are numerous examples of speciality open-source electronics such as low-cost voltage and current GMAW open-source 3-D printer monitor     and a robotics-assisted mass spectrometry assay platform     Open-source electronics finds various uses including automation of chemical procedures     Mecha tro nics edit A large range of products including mechanical components have been developed so far from machine tools to vehicles over musical instruments and medical equipment   Examples of machine-tools are the 3D printers RepRap and Ultimaker as well as the laser cutter Lasersaur In the category vehicles we can find bikes like XYZ Space Frame Vehicles and cars like the Tabby OSVehicle Examples of medical equipment are the echostethoscope echOpen and a wide range of prosthetic hands listed in the review study by Ten Kate et al   e g the OpenBionics Prosthetic Hands Others edit Examples of open-source hardware products can also be found to a lesser extent in construction Wikihouse and textile Kit Z ro Kilom tres Licenses edit Rather than creating a new license some open-source hardware projects simply use existing free and open-source software licenses   These licenses may not accord well with patent law   Later several new licenses have been proposed designed to address issues specific to hardware designs   In these licenses many of the fundamental principles expressed in open-source software OSS licenses have been \"ported\" to their counterpart hardware projects New hardware licenses are often explained as the \"hardware equivalent\" of a well-known OSS license such as the GPL LGPL or BSD license Despite superficial similarities to software licenses most hardware licenses are fundamentally different by nature they typically rely more heavily on patent law than on copyright law as many hardware designs are not copyrightable   Whereas a copyright license may control the distribution of the source code or design documents a patent license may control the use and manufacturing of the physical device built from the design documents This distinction is explicitly mentioned in the preamble of the TAPR Open Hardware License \" those who benefit from an OHL design may not bring lawsuits claiming that design infringes their patents or other intellectual property \" TAPR Open Hardware License   Noteworthy licenses include The TAPR Open Hardware License drafted by attorney John Ackermann reviewed by OSS community leaders Bruce Perens and Eric S Raymond and discussed by hundreds of volunteers in an open community discussion     Balloon Open Hardware License used by all projects in the Balloon Project Although originally a software license OpenCores encourages the LGPL Hardware Design Public License written by Graham Seaman admin of Opencollector org In March   CERN released the CERN Open Hardware License OHL   intended for use with the Open Hardware Repository   and other projects The Solderpad License   is a version of the Apache License version     amended by lawyer Andrew Katz to render it more appropriate for hardware use The Open Source Hardware Association recommends seven licenses which follow their open-source hardware definition   From the general copyleft licenses the GNU General Public License GPL and Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license from the HW specific copyleft licenses the CERN Open Hardware License OHL and TAPR Open Hardware License OHL and from the permissive licenses the FreeBSD license the MIT license and the Creative Commons Attribution license   Openhardware org recommended in   the TAPR Open Hardware License Creative Commons BY-SA     and GPL     license   Organizations tend to rally around a shared license For example OpenCores prefers the LGPL or a Modified BSD License   FreeCores insists on the GPL   Open Hardware Foundation promotes \" copyleft or other permissive licenses\"   the Open Graphics Project us   es a variety of licenses including the MIT license GPL and a proprietary license   and the Balloon Project wrote their own license   Development edit The OSHW Open Source Hardware logo silkscreened on an unpopulated PCB The adjective \"open-source\" not only refers to a specific set of freedoms applying to a product but also generally presupposes that the product is the object or the result of a \"process that relies on the contributions of geographically dispersed developers via the Internet \"   In practice however in both fields of open-source hardware and open-source software products may either be the result of a development process performed by a closed team in a private setting or by a community in a public environment the first case being more frequent than the second which is more challenging   Establishing a community-based product development process faces several challenges such as to find appropriate product data management tools document not only the product but also the development process itself accepting losing ubiquitous control over the project ensure continuity in a context of fickle participation of voluntary project members among others   The Arduino Diecimila another popular and early open source hardware design One of the major differences between developing open-source software and developing open-source hardware is that hardware results in tangible outputs which cost money to prototype and manufacture As a result the phrase \"free as in speech not as in beer\"   more formally known as Gratis versus Libre distinguishes between the idea of zero cost and the freedom to use and modify information While open-source hardware faces challenges in minimizing cost and reducing financial risks for individual project developers some community members have proposed models to address these needs   Given this there are initiatives to develop sustainable community funding mechanisms such as the Open Source Hardware Central Bank Extensive discussion has taken place on ways to make open-source hardware as accessible as open-source software Providing clear and detailed product documentation is an essential factor facilitating product replication and collaboration in hardware development projects Practical guides have been developed to help practitioners to do so     Another option is to design products so they are easy to replicate as exemplified in the concept of open-source appropriate technology   The process of developing open-source hardware in a community-based setting is alternatively called open design open source development   or open source product development   All these terms are instantiations of the open-source model applicable for the development of any product may it be software hardware cultural educational and so on See here for a delineation of these terms A major contributor to the production of open-source hardware product designs is the scientific community There has been considerable work to produce open-source hardware for scientific hardware using a combination of open-source electronics and 3-D printing       Other sources of open-source hardware production are vendors of chips and other electronic components sponsoring contests with the provision that the participants and winners must share their designs Circuit Cellar magazine organizes some of these contests Open-source labs edit A guide has been published Open-Source Lab book by Joshua Pearce on using open-source electronics and 3D printing to make open-source labs Today scientists are creating many such labs examples include Boston Open Source Science Laboratory Somerville Massachusetts BYU Open Source Lab Brigham Young University Michigan Tech   National Tsing Hua University   OSU Open Source Lab Oregon State University Open Source Research Lab University of Texas at El Paso Business models edit Open hardware companies are experimenting with different business models   In one example littleBits implements open-source business models by making the design files available for the circuit designs in each littleBits module in accordance with the CERN Open Hardware License Version       In another example Arduino has registered its name as a trademark Others may manufacture their designs but can't put the Arduino name on them Thus they can distinguish their products from others by appellation   There are many applicable business models for implementing some open-source hardware even in traditional firms For example to accelerate development and technical innovation the photovoltaic industry has experimented with partnerships franchises secondary supplier and completely open-source models   Recently many open source hardware projects were funded via crowdfunding on Indiegogo or Kickstarter Especially popular is Crowd Supply for crowdfunding open hardware projects   Reception and impact edit Cover for \" Open-Source Lab \" by Joshua M Pearce   Richard Stallman the founder of the free software movement was in   skeptical on the idea and relevance of Free hardware his terminology for what is now known as open-source hardware   In a   Wired article he adapted his point of view slightly while he still sees no ethical parallel between free software and free hardware he acknowledges the importance   Also Stallman uses and suggests the term free hardware design over open source hardware a request which is consistent with his earlier rejection of the term open source software see also Alternative terms for free software   Other authors such as Joshua Pearce have argued there is an ethical imperative for open-source hardware specifically with respect to open-source appropriate technology for sustainable development   In   he also wrote the book Open-Source Lab How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs which details the development of free and open-source hardware primarily for scientists and university faculty     Find open-source hardware products edit Some ongoing initiatives provide indexes of open-source hardware products for different purposes The Open Source Hardware Association provides a certification programme and maintains a directory of certified products The Observatory of Open Source Hardware aims at supporting exchange of best practices between practitioners It maintains an open access and curated directory of open source hardware products rated according to their degree of openness This directory contains references of more than   complex open source hardware products The P2P Foundation maintains an Open Hardware Directory as well See also some specific lists in Wikipedia List of

can be converted to electric Many people prefer to pick a vehicle that is light and aerodynamic in order to maximize distance traveled per battery charge There must also be adequate room and load capacity for batteries The battery pack which provides a source of electrical power The most commonly available and affordable batteries are lead-acid flooded type Next are the AGM Absorption Glass Mat sealed maintenance free batteries a little more powerful and expensive Then there are the more exotic batteries like Ni-MH and Li-ion more difficult to find but light and longer lasting maintenance free and much more expensive The new lithium batteries are showing some promise for EVs in the near future The charger which restores energy to the batteries which may be mounted within the vehicle or at a special charging station at some fixed location The power controller which regulates the flow of energy between the battery and the electric motor s controlled by an electronic throttle One or more electric motors and their mechanical attachment to the driveline Power conductors connecting the battery controller and motor s Accessory equipment to power auxiliary equipment such as power brakes and heating system Control circuitry and equipment to allow control and interlocking of the various components Instrumentation specific to the operation and maintenance of the conversion Hobbyists and conversions edit Eliica prototype The full electric Formula Student car of the Eindhoven University of Technology Hobbyists often build their own EVs by converting existing production cars to run solely on electricity There is a cottage industry supporting the conversion and construction of BEVs by hobbyists   Universities such as the University of California Irvine even build their own custom electric or hybrid-electric cars from scratch Short-range battery electric vehicles can offer the hobbyist comfort utility and quickness sacrificing only range Short-range EVs may be built using high-performance lead acid batteries using about half the mass needed for a     km     miles range The result is a vehicle with about a   km   miles range which when designed with appropriate weight distribution 40/60 front to rear does not require power steering offers exceptional acceleration in the lower end of its operating range and is freeway capable and legal But their EVs are expensive due to the higher cost for these higher-performance batteries By including a manual transmission short-range EVs can obtain both better performance and greater efficiency than the single-speed EVs developed by major manufacturers Unlike the converted golf carts used for neighborhood electric vehicles short-range EVs may be operated on typical suburban throughways where     km/h     mph speed limits are typical and can keep up with traffic typical on such roads and the short \"slow-lane\" on-and-off segments of freeways common in suburban areas Faced with chronic fuel shortage on the Gaza Strip Palestinian electrical engineer Waseem Othman al-Khozendar invented in   a way to convert his car to run on   electric batteries According to al-Khozendar the batteries can be charged with US$2 worth of electricity to drive from     km     mi After a 7-hour charge the car should also be able to run up to a speed of   km/h   mph     In   several Chinese manufacturers began marketing lithium iron phosphate LiFePO   batteries directly to hobbyists and vehicle conversion shops These batteries offered much better power-to-weight ratios allowing vehicle conversions to typically achieve     km     mi per charge Prices gradually declined to approximately US$350 per kW h by mid-2009 As the LiFePO   cells feature life ratings of     cycles compared to typical lead acid battery ratings of   cycles the life expectancy of LiFePO   cells is around   years LiFePO   cells require more expensive battery management and charging systems than lead acid batteries citation needed Solar power edit   Solar vehicle On-board solar cells can be used to power an electric vehicle     The small power generated by solar cells mounted on a vehicle means that the other components in the system must be special to compensate for this For example the body of even a small conventional car converted to electric is still too heavy to be driven by on-board solar cells A practical solar powered vehicle is designed from the ground up with specially made parts Conversion process edit Most conversions in North America are performed by hobbyists   who typically will convert a well used vehicle with a non-functioning engine since such defective vehicles can be quite inexpensive to purchase Other hobbyists with larger budgets may prefer to convert a later model vehicle or a vehicle of a particular type In some cases the vehicle itself may be built by the converter or assembled from a kit car A two-stage vehicle is a vehicle that has been built by two separate manufacturers The result is a standard complete vehicle   In this process vehicles may be converted by a manufacturer as was done by Ford Motor Company to create the Ford Ranger EV Alternatively in a process known as \"third-party power trainization \" an independent converter will purchase new vehicle gliders   vehicles without a motor or related equipment and then perform the conversion to offer a two-stage vehicle In some countries the user can choose to buy a converted vehicle of any model in the automaker dealerships only paying the cost of the batteries and motor with no installation costs it is called pre-conversion or previous conversion Industry edit The electric vehicle conversion industry has grown to include conversion car garages   aftermarket kits   and vehicle components     Vehicle types edit Electric bicycle edit A bicycle with an aftermarket hub-motor in the front wheel An electric bicycle is a conventional bicycle that has been fitted with an electric motor Converting an existing bicycle by retrofitting it with a \"conversion kit\" is the simplest and least expensive electric vehicle conversion option Most often electric bicycles or \"e-bikes\" are powered by rechargeable batteries however some experimental electric bicycles run directly on or recharge their batteries via solar panels fuel cells gas generators or other alternative energy sources Some experimenters have even used super capacitors to store energy Using an on-board generator may impact the legal jurisdictional definition of an electric bicycle A few types of electric bicycles are able to re-capture a small amount of energy from braking and can re-charge the batteries while braking or traveling down hills regenerative braking Some electric bikes have features where the motor can move the bicycle by itself immediate start if the rider chooses not to pedal with a button or throttle controller while others require the rider to pedal at all times pedal assist This latter type may in some jurisdictions allow the vehicle to be used on bicycle trails that otherwise prohibit motorized vehicles of any kind See motorized bicycle Many battery technologies are available for powering electric bikes The most common and least expensive battery technology is sealed lead acid but LiFePO   is fast becoming the battery of choice for the e-bike Converting one's bike to electric with a conversion kit is an easy and affordable solution for most people interested in learning more about electric vehicle conversion There may be some problems with the warranty however on the original bicycle being converted if an electric bike conversion kit is added Low-speed scooters are not typically suitable for on-the-road use These may be configured for either standing or sitting use Some local laws apply bicycle laws to scooters such as helmet and pedestrian right-of-way considerations Electric scooter Custom drag bike Solar cruiser Economy coupe edit This elderly Fiat employs batteries that can be mounted in any position Owing to its light weight and efficiency a light vehicle can make an excellent choice particularly if care is taken in component selection and placement It is possible to obtain conversion kits for some popular light vehicles most notably the rear motor rear drive Volkswagen Beetle its Type   evolution and its successor the front motor/drive VW Golf By converting a light vehicle it is possible to use a smaller motor which both weighs and costs less than a larger motor A lighter overall vehicle weight will reduce power consumption in start-and-stop traffic and increase range in many practical driving conditions In the same way that a gasoline-powered economy car is cheaper and more efficient to run an electric-powered economy car is as well Compact sedan or coupe edit A compact sedan may be a better choice than a subcompact owing to better load capacity and more room for battery placement Some commercial EV Conversions use vehicles in this size range One example is a   Honda Civic   In this conversion the back seat was retained and there is still enough room to sink nine flooded lead-acid batteries low in the trunk where the spare tire was located as well as another nine batteries under the hood Another example is a   Mitsubishi Tredia where the rear batteries have been raised above the trunk floorspace sealed and externally vented With suspension modifications increasing shock length & spring rating the car must still be below GVWR even with the driver and passengers Exceeding the total design weight of the vehicle would be illegal in some states and might result in cancellation by an insurance company There is an effort by several engineers in California to make the Toyota Prius a \" Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle \" or PHEV whereby the first   miles are driven by all-electric power then the gas engine comes on to re-charge the batteries only if the commute is further than   mi If it is less one can just plug it into the utility grid to re-charge the batteries The process is done by removing the nickel-metal hydride batteries and installing different batteries and a different battery management system Since   April   the Electric Car Corporation have been selling the Citro n C1 ev'ie an all-electric conversion from the Citro n C1 Full-size sedan edit Full-size sedans and minivans are generally considered to be poor candidates for EV conversion As the suspension and tires are already operating close to the maximum permissible clarification needed it may be necessary to make substantial modifications in these areas It may be easier to obtain upgraded suspension components for some smaller vehicles if these are also typically used for sports racing particularly autocross Starting with a heavy vehicle and adding batteries will result in poor performance in acceleration handling braking and economy of operation One of possibilities is using the body of Audi's D2 platform A8     Audi A8 or sports sedan S8     or older European market models where the German model weights   kg Audi S8 both of which are all aluminium monocoque \" Audi Space Frame \" vehicle which helped to significantly reduce weight without being any less rigid Sports car edit For a person interested in sports car performance and appearance the creation of a satisfying conversion will likely lead to a number of difficulties in such details as battery disposition as such vehicles generally have available space distributed in small volumes around the vehicle This leads to complexity in securing and wiring batteries These vehicles can offer stunning performance in the lower speed ranges owing to light weight and rear wheel drive and may also offer good range due to their superior aerodynamics The     Porsche   is one of the more successful sports car conversions as well as being one of the most popular Once converted it boasts better performance in range acceleration and top speed than most other vehicles Also its low acquisition costs contributes to its popularity as a conversion candidate Some manufacturers of conversion kits have made a kit specific to the   Another popular sports car used for conversion is the     Toyota MR2 Reasons for its popularity are low weight before conversion low cost to purchase the car and available locations within the car to place the large batteries that most people use lead-acid and its derivative technologies The later MR2 body style Mark   does not seem as popular and as of March   there is only one known conversion   A   Mitsubishi Starion was converted to all-electric in   by Carmel Morris and Nathan Bolton in Australia This sports vehicle had divided front/rear battery load for well-balanced low center of gravity performance The battery pack consisted of   x   2v nominal lithium ion batteries The tar weight of the final result was not much greater than the original specification allowing the sports car to be engineering road-certified as a four-seat vehicle The builders wanted to prove that an electric car conversion could also include other options such as power steering and air conditioning as is the norm for new electric vehicles without sacrificing excess energy or comfort Information on the successful Electric Starion conversion can be found on the web The Bradley GT II as well as other VW-based kit cars are very popular conversion candidates due to their being inexpensive extensive support groups as well as their simple sports car design Availability of conversion kits for these cars are quite prevalent with commercial retail establishments that specialize in EV conversions Light truck edit Light trucks are especially suitable for hobbyist conversion because it is easy to locate batteries remote from the passenger compartment and there is a good load handling capacity for the use of heavy batteries such as the flooded lead-acid batteries commonly used in golf carts Light trucks also offer substantial utility in use simply because they are trucks Even if a portion of the weight capacity is removed by the presence of batteries within or below the cargo bed much or all of the spatial utility remains A light truck is highly recommended as a first conversion effort because of the simplicity of component layout With proper battery placement the stability of a late production truck can be improved over the ICE version While a number of suitable vehicles are available in pre-2002 models the modern evolution of this type has become taller heavier bulkier and less efficient and their excessive height makes under-bed battery placement essential to keep the center of gravity low enough for stability on curves Other trucks full size and most SUVs edit These are rarely converted due to their excessive weight and aerodynamic inefficiencies To make the situation worse many modern trucks and SUVs continue to get bulkier heavier and their high stance means the height of the center of gravity leads to instability while making high speed turns a distinct disadvantage if there is not enough room between the frame rails to enable low battery mounting As a direct result the payload carrying capacity and thus the GVWR of the vehicles goes down Such a trait is not desirable because it limits the weight of the battery pack that can be carried limiting the maximum battery-to-vehicle weight ratio that could be achieved for the vehicle when converted to an EV Such considerations are important due to price weight and performance limitations of current battery technologies For a given battery type reducing the battery-to-vehicle weight ratio always results in reduced vehicle range per charge However despite these mostly unavoidable limitations several SUVs and larger trucks have been successfully converted to electric power by hobbyists Some examples include the \"Gone Postal\" van converted to an EV racer by Roderick Wilde and Suckamps EV Racing the Land Rover EV converted by Wilde Evolutions and the   Jeep Cherokee EV converted by Nick Viera Classic Cars edit Although technologically feasible classic cars are not widely converted in order to maintain a car's authenticity The German company ReeVOLT has however made it one of their business branches to convert old Trabants for use in tourism in the east of Germany in connection to the car's regional historic significance and to allow easy access to environmental zones such as city centers and in particular the partially car-free island of R gen The car is considered ideal for conversions because of its low used price and low weight due to the small size and resin fiber construction   Electric buses edit The principal efforts in the development of autonomous electric buses this is without trolleys and wires have involved limited production of very expensive fuel cell vehicles The most economically effective development in this area involves the creation of hybrid electric buses mainly plug-in hybrids well suited to this application owing to frequent stops and starts and effective energy recovery and release in this cycle Another solution is the conversion to battery electric buses that follow the principle of replacing discharged batteries instead of recharging Racers edit Hotrod edit While this type of vehicle is usually made to be a \" street-legal \" performance machine it may also be developed for occasional use as a drag racing vehicle The leading vehicle in this field is the \"Maniac Mazda\" a Mazda RX-7 sports car converted from rotary engine to electric by Roderick Wilde   This vehicle can outrun Dodge Viper and Ferrari sports cars in quarter-mile drag races Autocross racer edit EV's have proven successful in autocross competition The electric motor's ability to deliver maximum torque at   RPM and a comparatively broad torque band provide good throttle response and allow running an autocross without any time lost to shifting gears The short distance of the typical autocross requires less stored energy than most forms of motorsports This minimizes electric vehicle's most obvious competitive disadvantage the weight penalty of batteries compared to gasoline The Batt mobile in autocross   in Queensland Australia Drag racer edit Intended only for specialized straight line quarter-mile acceleration racing this type of vehicle is used only \"off road\" at specialized \" dragstrips \" High speed straight line racer edit For an example of a straight line racer see Buckeye Bullet Even more specialized than the drag racer this is intended to obtain high speeds on long straight and flat raceways such as the dry lake beds found in locations such as the Bonneville Salt Flats Closed circuit road racer edit Closed Circuit Road racing particularly any type of endurance racing is one of the greatest challenges for EV's Pound per pound gasoline contains far more energy than even the most advanced of current batteries An electric vehicle must be heavier or more efficient to run the same distance as its gasoline competitor Endurance racing strategies include battery packs that can be changed quickly and \" Dump charging \" Custom chassis edit Suitable for a builder who is capable of constructing a kit car with good abilities and equipment in machining and welding this can result in a unique vehicle It is especially suitable for the construction of a lightweight vehicle that can offer exceptional performance Many VW-based kit car companies have tube chassis ready to start with A glider kit includes all components of a vehicle except the power train       Novelty vehicle edit A novelty vehicle or an electric powered art car may not be suitable for on road use Applications include electric vehicle show demonstrations parades parade floats float towing and eclectic off-road gatherings such as Burning Man This vehicle is ideal for the beach where not prohibited and to promote tourist places but will usually require trailering to its operating site At the   Stanford University EV Gathering Above Bob Schneeveis   demonstrates his Silver Sofa Registration of converted and newly constructed vehicles edit   Vehicle registration United States edit The ease of registration will vary by state Some states require safety inspections usually to ensure body integrity in areas subject to severe corrosion from winter road de-icing materials In any case for general registration all functional safety equipment should be operating turn signals brake lights headlights horn etc The windshield should have no running cracks small stone chips and \"stars\" may be acceptable if not in the driver's principal line of vision If the vehicle has been reconstructed from a salvage vehicle a vehicle whose registration has been forfeited inspection may be more severe to ensure compliance and the legitimacy of sources of salvage components by presentation of proper purchase receipts Registration procedures will vary by state and will usually be more difficult even bizarre in states with strict emissions requirements even though a plug-in only conversion will be a zero emission vehicle Arguing with DMV staff is typically futile in all jurisdictions but there may be appeal procedures available but whose availability may not be openly publicized On the other hand changing the registration allows a conversion to qualify for tax incentives available in some states such as Oregon for either the vehicle the charging system or both California US conversion registration and taxation edit Registration of a converted existing or newly self constructed electric vehicle in California is no longer difficult This falls into two categories First if the vehicle is built from new frame components and possibly some salvage parts i e it has never been a previously titled motorcar previously but it has brakes or axles that were obtained used/rebuilt In California if you \"create\" a car from scratch and want to register and title it with DMV you need to go through the \"Specially Constructed Vehicle Emission Control Program\" or SPCNS for short this is also called California \"SB100\" program Or Second a previously registered vehicle converted to electric propulsion SPCNC In the past the process of registering an SPCNS vehicle required meeting with an outside referee at a community college or one of the states mobile referee stations to verify the vehicle The current process happens at the DMV with the inspection being done by A DMV inspector The inspector will need to be able to see the motor and batteries and verify that there in no internal combustion engine The vehicle will still need a brake and light inspection By an outside inspector to verify its compliance with other vehicle codes Currently Registered Vehicles If you are converting an existing vehicle and it is older than   you may opt to not bother to get the vehicle converted to the \"E\" code unless you are looking for the Diamond Lane stickers since these vehicles don't require a smog inspection For vehicles newer than   you will need to go the DMV and have the vehicle inspected as a conversion The batteries and motor will have to be exposed so the inspector can see them and verify that there is no internal combustion engine The next step requires the clerk at the local California Department of Motor Vehicles DMV office to call the Sacramento office Only the Sacramento office can make this entry into the computer system If the local clerk tries the system will default to the \"Q\" code for hybrid These procedures are in place to inhibit fraudulent registration of ICE vehicles as Electric in order to avoid smog inspections A hybrid is not exempt from smog inspection Before you leave the DMV make sure your printout has the proper \"E\" code or you will have to go back to do it again There is weight fee of $87 for vehicles under     kg     lb or $266 for vehicles from     to     kg     to     lb This is in addition to any regular registration fees Spain edit In Spain the conversion called transformation is regulated by Real Decreto 866/2010 de   de julio por el que se regula la tramitaci n de las reformas de veh culos     edit Aftermarket automotive CalCars Electric car Engine swap Green tuning Kit car

The Reflection step is a pause in our activities where we gather data impressions history stories and any other observations about what we have done In order to do this effectively we must develop and exercise the capacity for Detachment detachment from preconceived notions Learning - In the Learning step we carefully examine the observations made in the Reflection step and \"discover\" new insights skills relationships structures failures or any other conceptual changes We search for the principles involved in our work In order to do this effectively we must develop and exercise the capacity of Search search for the underlying principles Planning - In the Planning Step we apply the conceptual understandings we have developed We use these newly discovered principles to systematically to create a plan of action We should directly reflect in our planning each insight or principle we have learned In order to do this step effectively we must develop and exercise the capacity for Love love for the act of learning Action - In the Action Step as an individual team or organization we carry out the plans we have created We do our work In order to do this effectively we must have Courage courage to plunge into the unknown The Four Capacities edit Each of the four capacities in the Learning Circle are prerequisites for taking the next step At the same time as we exercise these capacities through the use of the Learning Circle we develop these capacities within ourselves in our teams and in our organizations Our inner conditions and capabilities have an effect on our environment which in turn then has an effect on us By going through the Learning Circle we use and develop these four capacities Detachment- The capacity for Detachment supports the Reflection step Detachment is openness Detachment means that we set aside our ego and objectively look at the evidence including facts events and feelings Search- The capacity for Search supports the Learning step Search includes consultation wisdom discernment judgement and search for solutions Love of the Work - The capacity for Love of the learning supports the Planning step Love creates openness to Guidance Love engenders vision passion and a sense of purpose Courage -The capacity for Courage supports the Action step Courage encompasses conscious choice volition willingness and desire to act even in the face of uncertainty Guidance -

rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command to their use It entails effective communication and problem solving abilities as well as a commitment to overcome our native egocentrism     and

Further reading History edit The earliest documentation of critical thinking are the teachings of Socrates recorded by Plato Socrates established the fact that one cannot depend upon those in \"authority\" to have sound knowledge and insight He demonstrated that persons may have power and high position and yet be deeply confused and irrational He established the importance of asking deep questions that probe profoundly into thinking before we accept ideas as worthy of belief He established the importance of seeking evidence closely examining reasoning and assumptions analyzing basic concepts and tracing out implications not only of what is said but of what is done as well His method of questioning is now known as \"Socratic Questioning\" and is the best known critical thinking teaching strategy In his mode of questioning Socrates highlighted the need for thinking for clarity and logical consistency Socrates asked people questions to reveal their irrational thinking or lack of reliable knowledge Socrates demonstrated that having authority does not ensure accurate knowledge He established the method of questioning beliefs closely inspecting assumptions and relying on evidence and sound rationale Plato recorded Socrates' teachings and carried on the tradition of critical thinking Aristotle and subsequent Greek skeptics refined Socrates' teachings using systematic thinking and asking questions to ascertain the true nature of reality beyond the way things appear from a glance   Socrates set the agenda for the tradition of critical thinking namely to reflectively question common beliefs and explanations carefully distinguishing beliefs that are reasonable and logical from those that however appealing to our native egocentrism however much they serve our vested interests however comfortable or comforting they may be lack adequate evidence or rational foundation to warrant belief Critical thinking was described by Richard W Paul as a movement in two waves     The \"first wave\" of critical thinking is often referred to as a 'critical analysis' that is clear rational thinking involving critique Its details vary amongst those who define it According to Barry K Beyer   critical thinking means making clear reasoned judgments During the process of critical thinking ideas should be reasoned well thought out and judged   The U S National Council for Excellence in Critical Thinking   defines critical thinking as the \"intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing applying analyzing synthesizing or evaluating information gathered from or generated by observation experience reflection reasoning or communication as a guide to belief and action \"   Etymology edit Critical Thinking Skills Diagram In the term critical thinking the word critical Grk = kritikos = \"critic\" derives from the word critic and implies a critique it identifies the intellectual capacity and the means \"of judging\" \"of judgement\" \"for judging\" and of being \"able to discern\"   The intellectual roots of critical   thinking are as ancient as its etymology traceable ultimately to the teaching practice and vision of Socrates       years ago who discovered by a method of probing questioning that people could not rationally justify their confident claims to knowledge Definitions edit Traditionally critical thinking has been variously defined as \"The process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing applying analyzing synthesizing and evaluating information to reach an answer or conclusion\"   \"Disciplined thinking that is clear rational open-minded and informed by evidence\"   \"Reasonable reflective thinking focused on deciding what to believe or do\"   \"Purposeful self-regulatory judgment which results in interpretation analysis evaluation and inference as well as explanation of the evidential conceptual methodological criteriological or contextual considerations upon which that judgment is based\"   \"includes a commitment to using reason in the formulation of our beliefs\"   the skill and propensity to engage in an activity with reflective scepticism McPeck     Thinking about one's thinking in a manner designed to organize and clarify raise the efficiency of and recognize errors and biases in one's own thinking Critical thinking is not 'hard' thinking nor is it directed at solving problems other than 'improving' one's own thinking Critical thinking is inward-directed with the intent of maximizing the rationality of the thinker One does not use critical thinking to solve problems one uses critical thinking to improve one's process of thinking   \"An appraisal based on careful analytical evaluation\"   Contemporary critical thinking scholars have expanded these traditional definitions to include qualities concepts and processes such as creativity imagination discovery reflection empathy connecting knowing feminist theory subjectivity ambiguity and inconclusiveness Some

connections between two concepts or points in thought It followed a philosophy where the thinker was removed from the train of thought and the connections and the analysis of the connect was devoid of any bias of the thinker Kerry Walters describes this ideology in his essay Beyond Logicism in Critical Thinking \"A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal and to a lesser extent formal logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical abstract universal and objective This model of thinking has become so entrenched in conventional academic wisdom that many educators accept it as canon\" Walters   p   The adoption of these principals parallels themselves with the increasing reliance on a quantitative understanding of the world In the second wave of critical thinking as defined by Kerry S Walters Re-thinking Reason   p   many authors moved away from the logocentric mode of critical thinking that the first wave privileged especially in institutions of higher learning Walters summarizes logicism as \"the unwarranted assumption that good thinking is reducible to logical thinking\"   p   \"A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal and to a lesser extent formal logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical abstract universal and objective \" Walters   p   As the second wave took hold scholars began to take a more inclusive view of what constituted as critical thinking Rationality and logic are still widely accepted in many circles as the primary examples of critical thinking Deduction Abduction and Induction edit   logical reasoning There are three types of logical reasoning Informally two kinds of logical reasoning can be distinguished in addition to formal deduction induction and abduction Deduction is the conclusion of a consequence given premises that logically follow by modus ponens e g X is human and all humans have a face so X has a face Induction is drawing a conclusion from a pattern that is guaranteed by the strictness of the structure to which it applies e g The sum of even integers is even 2x+2y =   x+y The sum of integers is an integer and x and y are integers so 2x+2y=2z where z is an integer thus 2z is an even integer so the sum of even integers is even Abduction is drawing a conclusion using a heuristic that is likely but not inevitable given some foreknowledge e g I observe sheep in a field and they appear white from my viewing angle so sheep are white Contrast with the deductive statement \"Some sheep are white on at least one side \" Critical thinking and rationality edit This article or section may have been copied and pasted from a source possibly in violation of

sure that the supposed source of the copyright violation is not itself a Wikipedia mirror February   Kerry S Walters Re-thinking Reason   argues that rationality demands more than just logical or traditional methods of problem solving and analysis or what he calls the \"calculus of justification\" but also considers \" cognitive acts such as imagination conceptual creativity intuition and insight\" p   These \"functions\" are focused on discovery on more abstract processes instead of linear rules-based approaches to problem-solving The linear and non-sequential mind must both be engaged in the rational mind The ability to critically analyze an argument to dissect structure and components thesis and reasons is essential But so is the ability to be flexible and consider non-traditional alternatives and perspectives These complementary functions are what allow for critical thinking a practice encompassing imagination and intuition in cooperation with traditional modes of deductive inquiry Functions edit The list of core critical thinking skills includes observation interpretation analysis inference evaluation explanation and metacognition According to Reynolds   an individual or group engaged in a strong way of critical thinking gives due consideration to establish for instance   Evidence through reality Context skills to isolate the problem from context Relevant criteria for making the judgment well Applicable methods or techniques for forming the judgment Applicable theoretical constructs for understanding the problem and the question at hand In addition to possessing strong critical-thinking skills one must be disposed to engage problems and decisions using those skills Critical thinking employs not only logic but broad intellectual criteria such as clarity credibility accuracy precision relevance depth breadth significance and fairness   Procedure edit Critical thinking calls for the ability to Recognize problems to find workable means for meeting those problems Understand the importance of prioritization and order of precedence in problem solving Gather and marshal pertinent relevant information Recognize unstated assumptions and values Comprehend and use language with accuracy clarity and discernment Interpret data to appraise evidence and evaluate arguments Recognize the existence or non-existence of logical relationships between propositions Draw warranted conclusions and generalizations Put to test the conclusions and generalizations at which one arrives Reconstruct one's patterns of beliefs on the basis of wider experience Render accurate judgments about specific things and qualities in everyday life In sum \"A persistent effort to examine any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the evidence that supports or refutes it and the further conclusions to which it tends \"   Habits or traits of mind edit The habits of mind that characterize a person strongly disposed toward critical thinking include a desire to follow reason and evidence wherever they may lead a systematic approach to problem solving inquisitiveness even-handedness and confidence in reasoning   According to a definition analysis by Kompf & Bond   critical thinking involves problem solving decision making metacognition   rationality rational thinking reasoning knowledge intelligence and also a moral component such as reflective thinking Critical thinkers therefore need to have reached a level of maturity in their development possess a certain attitude as well as a set of taught skills Research edit Edward M Glaser proposed that the ability to think critically involves three elements   An attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one's experiences Knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning Some skill in applying those methods Educational programs aimed at developing critical thinking in children and adult learners individually or in group problem solving and decision making contexts continue to address these same three central elements The Critical Thinking project at Human Science Lab London is involved in scientific study of all major educational system in prevalence today to assess how the systems are working to promote or impede critical thinking   Contemporary cognitive psychology regards human reasoning as a complex process that is both reactive and reflective   The relationship between critical thinking skills and critical thinking dispositions is an empirical question Some people have both in abundance some have skills but not the disposition to use them some are disposed but lack strong skills and some have neither A measure of critical thinking dispositions is the California Measure of Mental Motivation   and the California Critical Thinking Dispositions Inventory   The CriTT is an alternative measure that examines student beliefs and attitudes about critical thinking   Education edit John Dewey is one of many educational leaders who recognized that a curriculum aimed at building thinking skills would benefit the individual learner the community and the entire democracy   Critical thinking is significant in academics due to being significant in learning Critical thinking is significant in the learning process of internalization in the construction of basic ideas principles and theories inherent in content And critical thinking is significant in the learning process of application whereby those ideas principles and theories are implemented effectively as they become relevant in learners' lives Each discipline adapts its use of critical thinking concepts and principles The core concepts are always there but they are embedded in subject-specific content For students to learn content intellectual engagement is crucial All students must do their own thinking their own construction of knowledge Good teachers recognize this and therefore focus on the questions readings activities that stimulate the mind to take ownership of key concepts and principles underlying the subject Historically teaching of critical thinking focused only on logical procedures such as formal and informal logic This emphasized to students that good thinking is equivalent to logical thinking However a second wave of critical thinking urges educators to value conventional techniques meanwhile expanding what it means to be a critical thinker In   Kerry Walters   compiled a conglomeration of sources surpassing this logical restriction to include many different authors research regarding connected knowing empathy gender-sensitive ideals collaboration world views intellectual autonomy morality and enlightenment These concepts invite students to incorporate their own perspectives and experiences into their thinking In the English and Welsh school systems Critical Thinking is offered as a subject that 16- to 18-year-olds can take as an A-Level Under the OCR exam board students can sit two exam papers for the AS \"Credibility of Evidence\" and \"Assessing and Developing Argument\" The full Advanced GCE is now available in addition to the two AS units candidates sit the two papers \"Resolution of Dilemmas\" and \"Critical Reasoning\" The A-level tests candidates on their ability to think critically about and analyze arguments on their deductive or inductive validity as well as producing their own arguments It also tests their ability to analyze certain related topics such as credibility and ethical decision-making However due to its comparative lack of subject content many universities do not accept it as a main A-level for admissions   Nevertheless the AS is often useful in developing reasoning skills and the full Advanced GCE is useful for degree courses in politics philosophy history or theology providing the skills required for critical analysis that are useful for example in biblical study There used to also be an Advanced Extension Award offered in Critical Thinking in the UK open to any A-level student regardless of whether they have the Critical Thinking A-level Cambridge International Examinations have an A-level in Thinking Skills   From   Assessment and Qualifications Alliance has also been offering an A-level Critical Thinking specification   OCR exam board have also modified theirs for   Many examinations for university entrance set by universities on top of A-level examinations also include a critical thinking component such as the LNAT the UKCAT the BioMedical Admissions Test and the Thinking Skills Assessment In Qatar critical thinking was offered by AL-Bairaq an outreach non-traditional educational program that targets high school students and focuses on a curriculum based on STEM fields The idea behind AL-Bairaq is to offer high school students the opportunity to connect with the research environment in the Center for Advanced Materials CAM at Qatar University Faculty members train and mentor the students and help develop and enhance their critical thinking problem-solving and teamwork skills   not in citation given Efficacy edit In   a meta-analysis of the literature on teaching effectiveness in higher education was undertaken   The study noted concerns from higher education politicians and business that higher education was failing to meet society's requirements for well-educated citizens It concluded that although faculty may aspire to develop students' thinking skills in practice they have tended to aim at facts and concepts utilizing lowest levels of cognition rather than developing intellect or values In a more recent meta-analysis researchers reviewed   quasi- or true-experimental studies all of which used some form of standardized critical thinking measure to assess the outcome variable   The authors describe the various methodological approaches and attempt to categorize the differing assessment tools which include standardized tests and second-source measures tests developed by teachers tests developed by researchers and tests developed by teachers who also serve the role as the researcher The results emphasized the need for exposing students to real-world problems and the importance in encouraging open dialogue within a supportive environment Effective strategies for teaching critical thinking are thought to be possible in a wide variety of educational settings   Importance in academia edit Critical thinking is an important element of all professional fields and academic disciplines by referencing their respective sets of permissible questions evidence sources criteria etc Within the framework of scientific skepticism the process of critical thinking involves the careful acquisition and interpretation of information and use of it to reach a well-justified conclusion The concepts and principles of critical thinking can be applied to any context or case but only by reflecting upon the nature of that application Critical thinking forms therefore a system of related and overlapping modes of thought such as anthropological thinking sociological thinking historical thinking political thinking psychological thinking philosophical thinking mathematical thinking chemical thinking biological thinking ecological thinking legal thinking ethical thinking musical thinking thinking like a painter sculptor engineer business person etc In other words though critical thinking principles are universal their application to disciplines requires a process of reflective contextualization   However even with knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning mistakes can happen due to a thinker's inability to apply the methods or because of character traits such as egocentrism Critical thinking includes identification of prejudice bias propaganda self-deception distortion misinformation etc   Given research in cognitive psychology some educators believe that schools should focus on teaching their students critical thinking skills and cultivation of intellectual traits   Critical thinking skills can be used to help nurses during the assessment process Through the use of critical thinking nurses can question evaluate and reconstruct the nursing care process by challenging the established theory and practice Critical thinking skills can help nurses problem solve reflect and make a conclusive decision about the current situation they face Critical thinking creates \"new possibilities for the development of the nursing knowledge \"   Due to the sociocultural environmental and political issues that are affecting healthcare delivery it would be helpful to embody new techniques in nursing Nurses can also engage their critical thinking skills through the Socratic method of dialogue and reflection This practice standard is even part of some regulatory organizations such as the College of Nurses of Ontario Professional Standards for Continuing Competencies     It requires nurses to engage in Reflective Practice and keep records of this continued professional development for possible review by the College Critical thinking is also considered important for human rights education for toleration The Declaration of Principles on Tolerance adopted by UNESCO in   affirms that \"education for tolerance could aim at countering factors that lead to fear and exclusion of others and could help young people to develop capacities for independent judgement critical thinking and ethical reasoning \"   Critical thinking is used as a way of deciding whether a claim is true partially true or false It is a tool by which one can come about reasoned conclusions based on a reasoned process Critical thinking in computer-mediated communication edit The advent and rising popularity of online courses has prompted some to ask if computer-mediated communication CMC promotes hinders or has no effect on the amount and quality of critical thinking in a course relative to face-to-face communication There is some evidence to suggest a fourth more nuanced possibility that CMC may promote some aspects of critical thinking but hinder others For example Guiller et al     found that relative to face-to-face discourse online discourse featured more justifications while face-to-face discourse featured more instances of students expanding on what others had said The increase in justifications may be due to the asynchronous nature of online discussions while the increase in expanding comments may be due to the spontaneity of real time discussion Newman et al     showed similar differential effects They found that while CMC boasted more important statements and linking of ideas it lacked novelty The authors suggest that this may be due to difficulties participating in a brainstorming-style activity in an asynchronous environment Rather the asynchrony may promote users to put forth considered thought out contributions Researchers assessing critical thinking in online discussion forums often employ a technique called Content Analysis     where the text of online discourse or the transcription of face-to-face discourse is systematically coded for different kinds of statements relating to critical thinking For example a statement might be coded as Discuss ambiguities to clear them up or Welcoming outside knowledge as positive indicators of critical thinking Conversely statements reflecting poor critical thinking may be labeled as Sticking to prejudice or assumptions or Squashing attempts to bring in outside knowledge The frequency of these codes in CMC and face-to-face discourse can be compared to draw conclusions about the quality of critical thinking Searching for evidence of critical thinking in discourse has roots in a definition of critical thinking put forth by Kuhn     which emphasizes the social nature of discussion and knowledge construction There is limited research on the role of social experience in critical thinking development but there is some evidence to suggest it is an important factor For example research has shown that 3- to 4-year-old children can discern to some extent the differential creditability   and expertise   of individuals Further evidence for the impact of social experience on the development of critical thinking skills comes from work that found that 6- to 7-year-olds from China have similar levels of skepticism to 10- and 11-year-olds in the United States   If the development of critical thinking skills was solely due to maturation it is unlikely we would see such dramatic differences across cultures   edit Logic portal Age of Enlightenment Cognitive bias mitigation Critical theory Demarcation problem Dialectic Discourse analysis

 navigation search Not to be confused with Content management or Information management Knowledge management KM is the process of creating sharing using and managing the knowledge and information of an organisation   It refers to a multidisciplinary approach to achieving organisational objectives by making the best use of knowledge   An established discipline since   KM includes courses taught in the fields of business administration information systems management library and information sciences     Other fields may contribute to KM research including information and media computer science public health and public policy   Several universities offer dedicated master's degrees in knowledge management Many large companies public institutions and non-profit organisations have resources dedicated to internal KM efforts often as a part of their business strategy IT or human resource management departments   Several consulting companies provide advice regarding KM to these organisations   Knowledge management efforts typically focus on organisational objectives such as improved performance competitive advantage innovation the sharing of lessons learned integration and continuous improvement of the organisation   These efforts overlap with organisational learning and may be distinguished from that by a greater focus on the management of knowledge as a strategic asset and on encouraging the sharing of knowledge     KM is an enabler of organisational learning     Contents   History   Research     Dimensions     Strategies     Motivations   KM technologies   Legal knowledge management       References     History edit Knowledge management efforts have a long history including on-the-job discussions formal apprenticeship discussion forums corporate libraries professional training and mentoring programs     With increased use of computers in the second half of the 20th century specific adaptations of technologies such as knowledge bases expert systems information repositories group decision support systems intranets and computer-supported cooperative work have been introduced to further enhance such efforts   In   the term personal knowledge management was introduced it refers to the management of knowledge at the individual level   In the enterprise early collections of case studies recognised the importance of knowledge management dimensions of strategy process and measurement     Key lessons learned include people and the cultural norms which influence their behaviors are the most critical resources for successful knowledge creation dissemination and application cognitive social and organisational learning processes are essential to the success of a knowledge management strategy and measurement benchmarking and incentives are essential to accelerate the learning process and to drive cultural change   In short knowledge management programs can yield impressive benefits to individuals and organisations if they are purposeful concrete and action-orientated Research edit KM emerged as a scientific discipline in the early 1990s   It was initially supported by individual practitioners when Skandia hired Leif Edvinsson of Sweden as the world's first Chief Knowledge Officer CKO   Hubert Saint-Onge formerly of CIBC Canada started investigating KM long before that   The objective of CKOs is to manage and maximise the intangible assets of their organisations   Gradually CKOs became interested in practical and theoretical aspects of KM and the new research field was formed   The KM idea has been taken up by academics such as Ikujiro Nonaka Hitotsubashi University Hirotaka Takeuchi Hitotsubashi University Thomas H Davenport Babson College and Baruch Lev New York University     In   Thomas A Stewart former editor at Fortune magazine and subsequently the editor of Harvard Business Review published a cover story highlighting the importance of intellectual capital in organisations   The KM discipline has been gradually moving towards academic maturity   First is a trend toward higher cooperation among academics single-author publications are less common Second the role of practitioners has changed   Their contribution to academic research declined from 30% of overall contributions up to   to only 10% by     Third the number of academic knowledge management journals has been steadily growing currently reaching   outlets   Multiple KM disciplines exist approaches vary by author and school     As the discipline matured academic debates increased regarding theory and practice including Techno-centric with a focus on technology ideally those that enhance knowledge sharing and creation     Organisational with a focus on how an organisation can be designed to facilitate knowledge processes best   Ecological with a focus on the interaction of people identity knowledge and environmental factors as a complex adaptive system akin to a natural ecosystem     Regardless of the school of thought core components of KM roughly include people/culture processes/structure and technology The details depend on the perspective   KM perspectives include community of practice   social network analysis   intellectual capital   information theory     complexity science   constructivism     The practical relevance of academic research in KM has been questioned   with action research suggested as having more relevance   and the need to translate the findings presented in academic journals to a practice   Dimensions edit Different frameworks for distinguishing between different 'types of' knowledge exist   One proposed framework for categorizing the dimensions of knowledge distinguishes tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge   Tacit knowledge represents internalised knowledge that an individual may not be consciously aware of such as to accomplish particular tasks At the opposite end of the spectrum explicit knowledge represents knowledge that the individual holds consciously in mental focus in a form that can easily be communicated to others     The Knowledge Spiral as described by Nonaka & Takeuchi Ikujiro Nonaka proposed a model SECI for Socialization Externalization Combination Internalization which considers a spiraling interaction between explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge   In this model knowledge follows a cycle in which implicit knowledge is 'extracted' to become explicit knowledge and explicit knowledge is 're-internalised' into implicit knowledge   Hayes and Walsham   describe knowledge and knowledge management as two different perspectives   The content perspective suggests that knowledge is easily stored because it may be codified while the relational perspective recognises the contextual and relational aspects of knowledge which can make knowledge difficult to share outside the specific context in which it is developed   Early research suggested that KM needs to convert internalised tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge to share it and the same effort must permit individuals to internalise and make personally meaningful any codified knowledge retrieved from the KM effort     Subsequent research suggested that a distinction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge represented an oversimplification and that the notion of explicit knowledge is self-contradictory   Specifically for knowledge to be made explicit it must be translated into information i e symbols outside our heads     More recently together with Georg von Krogh and Sven Voelpel Nonaka returned to his earlier work in an attempt to move the debate about knowledge conversion forward     A second proposed framework for categorizing knowledge dimensions distinguishes embedded knowledge of a system outside a human individual e g an information system may have knowledge embedded into its design from embodied knowledge representing a learned capability of a human body's nervous and endocrine systems   A third proposed framework distinguishes between the exploratory creation of \"new knowledge\" i e innovation vs the transfer or exploitation of \"established knowledge\" within a group organisation or community     Collaborative environments such as communities of practice or the use of social computing tools can be used for both knowledge creation and transfer   Strategies edit Knowledge may be accessed at three stages before during or after KM-related activities   Organisations have tried knowledge capture incentives including making content submission mandatory and incorporating rewards into performance measurement plans   Considerable controversy exists over whether such incentives work and no consensus has emerged   One strategy to KM involves actively managing knowledge push strategy     In such an instance individuals strive to explicitly encode their knowledge into a shared knowledge repository such as a database as well as retrieving knowledge they need that other individuals have provided codification   Another strategy involves individuals making knowledge requests of experts associated with a particular subject on an ad hoc basis pull strategy     In such an instance expert individual s provide insights to requestor personalisation   Hansen et al defined the two strategies   Codification focuses on collecting and storing codified knowledge in electronic databases to make it accessible   Codification can therefore refer to both tacit and explicit knowledge   In contrast personalization encourages individuals to share their knowledge directly   Information technology plays a less important role as it is only facilitates communication and knowledge sharing Other knowledge management strategies and instruments for companies include       Knowledge sharing fostering a culture that encourages the sharing of information based on the concept that knowledge is not irrevocable and should be shared and updated to remain relevant Storytelling as a means of transferring tacit knowledge Cross-project learning Make knowledge-sharing as a key roles in employees' job description After-action reviews Knowledge mapping a map of knowledge repositories within a company accessible by all Communities of practice Expert directories to enable knowledge seeker to reach to the experts Expert systems knowledge seeker responds to one or more specific questions to reach knowledge in a repository Best practice transfer Knowledge fairs Competence management systematic evaluation and planning of competences of individual organisation members Proximity & architecture the physical situation of employees can be either conducive or obstructive to knowledge sharing Master apprentice relationship Mentor-mentee relationship Job-shadowing Collaborative software technologies wikis shared bookmarking blogs social software etc Knowledge repositories databases bookmarking engines etc Measuring and reporting intellectual capital a way of making explicit knowledge for companies Knowledge brokers some organisational members take on responsibility for a specific \"field\" and act as first reference on a specific subject Inter-project knowledge transfer Intra-organizational knowledge sharing Inter-organizational knowledge sharing Motivations edit Multiple motivation s lead organisations to undertake KM   Typical considerations include   Making available increased knowledge content in the development and provision of products and services Achieving shorter development cycles Facilitating and managing innovation and organisational learning Leveraging expertise s across the organisation Increasing network connectivity between internal and external individuals Managing business environments and allowing employees to obtain relevant insights and ideas appropriate to their work Solving intractable or wicked problems Managing intellectual capital and assets in the workforce such as the expertise and know-how possessed by key individuals or stored in repositories KM technologies edit Knowledge management KM technology can be categorised Groupware Software that facilitates collaboration and sharing of organisational information One of the earliest successful products in this category was Lotus Notes it provided tools for threaded discussions document sharing organisation-wide uniform email etc Workflow systems Systems that allow the representation of processes associated with the creation use and maintenance of organisational knowledge For example the process to create and utilise forms and documents Content management and document management systems Software systems that automate the process of creating web content and/or documents Roles such as editors graphic designers writers and producers can be explicitly modeled along with the tasks in the process and validation criteria Commercial vendors started either to support documents e g Documentum or to support web content e g Interwoven but as the Internet grew these functions merged and vendors now perform both functions Enterprise portals Software that aggregates information across the entire organisation or for groups such as project teams e g Microsoft SharePoint eLearning Software that enables organisations to create customised training and education This can include lesson plans monitoring progress and online classes Planning and scheduling software Software that automates schedule creation and maintenance e g Microsoft Outlook The planning aspect can integrate with project management software such as Microsoft Project   Telepresence Software that enables individuals to have virtual \"face-to-face\" meetings without assembling at one location Videoconferencing is the most obvious example These categories overlap Workflow for example is a significant aspect of a content or document management systems most of which have tools for developing enterprise portals     Proprietary KM technology products such as Lotus Notes defined proprietary formats for email documents forms etc The Internet drove most vendors to adopt Internet formats Open-source and freeware tools for the creation of blogs and wikis now enable capabilities that used to require expensive commercial tools     KM is driving the adoption of tools that enable organisations to work at the semantic level   as part of the Semantic Web   for example the Stanford Prot g Ontology Editor Some commentators have argued that after many years the Semantic Web has failed to see widespread adoption       while other commentators have argued that it has been a success   Legal knowledge management edit Knowledge management in law firms has evolved through three phases   Phase one focused primarily on the development of taxonomies to systematize attorney work product and related research The second phase focused on enterprise search to mine the growing volume of information managed by law firms Legal industry specific search engines were deployed by many AmLaw   law firms during this phase Phase   was driven by changes in the legal market place and growing competition that led to price pressure and

information more easily and through personalized views Some portal solutions today are able to integrate legacy applications objects from other portals & handle thousands of user requests In a corporate enterprise environment it is also known as an enterprise portal Contents   History   Main features   Advantages   Disadvantages   Activities   Notable software tools       References     History edit Corporate intranets began gaining popularity during the 1990s As intranets quickly grew more complex the concept of intranet portal was born Today intranet portals provide value-added capabilities such as managing workflows increasing collaboration between work groups and allowing content creators to self-publish their information One typical example of a web platform used to build and host an intranet is Microsoft Sharepoint which is used by 46% of organizations   It provides a lot of features necessary for collaboration integration and customization Main features edit Integration Ability to integrate with your current tools or the possibility of adding new tools You have your outlook calendar and email integrated within intranet Security Enable user or group based security to secure documents and sites throughout the intranet portal Customization Software that is flexible to allow for organization Web Parts can be used to create custom modules which can make interaction easier with the site Ability for users to customize tools and resources they use most often Collaboration People are now able to collaborate their work with each other Example would be multiple people working on one document Communication Channels Allows corporations to promote corporate culture and present information in a more interactive way than before Automation Things like workflows and templates can automate specific document creation Alerts can be created to help learn of changes and new additions to the intranet Applications Links to applications for associates to perform duties User Friendly Application must be easy to use and understand due to a wide range of technical abilities Remote Access Ability for users to access content away from the office Document Repository Ability to store and retrieve document information while maintaining regular backups to prevent data loss Blog Used as a method to provide more timely information to employees customers and business partners People Search Search enterprise wide for employee information such as contact information specialty areas group membership personal interest etc Enterprise Search search enterprise content using enterprise search Targeted Content Business portal administrators can target content by business group area e g HR Marketing Legal Corporate Executives etc Advantages edit Intranet portal helps employees make better and more informed decisions which result from increased knowledge It also helps reduce costs saves time increases collaboration increases productivity and effectiveness Intranet portal can help employees find information more easily and perform their jobs better though few portal designs are optimal just out-of-the-box In fact especially in smaller companies designers can realize some features found in off-the-shelf portal software through simpler do-it-yourself means Most intranets have become completely unwieldy and present a highly fragmented and confusing user experience with no consistency and little navigational support Portals aim to correct this problem by presenting a single gateway to all corporate information and services One benefit of creating this consistent look and feel is users need less time to learn how to use the environment They also more easily recognize where they are in the portal and where they can go no small feat when navigating a large information space By integrating services and presenting personalized snippets on the initial screen intranet portals also reduce the need for users to browse far and wide to obtain needed information thus making it easier for them to perform their jobs   Intranet portal is a Web-based tool that allows users to create a customized site that dynamically pulls in Internet activities and desired content into a single page By providing a contextual framework for information portals can bring S&T Science and Technology and organizational \"knowledge\" to the desktop   Disadvantages edit Intranet Portals can be a large business cost The maintenance and management can be time consuming and expensive Not only is it a cost to keep the portal running but a cost when the system goes offline Most intranets are established to put all an organization's resources into one place and having that offline can force operations to be put on hold Security issues can become an ongoing problem Unauthorized access is a concern and can result in users gaining access to sensitive information Denial of access can cause issues for users needing access for their work Having everything in one place is only good if it's organized Information overload can make finding information very difficult - lowering productivity   Activities edit Tools & Resources Area for

A useful starting point is to note that community film entails collaborative discourses       and co-operative approaches   rather than the primacy of individual self-expression which some critics have stated to be drivers for growth of entertainment-driven social media The kind of cyber-scepticism in Evgeny Morozov's The Net Delusion   appears to be more around social networking and whether it has the genuine potential to change civil and political life The emphasis in some quarters on the value and impact of collaborative creativity or \"mass innovation\"   is a more productive starting point for the discussion of the future impact of community projects in interactive digital contexts The emphasis on community does not entail that the individual does not have a valued role or lose his or her identity The positive dimension suggests that the individual grows by virtue of community interaction At best collaborative film work balances speaking and listening creating and criticizing Scoping the field edit Community film need not be understood as a minority interest recent work points to the mass-market evidence of community filmmaking available on websites such as YouTube and other platforms   Critical opinion on the \"value\" of Community media such as film is likely to remain divided across the spectrum for political and professional reasons In the past research on community film has also been hampered by the local highly specific and ephemeral nature of the productions or by the sense that the participatory process was what mattered rather than a lasting product available for distribution A broader issue for researchers has been that the collective activities of small groups which are loosely organized falls \"under the radar\" in research studies of the third sector civil society   In other examples such as \"underground\" film making the desire may be to avoid mainstream visibility Others make a virtue of lack of resources available for projects by celebrating film making as \"indie\" \"guerilla\" \"DIY\" \"low budget\" or even \"no-budget \" Against amateurs edit In some quarters there has been open hostility to the amateur aspects of social media In his book The Cult of the Amateur Andrew Keen asserts that \"Out of this anarchy it suddenly became clear that what was governing the infinite monkeys now inputting away on the Internet was the law of digital Darwinism the survival of the loudest and most opinionated Under these rules the only way to intellectually prevail is by infinite filibustering \"   Perhaps by insisting on the value of working together \"Community film\" claims to contribute to working against \"undesirable\" tendencies of lone attention-seeking individuals See also the notes on industry skills and professionalization below Problems with collaborative approaches to film making edit In participatory video methodology it is common to work with all participants as equal producers The equal status of collaborators runs risks and has drawbacks that are symptomatic of all collaborative ventures It may be idealistic or impractical for instance to assume that everyone could have an equal contribution throughout the film making process Collective decision making can become intractable and lead to ineffective and temporary compromises There is a continuing problem of how to address a variety of dissenting or minority opinions Collective action may lead to unreconciled positions and a lack of direction or an inability to establish aesthetic coherence Mixed forms of collaboration edit In mixed collaboration a leadership role for a curator or director may be created in order to select and piece together a variety of contributions from a wider community An example of Director s assembling and arranging a variety of community-generated films into one cohesive production is Kevin Macdonald and Joseph Michael's Life in a Day - a documentary film project born out of a partnership between YouTube Ridley Scott Associates and LG electronics   Community film popular culture and mass media edit Although there is the sense in \"community film\" and \" Community media \" debates of a critical attitude to \"entertainment\" as unthinking escapism and to \"star culture\" as celebrity some academics have proposed a more defensive or celebratory inclusiveness in critical responses   Also in popular social media for instance more is being understood about the participatory nature of fan groups even where that interactivity is being shaped top-down by celebrities and their agents     \"Community film\" draws on the democratic and participatory potential of new technology which has decreased the cost of entry for new film makers new distributors and wider more interactive audiences In the hands of a growing number of activists film has become a tool for community building diversity and resistance   Taking the argument further the traditional power triangle of film maker-distributor-spectator can also be challenged and opened up On the other hand the public display of filmed protest movements may leave participants open to identification by those who seek to oppress them Discursive functions and the problem of representation edit As a global phenomenon \"community film\" claims to respect the integrity and identity of the local community and importantly dialogues between local groups against the perceived homogenization of the dominant transnational industries that seek to erase distinctive voices in order to create their international products and brands In that regard the discourses and practices associated with community film claim to be decolonizing and post-colonial Some academic critics on the other hand have disputed whether documentary and ethnographic film can or ought? to be neutral   In its storytelling role \"Community film\" runs the risk of being partisan or serving the interests of one group against another Conferences festivals and online platforms provide useful opportunities to discuss issues of fair representation evidence and objectivity In that regard social media helps to critique what would otherwise or in former times have been rather isolated productions Organizational practice and methodology edit As an example of organizational practice and methodology \"Community film\" draws on and emphasizes the collaborative nature of film making The focus is on co-operation and teamwork rather than the self the ego the auteur and the hierarchy that dominates mainstream cinema Community film exponents believe that by employing more collectivist approaches than the \"industry\" their work may be liberating for communities and may also develop creativity rather than holding it back Working with young people Steve Goodman has noted that a video camera provides \"a critical lens through which they can explore the world around them It helps them to defamiliarize the familiar taken for granted conditions of life \"   p   Sustainability advocacy and activism edit Exponents of community film suggest that it encompasses a range of sustainable tools and emerging tool kits for the creative liberation of citizens and the planet Accordingly more political perspectives on \"community film\" engage directly with film as a form of advocacy and activism human rights and more broadly \"video for change\"   Increasingly real or 'authentic' community faces and voices are used in film by organizations wishing to demonstrate evidence for their work or the relevance and significance of the issues presented by the participants Against the mainstream edit A survey by whom? of community films presented at festivals and conferences suggests major differences from traditional notions of \"film\" defined as fictional   minutes' duration big budget commercial entertainment market-driven product Accordingly some community films as products of artist-collectives embrace avant-garde experimentation as well as process-driven approaches Like community media community film often sees itself at odds with the dominant modes of top-down celebrity-driven merchandising-dependent and consumption-driven models By working on a smaller scale than the global film industry it is claimed by whom? that \"community film\" combats the specialization and alienation that big-budget films incorporate as a business practice model In \"community film\" as in participatory video the individual will have the opportunity to undertake a variety of roles and to learn a range of skills Formal qualifications and traditional film industry experience are not required although participants will often be guided initially by those with acquired technical and film project skills   Community film places a greater emphasis on a willingness to learn to experiment and to take creative risks Another set of approaches can be understood as a development of applied critical theory   Critical comparisons with related fields edit Community film embraces and celebrates social documentary and political film approaches but does not confine itself to seeking participatory solutions to a specific social problem It differs from participatory video   methodologies such as the \"Fogo Process\" where the approaches are better understood in terms of social science models of instrumental engagement which are outcome-focussed or more ethnographic visual methodologies Community film appears to be anti-methodological and suspicious of utopian goals or notions of aesthetic perfectibility Websites that promote community film embrace DIY or Do-It-Together approaches the cult of the amateur or the notion of punk Underground or 'Open' Screenings may happen alongside musical and other forms of performance A traditional cinema is not required festivals may also be virtual being presented as online with community volunteers acting as curators or judges Drawing on other discourses and practices edit Community film constitutes a broader field than a specific participatory video methodology by incorporating a wider range of community development practices and modes of facilitation Furthermore \"Community film\" learns from related fields such as applied drama   process drama improvisation theatre for development and creative approaches to education such as preferred learning styles and multiple intelligence   Training and development edit Any organized group or loose association of individuals coming together to make watch and discuss film constitutes \"community film\" in action Traditional notions of the trained professional crew the film set scripts and acting skills are not essential to the \"community film\" practice The critical attitude to an enshrined professional guild and educational class comes through from the work of Ivan Illich   and more broadly Henry Giroux and Critical pedagogy Future edit Similarly examples of current work in the field shows that community film does not require traditional large scale cinema distribution Community film is a movement to occupy screens anywhere and everywhere that the traditional film industry does not have a monopoly But the weaknesses of community television in many parts of the world and the stranglehold of global commercial satellite providers suggests that community film is a weak force at present However additional channels have sometimes provided opportunities for screening of new video work emerging from the community and non profit sectors of civil society One example is the British Community Channel In the UK future licences are planned in the field of locally grown TV news current affairs and magazine style programmes \"The Government is committed to decentralising broadcasting to increase localisation \"   Further advances in the community film field are likely to spring from advances in technology and software such as collaborative editing further exploration of interactivity better understanding and use of wiki-discourses and practices improved bandwidth and infrastructure Social and educational roles edit Community film operates on two interlocking levels visual/media literacy and digital media participation In line with the UNESCO McBride deliberations it asserts that these are basic human rights The first implies an ability to interrogate and discuss film and other media rather than to be shaped as a passive consumer of the entertainment industry The second entails opportunities for ownership of the means of production Furthermore community film argues that active participation informs and alters literacy It asserts that it does not make sense to have one without the other Would we according to whom? tolerate a culture's claims to freedom and citizenship in which the majority reads but only a minority is empowered to write?

"Collaborative innovation network     navigation search Collaborative innovation is a process in which multiple players within and outside an organization contribute towards creating and developing new products services processes and business solutions It might include the involvement of customers suppliers and multiple stakeholders such as agencies and consultants   Usually firms that promote open forms of collaboration benefit from having access to different capabilities and knowledge enhancing their competitiveness and accelerating their innovation process On one hand it enables small companies such as start-ups to partner with other players complementing each other and taking advantage of different perspectives and resources On the other hand it helps large companies to speed-up their innovation process and time-to-market overcoming bureaucracy and inflexible procedures   Collaboration can occur in all aspects of the business cycle depending on the context Procurement and supplier collaboration Research and development of new products services and technologies Marketing distribution and commercialization Collaborative innovation network CoIN is a type of collaborative innovation practice that makes use of the internet platforms such as email chat social networks blogs and Wikis to promote communication and innovation within self-organizing virtual teams The difference is that people that collaborate in CoIN are so intrinsically motivated that might not be paid nor get any advantage Thus a CoIN is a social construct with a huge potential for innovation It has been defined by the originator of the term Peter Gloor from MIT Sloan's Center for Collective Intelligence as \"a cyberteam of self- motivated people with a collective vision enabled by the Web to collaborate in achieving a common goal by sharing ideas information and work\" Indeed CoIN is a type of open collaboration that helps organizations to become more creative productive and efficient By adopting CoIN as part of their culture these companies accelerate innovation uncover hidden business opportunities reduce costs and enhance synergies They not only can engage employees from every level of hierarchy towards a common project discovering new talents and promoting direct relation between employees but also partner with external parties Similar is the concept of the \"Self-Organizing Innovation Network\" it has been described by author Robert Rycroft of the Elliott School of International Affairs of George Washington University Contents   Overview   Examples   Collaborative innovation network factors   Current challenges   Future       References   Further reading     Overview edit CoINs feature internal transparency and direct communication Members of a COIN collaborate and share knowledge directly with each other rather than through hierarchies They come together with a shared vision because they are intrinsically motivated to do so and seek to collaborate in some way to advance an idea CoINs work across hierarchies and boundaries in which members can directly and openly exchange ideas and information This collaborative and transparent environment fosters innovation Gloor describes phenomenon as \"swarm creativity\" According to him \"COINs are the best engines to drive innovation\"   CoINs existed well before the advent of modern communication technology However internet and instant communication improved productivity and enabled the reach of a global scale Today they rely on Internet e-mail and other communications vehicles for information sharing   According to Peter Gloor   CoINs have   main characteristics Dispersed Membership technology allows members to be spread over the world Regardless of the location members share a common goal and are convinced of their common cause Interdependent Membership cooperation between members is key to achieve common goal The work of one member is affected and interdependent on the others' work No simple chain of command there is no superior command It is a decentralized and self-organized system Conflicts are solved without the need of a hierarchy or authority Work towards a common goal members are willing to contribute work and share freely They are intrinsically motivated to donate their work create and share knowledge in favor of a common goal Dependence on trust cooperative behavior and mutual trust is needed to work efficiently within the network Members act accordingly to an ethical code that states the rules and principles to be followed by all members Usually ethical codes include principles related to respect consistency reciprocity and rationality There also are five essential elements of collaborative innovation networks what Gloor calls as \" genetic code \"     They are learning networks they set an informal and flexible environment which facilitates and stimulates collaboration and the exchange of ideas information and knowledge   They need an ethical code they agree on an ethical code that guides the conduct and behavior of the members   They are based on trust and self-organization members trust each other without the need of a centralized management They are brought together by mutual respect and strong sense of shared beliefs   They make knowledge accessible to everyone CoINs nurture communication to an extent that information shared with everyone Nowadays with internet and social medias their ideas and concepts achieve a global level   They operate in internal honesty and transparency they create a system based on reciprocal trust and mutually established principles Examples edit CoINs have been developing many disruptive innovations such as the Internet Linux the Web and Wikipedia These inventions were created in universities or labs by a group of students with little or no budget They were not focused on the money but on the sense of accomplishment   The Web is the early version of Internet It was driven by a CoIN of intrinsically motivated people that wanted to improve technical development and launch a disruptive solution Their goal was to link mainframes and allow multiple users simultaneously Another contribution was Linux an operating system for personal computing that directly competes with Microsoft It was initially developed by a student called Linus Torvalds and later became an open source software The code is publicly available and anyone can contribute or enhance it The success of Linux is the constant and continuous updating which is done at a much lower cost than closed source software Wikipedia gathers thousands of volunteers that constantly write and update content Although it does not have a hierarchy nor a central authority the entries are mostly accurate and complete Volunteers share a strong feeling of community and willingness to contribute towards knowledge without being paid for it Faced with these creations large companies such as IBM and Intel have learnt to use the principles of open innovation to enhance their research learning curve They increased or established collaborations with universities agencies and small companies to accelerate their processes and launch new services faster   Collaborative innovation network factors edit Asheim and Isaksen     conclude that innovative network contribute to the achievement of optimal allocation of resources and promoting knowledge transfer performance However there are four factors of collaborative innovation network that differentely affect the performance of COINs   Those factors are   network size network size is the number of partners such as enterprises universities research institutions intermediaries and government departments in an innovative network   Previous work reveals that network size has a positive effect on knowledge transfer   as it provide the actor e g firm with two major substantive benefits one is the exposure to a larger amount of external information knowledge and ideas and the other is resource sharing between the actor and its contacts such as knowledge sharing reduction of transaction costs complementarities and scale       network heterogeneity network heterogenity refers to differences in the knowledge technology ability and size of members in the network   Firms in a more heterogeneous network have a higher probability to acquire external knowledge resources   When network heterogeneity is higher getting complementary resources and accelerating the speed of knowledge transfer are easier     network tie-strength Tie-Strength refers to the nature of a relational contact   and includes the degree of intimacy duration and frequency the breadth of topic usually refers to time length tie depth emotional intensity intimacy frequency and interactive connection     A collaborative innovative network with a high level of tie-strength can provide firms with effective information and knowledge reduce risk and uncertainty in the innovation process and achieve successful knowledge transfer     network centrality Network centrality refers to an actor's position in a network Actors centrally located in a network are in an advantageous position to monitor the flow of information and have the consequent advantage of having large numbers of contacts who are willing and able to provide them with important opportunities and resources   Current challenges edit Collaborative innovation still needs to be empowered A more collaborative approach involving stakeholders such as governments corporations entrepreneurs and scholars is key to tackling the main challenges facing today First of all it is still important to raise awareness of CoIN and its benefits among companies and major economic fields Policy makers and corporate leaders could support the development of programs strategies and educational plans to stimulate CoINs in specific sectors benefiting the whole economy

business     navigation search This article needs additional citations for verification Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources Unsourced material may be challenged and removed April   Learn how and when to remove this template message Facilitation in business organizational development OD and in consensus decision-making refers to the process of designing and running a successful meeting Facilitation concerns itself with all the tasks needed to run a productive and impartial meeting Facilitation serves the needs of any group who are meeting with a common purpose whether it be making a decision solving a problem or simply exchanging ideas and information It does not lead the group nor does it try to distract or to entertain A slightly different interpretation focuses more specifically on a group that is engaged in experiential learning   In particular this is associated with active learning and concepts of tutelary authority This is covered in-depth in the research work of John Heron at the University of Surrey and the International Centre for Co-operative Inquiry Contents   Aspects   The role of the facilitator   The form of meeting       References   Further reading Aspects edit The role of the facilitator see below The role of facilitator only emerged as a separate set of skills in the 1980s It has similarities to the traditional Chair or secretary roles in a meeting but goes beyond them to actively participate and guide the group towards consensus Setting ground rules Often disregarded by those untrained in facilitation setting ground rules is a key component of the facilitation process especially in meetings convened to discuss difficult problems or for training These rules are usually reiterated in some form at the outset of a facilitated meeting or workshop to ensure participants understand the various roles being employed and the responsibilities accorded to each Certain aspects feature highly such as being open to suggestions building on what is there not knocking down ideas allowing others space to speak or express themselves mutual respect that the facilitator does not own the topic under discussion and the identity of that owner is clear rules of engagement such as time-outs and procedures that will be adopted how unresolved issues will be captured and dealt with Finally it is key that during the meeting it is clear that the owner of the topic is not expected to intervene to impose ideas beyond setting out parameters for consideration or to give insight The facilitator in this respect owns the process of the meeting These are all closely associated with the idea of facilitation as a tool of workplace empowerment   Consulting with the client A facilitator will work with a client who is someone in an organisation or diverse group who is calling them and has invited the facilitator to assist They will try to understand the purpose and outcome of the meeting by discussing it with the client Making arrangements for the meeting The practical arrangements will be arranged or managed by the facilitator They will also consider in detail the location and layout of the room They will research the meeting beforehand to understand why it is being held and that all stakeholders are invited and able to attend Setting the agenda They will understand in detail how each item on the agenda is to be tackled and how long it should take Using specialist techniques they will allow participants to understand all the issues at stake and all alternative courses of action The Facilitator designs the process agenda based on his or her discussions with the participants and the Facilitator's process expertise Understanding group norms They will not make assumptions about the way people interact and will try to adapt to the ways of different cultures and organisations Understanding group dynamics Whilst tackling the practical aspects of a meeting they remain aware of undercurrents both verbal and non-verbal which may indicate problems the group is having The facilitator may try to assist the group in becoming aware of these The role of the facilitator edit See Facilitator for details of exactly how a facilitator might run a meeting It is important to note that the tasks and responsibilities listed below do not need to be covered by a single facilitator The role of the facilitator is often shared by multiple people for instance one person may arrange the logistics before the meeting another person may keep time and monitor the agenda during the meeting and a third person may be responsible for recording agreements Prior to a meeting facilitators research the meeting find out the purpose and goal if any of the meeting establish who needs to attend draw up a draft agenda and design the group processes to attain the necessary results share the agenda with potential attendees changing it as necessary ensure everyone gets fully briefed for the meeting and that everyone knows the purpose and potential consequences of the meeting During the meeting facilitators monitor the agenda keep time manage the group process encourage participation from all attendees help participants understand different points of view foster solutions that incorporate diverse points of view manage participant behaviour create a safe environment teach new thinking skills and facilitate structured thinking activities record with an agreed phraseology agreements They may also note unresolved issues for later debate The facilitator may write up and publish the results of the meeting to everyone concerned including those who could not attend The form of meeting edit A meeting usually means everyone is together in the same room at the same time and this is the major situation in which facilitation is practiced With the introduction of modern telecommunications the field has grown to embrace other forms of meetings Same time same place The traditional meeting in a room with all parties present at the same time Same time different place The teleconference with either all parties at separate locations or with some in geographically dispersed sub meetings all with audio / video connection Different time same place A meeting focussing on a particular physical location where people contribute as they pass by A wall mounted notice board and/or poster display which allows individuals to add comments as they pass is one example A survey using un-networked computers in a kiosk would also be a \"different time same place\" meeting Different time different place Meeting via a web link such as discussion groups forums blogs and usenet Specialist web-enabled group decision support software exists Wikipedia discussion pages fall into this

Burghardt et al   and the works of Longo et al       all represent examples of implicit collaboration Systems that fall under this category identify similar users queries and links clicked automatically and recommend related queries and links to the searchers Explicit collaboration means that users share an agreed-upon information need and work together toward that goal For example in a chat-like application query terms and links clicked are automatically exchanged The most prominent example of this class is SearchTogether   published in   SearchTogether offers an interface that combines search results from standard search engines and a chat to exchange queries and links Reddy et al     follow a similar approach and compares two implementations of their CSE called MUSE and MUST Reddy et al focuses on the role of communication required for efficient CSEs Representatives for the class of implicit collaboration are I-Spy   the Community Search Assistant   and the CSE of Burghardt et al   Cerciamo   supports explicit collaboration by allowing one person to concentrate on finding promising groups of documents while having the other person make in-depth judgments of relevance on documents found by the first person However in Papagelis et al   terms are used differently they combine explicitly shared links and implicitly collected browsing histories of users to a hybrid CSE Community of practice edit Recent work in collaborative filtering and information retrieval has shown that sharing of search experiences among users having similar interests typically called a community of practice or community of interest reduces the effort put in by a given user in retrieving the exact information of interest   Collaborative search deployed within a community of practice deploys novel techniques for exploiting context during search by indexing and ranking search results based on the learned preferences of a community of users   The users benefit by sharing information experiences and awareness to personalize result-lists to reflect the preferences of the community as a whole The community representing a group of users who share common interests similar professions The best known example is the open-source project ApexKB previously known as Jumper       Depth of mediation edit This refers to the degree that the CSE mediates search   SearchTogether   is an example of UI-level mediation users exchange query results and judgments of relevance but the system does not distinguish among users when they run queries Cerchiamo   and recommendation systems such as I-Spy   keep track of each person's search activity independently and use that information to affect their search results These are examples of deeper algorithmic mediation Task vs trait edit This model classifies people's membership in groups based on the task at hand vs long-term interests these may be correlated with explicit and implicit collaboration   Privacy-aware collaborative search engines edit Search terms and links clicked that are shared among users reveal their interests habits social relations and intentions   In other words CSEs put the privacy of the users at risk Studies have shown that CSEs increase efficiency         Unfortunately by the lack of privacy enhancing technologies a privacy aware user who wants to benefit from a CSE has to disclose their entire search log Note even when explicitly sharing queries and links clicked the whole former log is disclosed to any user that joins a search session Thus sophisticated mechanisms that allow on a more fine grained level which information is disclosed to whom are desirable As CSEs are a new technology just entering the market identifying user privacy preferences and integrating Privacy enhancing technologies PETs into collaborative search are in conflict On one hand PETs have to meet user preferences on the other hand one cannot identify these preferences without using a CSE i e implementing PETs into CSEs Today the only work addressing this problem comes from Burghardt et al   They implemented a CSE with experts from the information system domain and derived the scope of possible privacy preferences in a user study with these experts Results show that users define preferences referring to i their current context e g being at work ii the query content e g users exclude topics from

and Andr Messager wrote a piece for piano four-hands called Souvenir de Bayreuth subtitled Fantaisie en forme de quadrille sur les th mes favoris de L'Anneau Du Nibelung de Richard Wagner It was not published during their lifetimes and appeared in print only in     Electroacoustic music edit Collaboration has been a constant feature of Electroacoustic music due to the complexity of the technology Since the beginning all laboratories and electronic music studios have involved the presence of different individuals with diverse but intertwined competencies In particular the embedding of technological tools into the process of musical creation resulted in the emergence of a new agent with new expertise the musical assistant the technician the tutor the computer music designer the music mediator a profession that has been described and defined in different ways over the years who can work in the phase of writing creating new instruments recording and/or performance   He or she explains the possibilities of the various instruments and applications as well as the potential sound effects to the composer when the latter did not have sufficient knowledge of the programme or a clear idea of what he or she could obtain from it The musical assistant also explains the most recent results in musical research and translates artistic ideas into programming languages Finally he or she transforms those ideas into a score or a computer program and often performs the musical piece during the concerts   Examples of collaboration are numerous Pierre Boulez and Andrew Gerzso Alvise Vidolin and Luigi Nono Jonathan Harvey and Gilbert Nouno among others Composers remain the sole authors of this music works whereas musical assistants are mentioned within the musical documentation scores press program notes as music assistants or computer music designers Other forms of musical collaboration edit Another case of note was that of Eric Fenby who worked as amanuensis for the blind Frederick Delius Delius would dictate the notes and Fenby would transcribe them While Fenby was himself a composer these works on which he and Delius worked together were a collaboration in terms of the labour involved in writing them down but not in terms of the musical ideas which were entirely Delius's own Film scores over the years have tended to be collaborative projects in various ways from the simple matter of orchestrators working with the sketches by the composer to multi-composer collaborative efforts Originally with the studio system composers often contributed parts of a score assigned by the head of the music department Sometimes this was music not specific to that film for lower budget movies In modern times collaboration is seen in such groups as Remote Control Productions True collaboration has also occurred with such varied examples as Bernard Herrmann and Alfred Newman who together composed the music for The Egyptian   and Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard who wrote the music for two Batman films Batman Begins   and The Dark Knight   Transformations edit   Composer tributes classical music There are various cases where a later composer has transformed an existing work or group of works into a new form but this would generally be considered an arrangement by another hand rather than a collaboration Examples of this would include Franz Liszt 's many piano arrangements of symphonies and other works by composers such as Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert Liszt was the most prominent of a great number of composers who arranged the works of others for other combinations of instruments Charles Gounod took the harmonies from Johann Sebastian Bach 's Prelude No   in C major from Book I of The Well-Tempered Clavier and added his own melodic line setting it to the words of the prayer Hail Mary in Latin Ave Maria His setting was called Ave Maria Edvard Grieg wrote additional piano parts for a number of solo piano sonatas by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to be played simultaneously with the original music on piano four-hands Mozart's original score was untouched The resultant work is certainly music by both Mozart and Grieg however they did not collaborate in the ordinary sense of the term Mozart having died   years before Grieg was born Leopold Godowsky 's reworking of Fr d ric Chopin 's tudes by playing two tudes simultaneously or playing in the left hand the music originally written for the right hand and vice versa See Studies on Chopin's tudes Arthur Benjamin took a number of unrelated harpsichord sonatas by Domenico Cimarosa arranged them for oboe and orchestra and grouped them into a work he called \"Oboe Concerto on Themes of Cimarosa\" Concert promoters and record companies often gave it the misleading title \"Oboe Concerto by Cimarosa\" arr Benjamin but in this form it was perhaps more Benjamin's work than Cimarosa's In a similar but slightly different vein Alan Kogosowski arranged three solo piano pieces by Fr d ric Chopin for piano and orchestra and grouped them into a work that he himself gave the misleading title \"Piano Concerto No   in A major by Chopin\" During the Chinese Cultural Revolution a group of six composers including Yin Chengzong rearranged the Yellow River Cantata by Xian Xinghai into a four-movement piano concerto entitled Yellow River Piano Concerto Completions edit   Unfinished creative work Classical music There are also instances where a work was left unfinished at the composer's death and was completed by another composer In such cases the later composer generally strives to ensure the finished product is as close as possible to the original composer's intentions as revealed by their notes rough drafts or other evidence One of the best known examples is the completion by Franco Alfano of Giacomo Puccini 's opera Turandot There may also be a case for describing Sir Edward Elgar 's Symphony No   as a work by both Elgar and Anthony Payne However these types of works cannot properly be called collaborations"},

Learn how and when to remove this template message A Polycom phone made specifically for conference calls A conference call is a telephone call in which someone talks to several people at the same time The conference calls may be designed to allow the called party to participate during the call or the call may be set up so that the called party merely listens into the call and cannot speak It is sometimes called ATC audio tele-conference Conference calls can be designed so that the calling party calls the other participants and adds them to the call however participants are usually able to call into the conference call themselves by dialing a telephone number that connects to a \"conference bridge\" a specialized type of equipment that links telephone lines Companies commonly use a specialized service provider who maintains the conference bridge or who provides the phone numbers and PIN codes that participants dial to access the meeting or conference call These service providers can often dial-out to participants connecting them to call and introducing them to the parties who are on-the-line The operators can also take additional information such as question and answer details and also enable and disable advanced conferencing features such as muting lines muting participants and enabling a recording feature An operator can often be summoned to conference call hosted by a service provider using a combination of keys on a users' sometimes only the moderator telephone keypad The most common recall function is *0 asterisk and the zero/operator key The more limited three-way calling is available usually at an extra charge on home or office phone lines For a three-way call the first called party is dialed Then the hook flash button or recall button is pressed and the other called party 's phone number is dialed While it is ringing flash/recall is pressed again to connect the three people together This option allows callers to add a second outgoing call to an already connected call Contents   Usage     Business     Flat-rate conferencing     Prepaid conference calls     Free conference calling     Premium conferencing   Conferencing in IMS       References Usage edit Business edit Businesses use conference calls daily to meet with remote parties both internally and outside of their company Common applications are client meetings or sales presentations project meetings and updates regular team meetings training classes and communication to employees who work in different locations Conference calling is viewed as a primary means of cutting travel costs and allowing workers to be more productive by not having to go out-of-office for meetings Conference calls are used by nearly all United States public corporations to report their quarterly results These calls usually allow for questions from stock analysts and are called earnings calls A standard conference call begins with a disclaimer stating that anything said in the duration of the call may be a forward-looking statement and that results may vary significantly The CEO CFO or investor relations officer then will read the company's quarterly report Lastly the call is opened for questions from analysts Conference calls are increasingly used in conjunction with web conferences where presentations or documents are shared via the internet This allows people on the call to view content such as corporate reports sales figures and company data presented by one of the participants The main benefit is that the presenter of the document can give clear explanations about details within the document while others simultaneously view the presentation Care should be taken not to mix video and audio source on the same network since the video feed can cause interruptions on sound quality It is important to pay attention to conference call etiquette when participating for example one should refrain from shouting and multitasking in certain cases Care should also be taken to schedule a call at a convenient time Business conference calls are usually hosted or operator-assisted with a variety of features Conference calls are also beginning to cross over into the world of podcasting and social networking which in turn fosters new kinds of interaction patterns Live streaming or broadcasting of conference calls allows a larger audience access to the call without dialing into a bridge In addition organizers of conference calls can publish a dial-in number alongside the audio stream creating potential for audience members to dial in and interact The UK government has changed flexible working rights since   so that employees who have been working full-time for a company or organisation can lawfully request flexible working In recent years there have been a number of different types of flexible working options as a result of conference calling technology enabling employees to work remotely Flat-rate conferencing edit Flat-rate conferencing services are being offered which give unlimited access to a conference bridge at a fixed monthly cost Because telecommunication carriers offer free long-distance bundled with local service this alternative is gaining widespread popularity for budget conscious businesses and non-profits In the UK there are conference services offered on a pay-as-you-go basis where the cost of the phone calls using 0843/0844 or 0871/0872 non-geographic revenue sharing numbers from each of the participants covers the cost of the conference service With this service type there is no monthly charge and usually no contracts to sign Prepaid conference calls edit Prepaid conference call services allow businesses and individuals to purchase conferencing services online and conduct conference calls on a pay-as-you-go basis Typically a conference call PIN and its associated calling instructions are displayed immediately online after being purchased and/or sent via email Generally prepaid conference call services are used with a landline telephone mobile phone or computer and there is no need to buy additional expensive telecommunications hardware or add/switch long distance service Some services allow one to start or join a conference call from virtually any country worldwide with appropriate telephone access Large telecommunications providers such as AT&T Embarq formerly Sprint Verizon and other large to medium conferencing service providers maintain a dominant position in the conferencing niche servicing many of the world's biggest brands However the Internet and improved global VoIP networks have helped to significantly reduce the barrier of entry into this niche Free conference calling edit Free conferencing is different from traditional conference calling in that it has no organizer fees and allows for multiple people to meet for the price of their long distance connections Companies that provide free conference call services are usually compensated through a revenue sharing arrangement with the local phone company sharing the terminating access charge for all incoming calls to a phone carrier Some background on the terminating access charge On every long distance call in the United States including toll conference calls the consumer is paying for origination dial tone transport and termination connecting the call   Each of these phone companies share a piece of the cost of the call If it is the same phone company performing all three tasks most likely the two largest phone companies AT&T and Verizon they keep all of the charge This is known as intercarrier compensation ICC and is intended to keep the telecommunications system functioning by having every phone company receive compensation for using their network In the case of free conference calling the conferencing company strikes an agreement with the local phone company that hosts the conferencing bridge to receive a share of the terminating access charge received for connecting the call At large carriers such as AT&T and Verizon they keep these access charges for their own conferencing services in addition to charging the customer for the conference service With free conference calling as mentioned above there are no organizer fees so these services do not double-dip the consumer pays for a regular call with the same three components origination transport and termination of any call In other words the call costs the same as any other call under the customer's calling plan but the conferencing is included for free to the host and participants of the conference call This added competition in the conferencing market has brought average rates down from over   cents per minute to under   cents per minute In addition it is more efficient and less expensive to speak to many people on one call a conference call than on multiple person-to-person calls In November   the Federal Communications Commission FCC published a 732-page Order on InterCarrier Compensation ICC   including rules governing revenue sharing Citing Section   b   of the Telecommunications Act of   the FCC mandated that terminating access rates for all calls not just conference calls be leveled in   and   then reduced in three increments over the subsequent three years until they reach $0 in     These mostly sub-1 cent charges are replaced with an access recovery charge ARC that is added onto every customers' bill by their phone carriers In other words every phone company will get to keep the terminating access charges they had to pay out to connect each call while charging consumers more whether they make calls or not This order has been challenged at the Federal Appeals Court by several parties   As for revenue sharing the order adds a measure for high volume call traffic which triggers an immediate terminating access charge reduction to the lowest rate of any carrier in that state   In the United Kingdom the   prefix was originally used by UK-based free conference calling providers in order to receive a rebate from every call from a telephone company that owns the number However in April   Ofcom the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications industries announced that the rebate that is payable to the telecom's supplier when an   number is used would be removed   Systems were soon moved to   and   prefixes in order to retain the revenue sharing arrangement Recently in the UK a very small number of conference call providers have begun to use   numbers which are included in bundled minutes under Ofcom regulations   This has provided the option to hold conference calls without any costs whatsoever as call are included in the minutes bundles provided by most UK network operators There is a general trend for companies in the UK to more to   numbers for inbound services because these numbers are more palatable to the caller A distinct difference between sound quality of paid and free conference calls has been noted by customers who have claimed to hear background noises when using the free conferencing services which rarely happens on paid conference calling services   Premium conferencing edit Here participants dial in on a premium-rate number such as a toll free number in the US The conference is typically hosted by the party that perceives value in the call in order to justify the cost this could be a business owner a non-profit board member an educator lawyer or expert in any given field That person then usually pays for the cost of the call Premium conferencing can also be used for charitable fundraisers Premium

Concepts     Central Concepts of Wikinomics in the Enterprise     Coase's Law   Reception       References     Concepts edit According to Tapscott Wikinomics is based on four ideas Openness Peering Sharing and Acting Globally The use of mass collaboration in a business environment in recent history can be seen as an extension of the trend in business to outsource externalize formerly internal business functions to other business entities The difference however is that instead of an organized business body brought into being specifically for a unique function mass collaboration relies on free individual agents to come together and cooperate to improve a given operation or solve a problem This kind of outsourcing is also referred to as crowdsourcing to reflect this difference This can be incentivized by a reward system though it is not required The book also discusses seven new models of mass collaboration including Peering For example page   \" Marketocracy employs a form of peering in a mutual fund Mutual fund MOFQX that harnesses the collective intelligence of the investment community Though not completely open source it is an example of how meritocratic peer-to-peer models are seeping into an industry where conventional wisdom favors the lone super-star stock advisor \"   Ideagoras For example page   linking experts with unsolved research and development problems The company InnoCentive is a consulting group that encapsulates the idea of ideagoras   Prosumers For example page   where it discusses the social video game Second Life as being created by its customers When customers are also the producers you have the phenomenon Prosumer   New Alexandrians This idea is about the Internet and sharing knowledge The last chapter is written by viewers and was opened for editing on February     Central Concepts of Wikinomics in the Enterprise edit According to Tapscott and Williams these four principles are the central concepts of wikinomics in the enterprise Openness which includes not only open standards and content but also financial transparency and an open attitude towards external ideas and resources Peering which replaces hierarchical models with a more collaborative forum Tapscott and Williams cite the development of Linux as the \"quintessential example of peering \" Sharing which is a less proprietary approach to among other things products intellectual property bandwidth scientific knowledge Acting globally which involves embracing globalization and ignoring \"physical and geographical boundaries\" at both the corporate and individual level Coase's Law edit In the chapter The Perfect Storm the authors give an overview of the economic effects of the kind of transactions Web     permits According to the authors Coase's Law see Ronald Coase governs the expansion of a business A firm will tend to expand until the cost of organizing an extra transaction within the firm become equal to the costs of carrying out the same transaction on the open market   However because of the changing usage patterns of Internet technologies the cost of transactions has dropped so significantly that the authors assert that the market is better described by an inversion of Coase's Law That is A firm will tend to expand until the cost of carrying out an extra transaction on the open market become equal to the costs of organizing the same transaction within the firm   Thus the authors think that with the costs of communicating dramatically dropping firms who do not change their current structures will perish Companies who utilize mass collaboration will dominate their respective markets Reception edit A review of this book in the Harvard Business Review states \"like its title the book's prose can fall into breathless hype \"   A review of this book in Choice recommends the book for \"general readers and practitioners \" but cautions that the authors \"present an optimistic overview of successful collaborations and business ventures\" \"use unique terms e g marketocracy prosumption knowledge commons \" should have given \"more consideration to the darker sides of human motivation as well as groupthink and mass mediocrity\" and \"primarily draw on their own observations of businesses and trends for the ideas presented\"   Tapscott and Williams released a followup to Wikinomics titled Macrowikinomics

   References     Definitions edit The term \"crowdsourcing\" was coined in   by Jeff Howe and Mark Robinson editors at Wired to describe how businesses were using the Internet to \"outsource work to the crowd\"   which quickly led to the portmanteau \"crowdsourcing \" Howe first published a definition for the term crowdsourcing in a companion blog post to his June   Wired article \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing\" which came out in print just days later   \"Simply defined crowdsourcing represents the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined and generally large network of people in the form of an open call This can take the form of peer-production when the job is performed collaboratively but is also often undertaken by sole individuals The crucial prerequisite is the use of the open call format and the large network of potential laborers \" In a February     article Daren C Brabham \"the first person to publish scholarly research using the word crowdsourcing\" and writer of the   book Crowdsourcing defined it as an \"online distributed problem-solving and production model \"     Kristen L Guth and Brabham found that the performance of ideas offered in crowdsourcing platforms are affected not only by their quality but also by the communication among users about the ideas and presentation in the platform itself   After studying more than   definitions of crowdsourcing in the scientific and popular literature Enrique Estell s-Arolas and Fernando Gonz lez Ladr n-de-Guevara researchers at the Technical University of Valencia developed a new integrating definition   \"Crowdsourcing is a type of participative online activity in which an individual an institution a nonprofit organization or company proposes to a group of individuals of varying knowledge heterogeneity and number via a flexible open call the voluntary undertaking of a task The undertaking of the task of variable complexity and modularity and in which the crowd should participate bringing their work money knowledge ** and/or ** experience always entails mutual benefit The user will receive the satisfaction of a given type of need be it economic social recognition self-esteem or the development of individual skills while the crowdsourcer will obtain and use to their advantage that which the user has brought to the venture whose form will depend on the type of activity undertaken\" As mentioned by the definitions of Brabham and Estell s-Arolas and Ladr n-de-Guevara above crowdsourcing in the modern conception is an IT-mediated phenomenon meaning that a form of IT is always used to create and access crowds of people     In this respect crowdsourcing has been considered to encompass three separate but stable techniques competition crowdsourcing virtual labor market crowdsourcing and open collaboration crowdsourcing       Henk van Ess a college lecturer in online communications emphasizes the need to \"give back\" the crowdsourced results to the public on ethical grounds His nonscientific noncommercial definition is widely cited in the popular press   \"Crowdsourcing is channeling the experts desire to solve a problem and then freely sharing the answer with everyone \" Despite the multiplicity of definitions for crowdsourcing one constant has been the broadcasting of problems to the public and an open call for contributions to help solve the problem Members of the public submit solutions that are then owned by the entity which originally broadcast the problem In some cases the contributor of the solution is compensated monetarily with prizes or with recognition In other cases the only rewards may be kudos or intellectual satisfaction Crowdsourcing may produce solutions from amateurs or volunteers working in their spare time or from experts or small businesses which were previously unknown to the initiating organization   Another consequence of the multiple definitions is the controversy surrounding what kinds of activities that may be considered crowdsourcing Historical examples edit While the term \"crowdsourcing\" was popularized online to describe Internet-based activities   some examples of projects in retrospect can be described as crowdsourcing Timeline of major events edit   The Longitude Prize When the British government was trying to find a way to

road info and route data based on location such as reports of car accidents or traffic and integrates that data into its routing algorithms for all users of the app Early competitions edit Crowdsourcing has often been used in the past as a competition to discover a solution The French government proposed several of these competitions often rewarded with Montyon Prizes created for poor Frenchmen who had done virtuous acts   These included the Leblanc process or the Alkali prize where a reward was provided for separating the salt from the alkali and the Fourneyron's turbine when the first hydraulic commercial turbine was developed   In response to a challenge from the French government Nicolas Appert won a prize for inventing a new way of food preservation that involved sealing food in air-tight jars   The British government provided a similar reward to find an easy way to determine a ship's longitude in the Longitude Prize During the Great Depression out-of-work clerks

place Olmsted noticed a pattern in the shooting stars Olmsted wrote a brief report of this meteor shower in the local newspaper As the cause of Falling Stars is not understood by meteorologists it is desirable to collect all the facts attending this phenomenon stated with as much precision as possible Olmsted wrote to readers in a report subsequently picked up and pooled to newspapers nationwide Responses came pouring in from many states along with scientists observations sent to the American Journal of Science and Arts   These responses helped him make a series of scientific breakthroughs the major discovery being that meteor showers are seen nationwide and fall from space under the influence of gravity Also they demonstrated that the showers appeared in yearly cycles a fact that often eluded scientists The responses allowed him to suggest a velocity for the meteors although his estimate turned out to be too conservative If he had just taken the responses as presented his conjecture on the meteors' velocity would have been closer to their actual speed A more recent version of crowdsourcing in astronomy is NASA's photo organizing project   which asks internet users to browse photos taken from space and try to identify the location the picture is documenting   In energy system research edit Energy system models require large and diverse datasets increasingly so given the trend towards greater temporal and spatial resolution   In response there have been several initiatives to crowdsource this data Launched in December   OpenEI is a collaborative website run by the US government providing open energy data     While much of its information is from US government sources the platform also seeks crowdsourced input from around the world   The semantic wiki and database Enipedia also publishes energy systems data using the concept of crowdsourced open information Enipedia went live in March           In genealogy research edit Genealogical research was using crowdsourcing techniques long before personal computers were common Beginning in   members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged members to submit information about their ancestors The submitted information was gathered together into a single collection In   to encourage more people to participate in gathering genealogical information about their ancestors the church started the three-generation program In this program church members were asked to prepare documented family group record forms for the first three generations The program was later expanded to encourage members to research at least four generations and became known as the four-generation program   Institutes that have records of interest to genealogical research have used crowds of volunteers to create catalogs and indices to records In genetic genealogy research edit Genetic genealogy is a combination of traditional genealogy with genetics The rise of personal DNA testing after the turn of the century by companies such as Gene by Gene FTDNA GeneTree 23andMe and Ancestry com has led to public and semipublic databases of DNA testing which uses crowdsourcing techniques In recent years citizen science projects have become increasingly focused providing benefits to scientific research       This includes support organization and dissemination of personal DNA genetic testing Similar to amateur astronomy citizen scientists encouraged by volunteer organizations like the International Society of Genetic Genealogy   have provided valuable information and research to the professional scientific community   Spencer Wells director of the Genographic Project blurb Since   the Genographic Project has used the latest genetic technology to expand our knowledge of the human story and its pioneering use of DNA testing to engage and involve the public in the research effort has helped to create a new breed of \"citizen scientist \" Geno     expands the scope for citizen science harnessing the power of the crowd to discover new details of human population history   In journalism edit   Collaborative journalism and Citizen journalism Crowdsourcing is increasingly used in professional journalism Journalists are able to crowdsource information from the crowd typically by fact checking the information and then using the information they've gathered in their articles as they see fit The leading daily newspaper in Sweden has successfully used crowdsourcing in investigating the home loan interest rates in the country in 2013-2014 resulting to over

system in a Finnish bank The bank executive was fired and policy changes followed   TalkingPointsMemo in the United States asked its readers to examine   emails concerning the firing of federal prosecutors in   The British newspaper the Guardian crowdsourced the examination of hundreds of thousands of documents in     In linguistics edit Crowdsourcing strategies have been applied to estimate word knowledge and vocabulary size   In ornithology edit Another early example of crowdsourcing occurred in the field of ornithology On December     Frank Chapman an early officer of the National Audubon Society initiated a tradition dubbed the \"Christmas Day Bird Census\" The project called birders from across North America to count and record the number of birds in each species they witnessed on Christmas Day The project was successful and the records from   different contributors were compiled into one bird census which tallied around   species of birds   This large-scale collection of data constituted an early form of citizen science the premise upon which crowdsourcing is based In the   census more than     individuals participated across     bird count circles   Christmas   marked the National Audubon Society's 115th annual Christmas Bird Count In public policy edit Crowdsourcing public policy and the production of public services is also referred to as citizen sourcing The first conference focusing on Crowdsourcing for Politics and Policy took place at Oxford University under the auspices of the Oxford Internet Institute in   Research has emerged since     that focuses on the use of crowdsourcing for policy purposes     These include the experimental investigation of the use of Virtual Labor Markets for policy assessment   and an assessment of the potential for citizen involvement in process innovation for public administration   Governments across the world are increasingly using crowdsourcing for knowledge discovery and civic engagement Iceland crowdsourced their constitution reform process in   and Finland has crowdsourced several law reform processes to address their off-road traffic laws The Finnish government allowed citizens to go on an online forum to discuss problems and possible resolutions regarding some off-road traffic laws The crowdsourced information and resolutions would then be passed on to legislators for them to refer to when making a decision letting citizens more directly contribute to public policy     The City of Palo Alto is crowdsourcing people's feedback for its Comprehensive City Plan update in a process which started in     The House of Representatives in Brazil has used crowdsourcing in policy-reforms and federal agencies in the United States have used crowdsourcing for several years   In seismology edit The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre EMSC has developed a seismic detection system by monitoring the traffic peaks on its website and by the analysis of keywords used on Twitter   In libraries edit Crowdsourcing is used in libraries for OCR corrections on digitized texts for tagging and for funding   page needed Modern methods edit Currently crowdsourcing has transferred mainly to the Internet which provides a particularly beneficial venue for crowdsourcing since individuals tend to be more open in web-based projects where they are not being physically judged or scrutinized and thus can feel more comfortable sharing This approach ultimately allows for well-designed artistic projects because individuals are less conscious or maybe even less aware of scrutiny towards their work In an online atmosphere more attention can be given to the specific needs of a project rather than spending as much time in communication with other individuals   According to a definition by Henk van Ess   \"The crowdsourced problem can be huge epic tasks like finding alien life or mapping earthquake zones or very small 'where can I skate safely?' Some examples of successful crowdsourcing themes are problems that bug people things that make people feel good about themselves projects that tap into niche knowledge of proud experts subjects that people find sympathetic or any form of injustice \" Crowdsourcing can either take an explicit or an implicit route Explicit crowdsourcing lets users work together to evaluate share and build different specific tasks while implicit crowdsourcing means that users solve a problem as a side effect of something else they are doing With explicit crowdsourcing users can evaluate particular items like books or webpages or share by posting products or items Users can also build artifacts by providing information and editing other people's work Implicit crowdsourcing can take two forms standalone and piggyback Standalone allows people to solve problems as a side effect of the task they are actually doing whereas piggyback takes users' information from a third-party website to gather information   In his   book Crowdsourcing Daren C Brabham puts forth a problem-based typology of crowdsourcing approaches   Knowledge discovery and management is used for information management problems where an organization mobilizes a crowd to find and assemble information It is ideal for creating collective resources Distributed human intelligence tasking is used for information management problems where an organization has a set of information in hand and mobilizes a crowd to process or analyze the information It is ideal for processing large data sets that computers cannot easily do Broadcast search is used for ideation problems where an organization mobilizes a crowd to come up with a solution to a problem that has an objective provable right answer It is ideal for scientific problem solving Peer-vetted creative production is used for ideation problems where an organization mobilizes a crowd to come up with a solution to a problem which has an answer that is subjective or dependent on public support It is ideal for design aesthetic or policy problems Crowdsourcing often allows participants to rank each other's contributions e g in answer to the question \"What is one thing we can do to make Acme a great company?\" One common method for ranking is \"like\" counting where the contribution with the most likes ranks first This method is simple and easy to understand but it privileges early contributions which have more time to accumulate likes In recent years several crowdsourcing companies have begun to use pairwise comparisons backed by ranking algorithms Ranking algorithms do not penalize late contributions They also produce results faster Ranking algorithms have proven to be at least   times faster than manual stack ranking \"Crowdvoting How Elo Limits Disruption\" thevisionlab com May     One drawback however is that ranking algorithms are more difficult to understand than like counting Examples edit x Some common categories of crowdsourcing can be used effectively in the commercial world including crowdvoting crowdsolving crowdfunding microwork creative crowdsourcing crowdsource workforce management and inducement prize contests Although this may not be an exhaustive list the items cover the current major ways in which people use crowds to perform tasks   Crowdvoting edit Crowdvoting occurs when a website gathers a large group's opinions and judgments on a certain topic The Iowa Electronic Market is a prediction market that gathers crowds' views on politics and tries to ensure accuracy by having participants pay money to buy and sell contracts based on political outcomes   Some of the most famous examples have made use of social media channels Domino's Pizza Coca-Cola Heineken and Sam Adams have thus crowdsourced a new pizza bottle design beer and song respectively   Threadless com selects the T-shirts it sells by having users provide designs and vote on the ones they like which are then printed and available for purchase   The California Report Card CRC a program jointly launched in January   by the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society   and Lt Governor Gavin Newsom is an example of modern-day crowd voting Participants access the CRC online and vote on six timely issues Through principal component analysis the users are then placed into an online \"caf \" in which they can present their own political opinions and grade the suggestions of other participants This system aims to effectively involve the greater public in relevant political discussions and highlight the specific topics with which Californians are most concerned Crowdvoting's value in the movie industry was shown when in   a crowd accurately predicting the success or failure of a movie based on its trailer     a feat that was replicated in   by Google   On reddit users collectively rate web content discussions and comments as well as questions posed to persons of interest in \" AMA \" and AskScience online interviews In   Project Fanchise purchased a team in the Indoor Football League and created the Salt Lake Screaming Eagles a fan run team Using a mobile app the fans voted on the day-to-day operations of the team the mascot name signing of players and even the offensive playcalling during games   Crowdsourcing creative work edit Creative crowdsourcing spans sourcing creative projects such as graphic design crowdsourcing architecture apparel design movies   writing company naming   illustration etc     While crowdsourcing competitions have been used for decades in some creative fields such as architecture creative crowdsourcing has proliferated with the recent development of web-based platforms where clients can solicit a wide variety of creative work at lower cost than by traditional means Crowdsourcing in Software Development edit Crowdsourcing approach to software development is used by a number of companies Notable examples are Topcoder and its parent company Wipro       Crowdsourcing language-related data collection edit Crowdsourcing has also been used for gathering language-related data For dictionary work as was mentioned above it was applied over a hundred years ago by the Oxford English Dictionary editors using paper and postage Much later a call for collecting examples of proverbs on a specific topic religious pluralism was printed in a journal   Today as \"crowdsourcing\" has the inherent connotation of being web-based such language-related data gathering is being conducted on the web by crowdsourcing in accelerating ways Currently a number of dictionary compilation projects are being conducted on the web particularly for languages that are not highly academically documented such as for the Oromo language   Software programs have been developed for crowdsourced dictionaries such as WeSay   A slightly different form of crowdsourcing for language data has been the online creation of scientific and mathematical terminology for American Sign Language   Proverb collection is also being done via crowdsourcing on the Web most innovatively for the Pashto language of Afghanistan and Pakistan       Crowdsourcing has been extensively used to collect high-quality gold standard for creating automatic systems in natural language processing e g named entity recognition entity linking   Crowdsolving edit   Crowdsolving Crowdsolving is a collaborative yet holistic way of solving a problem using many people communities groups or resources It is a type of crowdsourcing with focus on complex and intellectively demanding problems requiring considerable effort and quality/ uniqueness of contribution   Crowdsearching edit Chicago-based startup Crowdfind formerly \"crowdfynd\" uses a version of crowdsourcing best termed as crowdsearching which differs from microwork in that no payment for taking part in the search is made   Their platform through geographic location anchoring builds a virtual search party of smartphone and Internet users to find lost items pets or persons as well as returning them TrackR uses a system they call \"crowd GPS\" to load Bluetooth identities to a central server to track lost or stolen items Crowdfunding edit   Crowdfunding Crowdfunding is the process of funding projects by a multitude of people contributing a small amount to attain a certain monetary goal typically via the Internet   Crowdfunding has been used for both commercial and charitable purposes   The crowdfuding model that has been around the longest is rewards-based crowdfunding This model is where people can prepurchase products buy experiences or simply donate While this funding may in some cases go towards helping a business funders are not allowed to invest and become shareholders via rewards-based crowdfunding   Individuals businesses and entrepreneurs can showcase their businesses and projects to the entire world by creating a profile which typically includes a short video introducing their project a list of rewards per donation and illustrations through images The goal is to create a compelling message towards which readers will be drawn Funders make monetary contribution for numerous reasons They connect to the greater purpose of the campaign such as being a part of an entrepreneurial community and supporting an innovative idea or product   They connect to a physical aspect of the campaign like rewards and gains from investment   They connect to the creative display of the campaign s presentation They want to see new products before the public   The dilemma for equity crowdfunding in the US as of   was how the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC is going to regulate the entire process At the time rules and regulations were being refined by the SEC which had until January     to tweak the fundraising methods The regulators were overwhelmed trying to regulate Dodd Frank and all the other rules and regulations involving public companies and the way they trade Advocates of regulation claimed that crowdfunding would open up the flood gates for fraud called it the \"wild west\" of fundraising and compared it to the 1980s days of penny stock \"cold-call cowboys\" The process allows for up to $1 million to be raised without some of the regulations being involved Companies under the then-current proposal would have exemptions available and be able to raise capital from a larger pool of persons which can include lower thresholds for investor criteria whereas the old rules required that the person be an \"accredited\" investor These people are often recruited from social networks where the funds can be acquired from an equity purchase loan donation or ordering The amounts collected have become quite high with requests that are over a million dollars for software such as Trampoline Systems which used it to finance the commercialization of their new software Mobile crowdsourcing edit Mobile crowdsourcing involves activities that take place on smartphones or mobile platforms that are frequently characterized by GPS technology   This allows for real-time data gathering and gives projects greater reach and accessibility However mobile crowdsourcing can lead to an urban bias as well as safety and privacy concerns       Macrowork edit Macrowork tasks typically have these characteristics they can be done independently they take a fixed amount of time and they require special skills Macrotasks could be part of specialized projects or could be part of a large visible project where workers pitch in wherever they have the required skills The key distinguishing factors are that macrowork requires specialized skills and typically takes longer while microwork requires no specialized skills Microwork edit Microwork is a crowdsourcing platform that allows users to do small tasks for which computers lack aptitude for low amounts of money Amazon s popular Mechanical Turk has created many different projects for users to participate in where each task requires very little time and offers a very small amount in payment   The Chinese versions of this commonly called Witkey are similar and include such sites as Taskcn com and k68 cn When choosing tasks since only certain users win users learn to submit later and pick less popular tasks to increase the likelihood of getting their work chosen   An example of a Mechanical Turk project is when users searched satellite images for a boat to find lost researcher Jim Gray   Based on an elaborate survey of participants in a microtask crowdsourcing platform Gadiraju et al have proposed a taxonomy of different types of microtasks that are crowdsourced   Simple projects edit Simple projects are those that require a large amount of time and skills compared to micro and macrowork While an example of macrowork would be writing survey feedback simple projects rather include activities like writing a basic line of code or programming a database which both require a larger time commitment and skill level These projects are usually not found on sites like Amazon Mechanical Turk and are rather posted on platforms like Upwork that call for a specific expertise   Complex projects edit Complex projects generally take the most time have higher stakes and call for people with very specific skills These are generally one-off projects that are difficult to accomplish and can include projects like designing a new product that a company hopes to patent Tasks like that would be complex because design is a meticulous process that requires a large amount of time to perfect and also people doing these projects must have specialized training in design to effectively complete the project These projects usually pay the highest yet are rarely offered   Inducement prize contests edit Web-based idea competitions or inducement prize contests often consist of generic ideas cash prizes and an Internet-based platform to facilitate easy idea generation and discussion An example of these competitions includes an event like IBM's   \"Innovation Jam\" attended by over     international participants and yielding around     ideas     Another example is the Netflix Prize in   The idea was to ask the crowd to come up with a recommendation algorithm more accurate than Netflix's own algorithm It had a grand prize of US$1     and it was given to the BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos team which bested Netflix's own algorithm for predicting ratings by   06% Another example of competition-based crowdsourcing is the   DARPA balloon experiment where DARPA placed   balloon markers across the United States and challenged teams to compete to be the first to report the location of all the balloons A collaboration of efforts was required to complete the challenge quickly and in addition to the competitive motivation of the contest as a whole the winning team MIT in less than nine hours established its own \"collaborapetitive\" environment to generate participation in their team   A similar challenge was the Tag Challenge funded by the US State Department which required locating and photographing individuals in five cities in the US and Europe within   hours based only on a single photograph The winning team managed to locate three suspects by mobilizing volunteers worldwide using a similar incentive scheme to the one used in the balloon challenge   Open innovation platforms are a very effective way of crowdsourcing people's thoughts and ideas to do research and development The company InnoCentive is a crowdsourcing platform for corporate research and development where difficult scientific problems are posted for crowds of solvers to discover the answer and win a cash prize which can range from $10   to $100   per challenge   InnoCentive of Waltham MA and London England provides access to millions of scientific and technical experts from around the world The company claims a success rate of 50% in providing successful solutions to previously unsolved scientific and technical problems IdeaConnection com challenges people to come up with new inventions and innovations and Ninesigma com connects clients with experts in various fields The X Prize Foundation creates and runs incentive competitions offering between $1 million and $30 million for solving challenges Local Motors is another example of crowdsourcing A community of     automotive engineers designers and enthusiasts competes to build off-road rally trucks   Implicit crowdsourcing edit Implicit crowdsourcing is less obvious because users do not necessarily know they are contributing yet can still be very effective in completing certain tasks Rather than users actively participating in solving a problem or providing information implicit crowdsourcing involves users doing another task entirely where a third party gains information for another topic based on the user's actions   A good example of implicit crowdsourcing is the ESP game where users guess what images are and then these labels are used to tag Google images Another popular use of implicit crowdsourcing is through reCAPTCHA which asks people to solve CAPTCHAs to prove they are human and then provides CAPTCHAs from old books that cannot be deciphered by computers to digitize them for the web Like many tasks solved using the Mechanical Turk CAPTCHAs are simple for humans but often very difficult for computers   Piggyback crowdsourcing can be seen most frequently by websites such as Google that data-mine a user's search history and websites to discover keywords for ads spelling corrections and finding synonyms In this way users are unintentionally helping to modify existing systems such as Google's AdWords   Health-care crowdsourcing edit Research has emerged that outlines the use of crowdsourcing techniques in the public health domain     The collective intelligence outcomes from crowdsourcing are being generated in three broad categories of public health care health promotion   health research   and health maintenance   Crowdsourcing also enables researchers to move from small homogeneous groups of participants to large heterogenous groups   beyond convenience samples such as students or higher educated people The SESH group focuses on using crowdsourcing to improve health Crowdsourcing in agriculture edit Crowdsource research also reaches to the field of agriculture This is mainly to give the farmers and experts a kind of help in identification of different types of weeds   from the fields and also to give them the best way to remove the weeds from fields Crowdsourcing in cheating in bridge edit Main articles Cheating in bridge and Boye Brogeland Boye Brogeland initiated a crowdsourcing investigation of cheating by top-level bridge players that showed several players were guilty which led to their suspension   Crowdsourcers edit A number of motivations exist for businesses to use crowdsourcing to accomplish their tasks find solutions for problems or to gather information These include the ability to offload peak demand access cheap labor and information generate better results access a wider array of talent than might be present in one organization and undertake problems that would have been too difficult to solve internally   Crowdsourcing allows businesses to submit problems on which contributors can work on topics such as science manufacturing biotech and medicine with monetary rewards for successful solutions Although crowdsourcing complicated tasks can be difficult simple work tasks can be crowdsourced cheaply and effectively   Crowdsourcing also has the potential to be a problem-solving mechanism for government and nonprofit use   Urban and transit planning are prime areas for crowdsourcing One project to test crowdsourcing's public participation process for transit planning in Salt Lake City was carried out from   to   funded by a U S Federal Transit Administration grant   Another notable application of crowdsourcing to government problem solving is the Peer to Patent Community Patent Review project for the U S Patent and Trademark Office   Researchers have used crowdsourcing systems like the Mechanical Turk to aid their research projects by crowdsourcing some aspects of the research process such as data collection parsing and evaluation Notable examples include using the crowd to create speech and language databases     and using the crowd to conduct user studies   Crowdsourcing systems provide these researchers with the ability to gather large amounts of data Additionally using crowdsourcing researchers can collect data from populations and demographics they may not have had access to locally but that improve the validity and value of their work   Artists have also used crowdsourcing systems In his project called the Sheep Market Aaron Koblin used Mechanical Turk to collect     drawings of sheep from contributors around the world   Sam Brown artist leverages the crowd by asking visitors of his website explodingdog to send him sentences that he uses as inspirations for paintings   Art curator Andrea Grover argues that individuals tend to be more open in crowdsourced projects because they are not being physically judged or scrutinized   As with other crowdsourcers artists use crowdsourcing systems to generate and collect data The crowd also can be used to provide inspiration and to collect financial support for an artist's work   Additionally crowdsourcing from   million drivers is being used by INRIX to collect users' driving times to provide better GPS routing and real-time traffic updates   Demographics edit The crowd is an umbrella term for the people who contribute to crowdsourcing efforts Though it is sometimes difficult to gather data about the demographics of the crowd a study by Ross et al surveyed the demographics of a sample of the more than     registered crowdworkers using Amazon Mechanical Turk to complete tasks for pay A previous study in   by Ipeirotis found that users at that time were primarily American young female and well-educated with 40% earning more than $40   per year In November   Ross found a very different Mechanical Turk population 36% of which was Indian Two-thirds of Indian workers were male and 66% had at least a bachelor's degree Two-thirds had annual incomes less than $10   with 27% sometimes or always depending on income from Mechanical Turk to make ends meet   The average US user of Mechanical Turk earned $2   per hour for tasks in   versus $1   for the average Indian worker citation needed While the majority of users worked less than five hours per week 18% worked   hours per week or more This is less than minimum wage in the United States but not in India which Ross suggests raises ethical questions for researchers who use crowdsourcing The demographics of Microworkers com differ from Mechanical Turk in that the US and India together account for only 25% of workers   countries are represented among users with Indonesia 18% and Bangladesh 17% contributing the largest share However 28% of employers are from the US   Another study of the demographics of the crowd at iStockphoto found a crowd that was largely white middle- to upper-class higher educated worked in a so-called \"white-collar job\" and had a high-speed Internet connection at home   In a crowd-sourcing diary study of   days in Europe the participants were predominantly higher educated women   Studies have also found that crowds are not simply collections of amateurs or hobbyists Rather crowds are often professionally trained in a discipline relevant to a given crowdsourcing task and sometimes hold advanced degrees and many years of experience in the profession         Claiming that crowds are amateurs rather than professionals is both factually untrue and may lead to marginalization of crowd labor rights   G D Saxton et al   studied the role of community users among other elements during his content analysis of   crowdsourcing organizations Saxton et al developed a taxonomy of nine crowdsourcing models intermediary model citizen media production collaborative software development digital goods sales product design peer-to-peer social financing consumer report model knowledge base building model and collaborative science project model in which to categorize the roles of community users such as researcher engineer programmer journalist graphic designer etc and the products and services developed   Motivations edit Further information Online participation Motivations Contributors edit Many scholars of crowdsourcing suggest that both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations cause people to contribute to crowdsourced tasks and these factors influence different types of contributors                 For example students and people employed full-time rate human capital advancement as less important than part-time workers do while women rate social contact as more important than men do   Intrinsic motivations are broken down into two categories enjoyment-based and community-based motivations Enjoyment-based motivations refer to motivations related to the fun and enjoyment that contributors experience through their participation These motivations include skill variety task identity task autonomy direct feedback from the job and pastime Community-based motivations refer to motivations related to community participation and include community identification and social contact In crowdsourced journalism the motivation factors are intrinsic the crowd is driven by a possibility to make social impact contribute to social change and help their peers   Extrinsic motivations are broken down into three categories immediate payoffs delayed payoffs and social motivations Immediate payoffs through monetary payment are the immediately received compensations given to those who complete tasks Delayed payoffs are benefits that can be used to generate future advantages such as training skills and being noticed by potential employers Social motivations are the rewards of behaving pro-socially   such as the altruistic motivations of online volunteers Chandler and Kapelner found that US users of the Amazon Mechanical Turk were more likely to complete a task when told they were going to help researchers identify tumor cells than when they were not told the purpose of their task However of those who completed the task quality of output did not depend on the framing of the task   Motivation factors in crowdsourcing are often a mix of intrinsic and extrinsic factors   In a crowdsourced law-making project the crowd was motivated by a mix of intrinsic and extrinsic factors Intrinsic motivations included fulfilling civic duty affecting the law for sociotropic reasons to deliberate with and learn from peers Extrinsic motivations included changing the law for financial gain or other benefits Participation in crowdsourced policy-making was an act of grassroots advocacy whether to pursue one s own interest or more altruistic goals such as protecting nature   Another form of social motivation is prestige or status The International Children's Digital Library recruits volunteers to translate and review books Because all translators receive public acknowledgment for their contributions Kaufman and Schulz cite this as a reputation-based strategy to motivate individuals who want to be associated with institutions that have prestige The Mechanical Turk uses reputation as a motivator in a different sense as a form of quality control Crowdworkers who frequently complete tasks in ways judged to be inadequate can be denied access to future tasks providing motivation to produce high-quality work   Requesters edit Using crowdsourcing through means such as Amazon Mechanical Turk can help provide researchers and requesters with an already established infrastructure for their projects allowing them to easily use a crowd and access participants from a diverse culture background Using crowdsourcing can also help complete the work for projects that would normally have geographical and population size limitations   Participation in crowdsourcing edit Despite the potential global reach of IT applications online recent research illustrates that differences in location which? affect participation outcomes in IT-mediated crowds   Limitations and controversies edit At least six major topics cover the limitations and controversies about crowdsourcing Impact of crowdsourcing on product quality Entrepreneurs contribute less capital themselves Increased number of funded ideas The value and impact of the work received from the crowd The ethical implications of low wages paid to crowdworkers Trustworthiness and informed decision making Impact of crowdsourcing on product quality edit Crowdsourcing allows anyone to participate allowing for many unqualified participants and resulting in large quantities of unusable contributions Companies or additional crowdworkers then have to sort through all of these low-quality contributions The task of sorting through crowdworkers contributions along with the necessary job of managing the crowd requires companies to hire actual employees thereby increasing management overhead   For example susceptibility to faulty results is caused by targeted malicious work efforts Since crowdworkers completing microtasks are paid per task often a financial incentive causes workers to complete tasks quickly rather than well Verifying responses is time-consuming so requesters often depend on having multiple workers complete the same task to correct errors However having each task completed multiple times increases time and monetary costs   Crowdsourcing quality is also impacted by task design Lukyanenko et al   argue that the prevailing practice of modeling crowdsourcing data collection tasks in terms of fixed classes options unnecessarily restricts quality Results demonstrate that information accuracy depends on the classes used to model domains with participants providing more accurate information when classifying phenomena at a more general level which is typically less useful to sponsor organizations hence less common Further greater overall accuracy is expected when participants could provide free-form data compared to tasks in which they select from constrained choices Just as limiting oftentimes the scenario is that just not enough skills or expertise exist in the crowd to successfully accomplish the desired task While this scenario does not affect \"simple\" tasks such as image labeling it is particularly problematic for more complex tasks such as engineering design or product validation In these cases it may be difficult or even impossible to find the qualified people in the crowd as their voices may be drowned out by consistent but incorrect crowd members   However if the difficulty of the task is even \"intermediate\" in its difficultly estimating crowdworkers' skills and intentions and leveraging them for inferring true responses works well   albeit with an additional computation cost Crowdworkers are a nonrandom sample of the population Many researchers use crowdsourcing to quickly and cheaply conduct studies with larger sample sizes than would be otherwise achievable However due to limited access to the Internet participation in low developed countries is relatively low Participation in highly developed countries is similarly low largely because the low amount of pay is not a strong motivation for most users in these countries These factors lead to a bias in the population pool towards users in medium developed countries as deemed by the human development index   The likelihood that a crowdsourced project will fail due to lack of monetary motivation or too few participants increases over the course of the project Crowdsourcing markets are not a first-in first-out queue Tasks that are not completed quickly may be forgotten buried by filters and search procedures so that workers do not see them This results in a long-tail power law distribution of completion times   Additionally low-paying research studies online have higher rates of attrition with participants not completing the study once started   Even when tasks are completed crowdsourcing does not always produce quality results When Facebook began its localization program in   it encountered some criticism for the low quality of its crowdsourced translations   One of the problems of crowdsourcing products is the lack of interaction between the crowd and the client Usually little information is known about the final desired product and often very limited interaction with the final client occurs This can decrease the quality of product because client interaction is a vital part of the design process   An additional cause of the decrease in product quality that can result from crowdsourcing is the lack of collaboration tools In a typical workplace coworkers are organized in such a way that they can work together and build upon each other s knowledge and ideas Furthermore the company often provides employees with the necessary information procedures and tools to fulfill their responsibilities However in crowdsourcing crowdworkers are left to depend on their own knowledge and means to complete tasks   A crowdsourced project is usually expected to be unbiased by incorporating a large population of participants with a diverse background However most of the crowdsourcing works are done by people who are paid or directly benefit from the outcome e g most of open source projects working on Linux In many other cases the end product is the outcome of a single person's endeavour who creates the majority of the product while the crowd only participates in minor details   Entrepreneurs contribute less capital themselves edit To make an idea turn into a reality the first component needed is capital Depending on the scope and complexity of the crowdsourced project the amount of necessary capital can range from a few thousand dollars to hundreds of thousands if not more The capital-raising process can take from days to months depending on different variables including the entrepreneur s network and the amount of initial self-generated capital The crowdsourcing process allows entrepreneurs to access to a wide range of investors who can take different stakes in the project   In effect crowdsourcing simplifies the capital-raising process and allows entrepreneurs to spend more time on the project itself and reaching milestones rather than dedicating time to get it started Overall the simplified access to capital can save time to start projects and potentially increase efficiency of projects Opponents of this issue argue easier access to capital through a large number of smaller investors can hurt the project and its creators With a simplified capital-raising process involving more investors with smaller stakes investors are more risk-seeking because they can take on an investment size with which they are comfortable   This leads to entrepreneurs losing possible experience convincing investors who are wary of potential risks in investing because they do not depend on one single investor for the survival of their project Instead of being forced to assess risks and convince large institutional investors why their project can be successful wary investors can be replaced by others who are willing to take on the risk There are translation companies and several users of translations who pretend to use crowdsourcing as a means for drastically cutting costs instead of hiring professional translators This situation has been systematically denounced by IAPTI and other translator organizations   Increased number of funded ideas edit The raw number of ideas that get funded and the quality of the ideas is a large controversy over the issue of crowdsourcing Proponents argue that crowdsourcing is beneficial because it allows niche ideas that would not survive venture capitalist or angel funding many times the primary investors in startups to be started Many ideas are killed in their infancy due to insufficient support and lack of capital but crowdsourcing allows these ideas to be started if an entrepreneur can find a community to take interest in the project   Crowdsourcing allows those who would benefit from the project to fund and become a part of it which is one way for small niche ideas get started   However when the raw number of projects grows the number of possible failures can also increase Crowdsourcing assists niche and high-risk projects to start because of a perceived need from a select few who seek the product With high risk and small target markets the pool of crowdsourced projects faces a greater possible loss of capital lower return and lower levels of success   Concerns edit Because crowdworkers are considered independent contractors rather than employees they are not guaranteed minimum wage In practice workers using the Amazon Mechanical Turk generally earn less than the minimum wage In   it was reported that United States Turk users earned an average of $2   per hour for tasks while users in India earned an average of $1   per hour which is below minimum wage in the United States but not in India     Some researchers who have considered using Mechanical Turk to get participants for research studies have argued that the wage conditions might be unethical     However according to other research workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk do not feel they are exploited and are ready to participate in crowdsourcing activities in the future   When Facebook began its localization program in   it received criticism for using free labor in crowdsourcing the translation of site guidelines   Typically no written contracts nondisclosure agreements or employee agreements are made with crowdworkers For users of the Amazon Mechanical Turk this means that requestors decide whether users' work is acceptable and reserve the right to withhold pay if it does not meet their standards   Critics say that crowdsourcing arrangements exploit individuals in the crowd and a call has been made for crowds to organize for their labor rights       Collaboration between crowd members can also be difficult or even discouraged especially in the context of competitive crowd sourcing Crowdsourcing site InnoCentive allows organizations to solicit solutions to scientific and technological problems only   6% of respondents report working in a team on their submission   Amazon Mechanical Turk workers collaborated with academics to create a platform WeAreDynamo org that allows them to organize and create campaigns to better their work situation   Irresponsible crowdsourcing edit This section does not cite any sources Please help improve

under the spotlight during the first few days after the events of the Boston Marathon bombing as it showed how powerful social media and crowdsourcing could be Reddit was able to help many victims of the bombing as they sent relief and some even opened up their homes all being communicated very efficiently on their site However Reddit soon came under fire after they started to crowdsource information on the possible perpetrators of the bombing While the FBI received thousands of photos from average citizens the website also started to focus on crowdsourcing their own investigation with the information that they were crowdsourcing Eventually Reddit members claimed to have found   bombers but all were innocent including a college student who had committed suicide a few days before the bombing The problem was exacerbated when the media also started to rely on Reddit as their source for information citation needed allowing the misinformation to spread almost nationwide The FBI has since warned the media to be more careful of where they are getting their information but Reddit s investigation and its false accusations opened up questions about what should be crowdsourced and the

telepresence videoconferencing system in   Telepresence refers to a set of technologies which allow a person to feel as if they were present to give the appearance of being present or to have an effect via telerobotics at a place other than their true location Telepresence requires that the users' senses be provided with such stimuli as to give the feeling of being in that other location Additionally users may be given the ability to affect the remote location In this case the user's position movements actions voice etc may be sensed transmitted and duplicated in the remote location to bring about this effect Therefore information may be traveling in both directions between the user and the remote location A popular application is found in telepresence videoconferencing the highest possible level of videotelephony Telepresence via video deploys greater technical sophistication and improved fidelity of both sight and sound than in traditional videoconferencing Technical

Further reading     History edit   History of videotelephony In a pioneering paper the U S cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky attributed the development of the idea of telepresence to science fiction author Robert A Heinlein \"My first vision of a remote-controlled economy came from Robert A Heinlein's prophetic   sic novel Waldo \" wrote Minsky In his science fiction short story \" Waldo \"   Heinlein first proposed a primitive telepresence master-slave manipulator system The Brother Assassin written by Fred Saberhagen in   introduced the complete concept for a telepresence master-slave humanoid system In the novel the concept is described as follows \"And a moment later it seemed to all his senses that he had been transported from the master down into the body of the slave-unit standing beneath it on the floor As the control of its movements passed over to him the slave started gradually to lean to one side and he moved its foot to maintain balance as naturally as he moved his own Tilting back his head he could look up through the slave's eyes to see the master-unit with himself inside maintaining the same attitude on its complex suspension \" Early system for immersive telepresence USAF   - Virtual Fixtures The term telepresence was coined in a   article by Minsky who outlined his vision for an adapted version of the older concept of teleoperation that focused on giving a remote participant a feeling of actually being present at a different location   One of the first systems to create a fully immersive illusion of presence in a remote location was the Virtual Fixtures platform developed in   at the U S Air Force Armstrong Labs by inventor Louis Rosenberg The system included stereoscopic image display from the remote environment as well as immersive touch feedback using a full upper-body exoskeleton       The first commercially successful telepresence company Teleport which was later renamed TeleSuite was founded in   by David Allen and Herold Williams   Before TeleSuite they ran a resort business from which the original concept emerged because they often found businesspeople would have to cut their stays short to participate in important meetings Their idea was to develop a technology that would allow businesspeople to attend their meetings without leaving the resorts so that they could lengthen their hotel stays A Tandberg E20 high resolution videoconferencing phone meant to replace conventional desktop phones Hilton Hotels had originally licensed to install them in their hotels throughout the United States and other countries but use was low The idea lost momentum with Hilton eventually backing out TeleSuite later began to focus less on the hospitality industry and more on business-oriented telepresence systems Shareholders eventually held enough stock to replace the company's original leadership which ultimately led to its collapse citation needed David Allen purchased all of the assets of TeleSuite and appointed Scott Allen as president   of the new company called Destiny Conferencing Destiny Conferencing licensed its patent portfolio to HP which became the first large company to join the telepresence industry soon followed by others such as Cisco and Polycom   After forming a distribution agreement with Pleasanton-based Polycom Destiny Conferencing sold on January     to Polycom for $60 million An important research project in telepresence began in   Located at the University of Toronto the Ontario Telepresence Project OTP was an interdisciplinary effort involving social sciences and engineering Its final report stated that it \" was a three year $4   million pre-competitive research project whose mandate was to design and field trial advanced media space systems in a variety of workplaces in order to gain insights into key sociological and engineering issues The OTP which ended in December   was part of the International Telepresence Project which linked Ontario researchers to their counterparts in four European nations The Project s major sponsor was the Province of Ontario through two of its Centres of Excellence the Information Technology Research Centre ITRC and the Telecommunications Research Institute of Ontario TRIO \"   Benefits edit A modular telepresence system An industry expert described some benefits of telepresence \"There were four drivers for our decision to do more business over video and telepresence We wanted to reduce our travel spend reduce our carbon footprint and environmental impact improve our employees' work/life balance and improve employee productivity \"   American exile Edward Snowden participates in a TED talk in Texas from Russia via telepresence robot March   Rather than traveling great distances in order to have a face-face meeting it is now commonplace to instead use a telepresence system which uses a multiple codec video system which is what the word \"telepresence\" most currently represents Each member/party of the meeting uses a telepresence room to \"dial in\" and can see/talk to every other member on a screen /screens as if they were in the same room This brings enormous time and cost benefits It is also superior to phone conferencing except in cost as the visual aspect greatly enhances communications allowing for perceptions of facial expressions and other body language Mobile collaboration systems combine the use of video audio and on-screen drawing capabilities using newest generation hand-held mobile devices to enable multi-party conferencing in real-time independent of location Benefits include cost-efficiencies resulting from accelerated problem resolution reductions in downtimes and travel improvements in customer service and increased productivity   Implementation edit Telepresence has been described as the human experience of being fully present at a live real-world location remote from one's own physical location Someone experiencing video telepresence would therefore be able to behave and receive stimuli as though part of a meeting at the remote site The aforementioned would result in interactive participation of group activities that would bring benefits to a wide range of users   Implementation of human sensory elements edit To provide a telepresence experience technologies are required that implement the human sensory elements of vision sound and manipulation Vision and sound edit A minimum system usually includes visual feedback Ideally the entire field of view of the user is filled with a view of the remote location and the viewpoint corresponds to the movement and orientation of the user's head In this way it differs from television or cinema where the viewpoint is out of the control of the viewer In order to achieve this the user may be provided with either a very large or wraparound screen or small displays mounted directly in front of the eyes The latter provides a particularly convincing 3D sensation The movements of the user's head must be sensed and the camera must mimic those movements accurately and in real time This is important to prevent unintended motion sickness Another source of future improvement to telepresence displays compared by some to holograms is a projected display technology featuring life-sized imagery   Sound is generally the easiest sensation to implement with high fidelity based on the foundational telephone technology dating back more than   years Very high-fidelity sound equipment has also been available for a considerable period of time with stereophonic sound being more convincing than monaural sound Manipulation edit Monty a telemanipulation prototype from Anybots The ability to manipulate a remote object or environment is an important aspect for some telepresence users and can be implemented in large number of ways depending on the needs of the user Typically the movements of the user's hands position in space and posture of the fingers are sensed by wired gloves inertial sensors or absolute spatial position sensors A robot in the remote location then copies those movements as closely as possible This ability is also known as teleoperation The more closely the robot re-creates the form factor of the human hand the greater the sense of telepresence Complexity of robotic effectors varies greatly from simple one axis grippers to fully anthropomorphic robot hands Haptic teleoperation refers to a system that provides some sort of tactile force feedback to the user so the user feels some approximation of the weight firmness size and/or texture of the remote objects manipulated by the robot Freedom of movement edit iRobot Ava   an autonomous roaming telepresence robot The prevalence of high quality video conferencing using mobile devices tablets and portable computers has enabled a drastic growth in telepresence robots to help give a better sense of remote physical presence for communication and collaboration in the office home or school when one cannot be there in person The robot avatar can move or look around at the command of the remote person Drivable telepresence robots typically contain a display integrated or separate phone or tablet mounted on a roaming base Some examples of roaming telepresence robots include Beam by Suitable Technologies Double by Double Robotics RP-Vita by iRobot Anybots Vgo TeleMe by Mantarobot and Romo by Romotive   More modern roaming telepresence robots may include an ability to operate autonomously The robots can map out the space and be able to avoid obstacles while driving themselves between rooms and their docking stations   Effectiveness edit Telepresence's effectiveness varies by degree of fidelity Research has noted that telepresence solutions differ in degree of implementation from \"immersive\" through \"adaptive\" to \"lite\" solutions   At the top are immersive solutions where the environments at both ends are highly controlled and often the same with respect to lighting acoustics decor and furniture thereby giving all the participants the impression they are together at the same table in the same room thus engendering the \"immersive\" label Adaptive telepresence solutions may use the same technology but the environments at both ends are not highly controlled and hence often differ Adaptive solutions differ from telepresence lite solutions not in terms of control of environments but in terms of integration of technology Adaptive solutions use a managed service whereas telepresence lite solutions use components that someone must integrate Transparency of implementation edit A telepresence conference between participants in Ghana and Newark New Jersey in   A good telepresence strategy puts the human factors first focusing on visual collaboration configurations that closely replicate the brain's innate preferences for interpersonal communications separating from the unnatural \"talking heads\" experience of traditional videoconferencing These cues include life size participants fluid motion accurate flesh tones and the appearance of true eye contact   This is already a well-established technology used by many businesses today The chief executive officer of Cisco Systems John Chambers in June   at the Networkers Conference compared telepresence to teleporting from Star Trek and said that he saw the technology as a potential billion dollar market for Cisco   Rarely will a telepresence system provide such a transparent implementation with such comprehensive and convincing stimuli that the user perceives no differences from actual presence But the user may set aside such differences depending on the application The fairly simple telephone achieves a limited form of telepresence using just the human sensory element of hearing in that users consider themselves to be talking to each other rather than talking to the telephone itself Watching television for example although it stimulates our primary senses of vision and hearing rarely gives the impression that the watcher is no longer at home However television sometimes engages the senses sufficiently to trigger emotional responses from viewers somewhat like those experienced by people who directly witness or experience events Televised depictions of sports events or disasters such as the September   terrorist attacks can elicit strong emotions from viewers As the screen size increases so does the sense of immersion as well as the range of subjective mental experiences available to viewers Some viewers have reported a sensation of genuine vertigo or motion sickness while watching IMAX movies of flying or outdoor sequences Because most currently feasible telepresence gear leaves something to be desired the user must suspend disbelief to some degree and choose to act in a natural way appropriate to the remote location perhaps using some skill to operate the equipment In contrast a telephone user does not see herself as \"operating\" the telephone but merely talking to another person with it Related technologies edit Virtual presence virtual reality edit An Online Video Web Conference in an office Telepresence refers to a user interacting with another live real place and is distinct from virtual presence where the user is given the impression of being in a simulated environment Telepresence and virtual presence rely on similar user-interface equipment and they share the common feature that the relevant portions of the user's experience at some point in the process will be transmitted in an abstract usually digital representation The main functional difference is the entity on the other end a real environment in the case of telepresence vs a computer in the case of immersive virtual reality Applications edit Application examples could be cited within emergency management and security services B&I and the entertainment and education industries   Connecting communities edit Telepresence can be used to establish a sense of shared presence or shared space among geographically separated members of a group citation needed Hazardous environments edit Robonaut   aboard the International Space Station Many other applications in situations where humans are exposed to hazardous situations are readily recognised as suitable candidates for telepresence Mining bomb disposal military operations rescue of victims from fire toxic atmospheres deep sea exploration or even hostage situations are some examples Telepresence also plays a critical role in the exploration of other worlds such as with the Mars Exploration Rovers which are teleoperated from Earth Pipeline inspection edit Small diameter pipes otherwise inaccessible for examination can now be viewed using pipeline video inspection Remote surgery edit The possibility of being able to project the knowledge and the physical skill of a surgeon over long distances has many attractions Thus again there is considerable research underway in the subject Locally controlled robots are currently being used for joint replacement surgery as they are more precise in milling bone to receive the joints The armed forces have an obvious interest since the combination of telepresence teleoperation and telerobotics can potentially save the lives of battle casualties by allowing them prompt attention in mobile operating theatres by remote surgeons Recently teleconferencing has been used in medicine telemedicine or telematics mainly employing audio-visual exchange for the performance of real time remote surgical operations as demonstrated in Regensburg Germany in     In addition to audio-visual data the transfer of haptic tactile information has also been demonstrated in telemedicine   Education edit A professional development expert in Denver uses telepresence to coach a teacher in Utah during the initial research of Project ThereNow Research has been conducted on the use of telepresence to provide professional development to teachers Research has shown that one of the most effective forms of teacher professional development is coaching or cognitive apprenticeship The application of telepresence shows promise for making this approach to teacher professional development practical   The benefits of enabling schoolchildren to take an active part in exploration have also been shown by the JASON and the NASA Ames Research Center programs The ability of a pupil student or researcher to explore an otherwise inaccessible location is a very attractive proposition For example locations where the passage of too many people is harming the immediate environment or the artifacts themselves e g undersea exploration of coral reefs ancient Egyptian tombs and more recent works of art Another application is for remote classroom which allows a professor to interact with students in multiple campuses to teach the same class simultaneously An example of this application is in classrooms of the law schools of Rutgers University Two identical rooms are located in two metropolitan areas Each classroom is equipped with studio lighting audio and video conference equipment connected to a 200-inch monitor on the wall that students face to give an impression that they are all in the same classroom This allows professors to be on either campus and facilitates the interaction among students in both campuses during the classes   Telepresence art edit True telepresence is a multidisciplinary art and science that foundationally integrates engineering psychology and the art of television broadcast In   Diller and Scofidio created the \"Refresh\" an Internet-based art installation that juxtaposed a live web camera with recorded videos staged by professional actors Each image was accompanied with a fictional narrative which made it difficult to distinguish which was the live web camera A soap opera for iMacs In   Eduardo Kac and Ed Bennett created a telepresence installation \"Ornitorrinco on the Moon\" for the international telecommunication arts festival \"Blurred Boundaries\" Entgrenzte Grenzen II It was coordinated by Kulturdata in Graz

social and corporate governance Market governance mechanism v t e Governance is a broader concept than government and also includes the roles played by the community sector and the private sector in managing and planning countries regions and cities   Collaborative Governance involves the government community and private sectors communicating with each other and working together to achieve more than any one sector could achieve on its own Ansell and Gash   have explored the conditions required for effective collaborative governance They say The ultimate goal is to develop a contingency approach of collaboration that can highlight conditions under which collaborative governance will be more or less effective as an approach to policy making and public management   Collaborative governance covers both the informal and formal relationships in problem solving and decision-making Conventional government policy processes can be embedded in wider policy processes by facilitating collaboration between the public private and community sectors   Collaborative Governance requires three things namely support leadership and a forum The support identifies the policy problem to be fixed The leadership gathers the sectors into a forum Then the members of the forum collaborate to develop policies solutions and answers   There are many different forms of collaborative governance as such as Consensus Building and a Collaborative Network Consensus Building \"A process where stakeholders build consensus on actions to address specific public policy problems Community visioning is a process where members of a community build consensus on a descriptions of the community s desired future and on actions to help make goals for the future a reality \"   Collaborative Network This system is meant to accomplish more alignment among community needs strategies of service agencies priority outcomes and resource allocation It s also meant to accomplish building social capital integration of human service delivery and interconnected strategies for relationship building learning processes and measurement and modeling among the participants   Contents   History   Definitions   Advantages of Collaborative Governance   Disadvantages of Collaborative Governance   Social Applications       References     History edit Over the past two decades new collaborative approaches to governing and managing have developed in a range of fields including urban and regional planning public administration and law natural resource management and environmental management Collaborative governance has emerged as a response to the failures of government policy implementation and to the high cost and politicization of regulation and as an alternative to managerialism and adversarial approaches   The field of public administration has changed its focus from bureaucracy to that of collaboration in the context of the network society Public administrators have blurred the lines between the people the private sector and the government Although bureaucracies still remain public administrators have begun to recognize that more can potentially be achieved by collaboration and networking   Collaboration and partnerships are nothing new in the political realm however the wider use of this leadership style has gained momentum in recent years In part this is a response to neoliberalism with its focus on the primacy of the free-market economy and the private sector Definitions edit Ansell and Gash   define collaborative governance as follows   'A governing arrangement where one or more public agencies directly engage non-state stakeholders in a collective decision-making process that is formal consensus-oriented and deliberative and that aims to make or implement public policy or manage public programs or assets' This definition involves six criteria   the forum is initiated by public agencies   participants in the forum include non-state actors   participants engage in decision making and are not merely consulted   the forum is formally organized   the forum aims to make decisions by consensus and   the focus of collaboration is on public policy or public management Emerson Nabatchi and Balogh   have developed a less normative and less restrictive definition as follows   'The processes and structures of public policy decision making and management that engage people constructively across the boundaries of public agencies levels of government and/or the public private and civic spheres in order to carry out a public purpose that could not otherwise be accomplished ' This framework definition is a broader analytic concept and does not limit collaborative governance to state-initiated arrangements and to engagement between government and non-government sectors For example the definition encompasses collaboration between governments at different levels and hybrid partnerships initiated by the private or community sectors Advantages of Collaborative Governance edit The intent of collaborative governance is to improve the overall practice and effectiveness of public administration The advantages of effective collaborative governance are that it enables a better and shared understanding of complex problems involving many stakeholders and allows these stakeholders to work together and agree on solutions It can help policy makers identify and target problems and deliver action more effectively Stakeholders that are involved in developing a solution are more inclined to accept directions given or decisions made It can thus serve as a way to identify policy solutions that have greater traction in the community Additionally it can contribute new perspectives on issues and policy solutions and thus offer new ways to implement strategies for change For public officials who work in administration and management collaborative governance can serve as a way of genuinely allowing a wider array of ideas and suggestions in the policy process It may also be used to test ideas and analyze responses before implementation For those who are not involved in formal government it allows them to better understand the inner workings of government and carry more influence in the decision making process For both public and private sectors a commitment to collaboration is likely to drive organizational change and affect resource reallocation Other advantages include combining relevant skills and capacities as well as allowing specialization Overall collaborative governance can lead to mutual learning and shared experiences while also providing direction for institutional capacity building inside and outside agencies and organizations   Disadvantages of Collaborative Governance edit The disadvantages of collaborative governance in relation to complex problems are that the process is time consuming it may not reach agreement on solutions and the relevant government agencies may not implement the agreed solutions In a complex structure with many entities working together individual roles can become unclear and confusing Some individuals act largely in a personal capacity while others may act on behalf of agencies or organizations Powerful stakeholder groups may seek to manipulate the process Structural issues also affect agendas and outcomes Open structures with loose leadership and membership allow multiple participants to gain access to a fast expanding agenda Achieving goals in such a wide agenda becomes more difficult as an increasing number of players struggle to resolve differences and coordinate actions Furthermore challenges arise for implementation when representatives are allowed to come and go with no real obligations to other collaborators Accountability of participating members unequal or hidden agendas trust between members power imbalances and language and cultural barriers are all issues that can arise in collaborative government regimes Critics argue that collaborative governance does not provide the institutional stability and consistency required and therefore deters progress   The work of Ansell and Gash   and Emerson Nabatchi and Balogh   seeks to understand these issues and challenges and identify the social and process conditions required for effective collaborative governance Social Applications edit Collaborative governance has been used to address many complex social environmental and urban planning issues including flood crisis management and urban growth management in Australia community visioning and planning in New Zealand and public participation in the redesign of the Ground Zero site in New York   In the UK the USA and countries across much of Western Europe governments have attempted to shift the focus towards various forms of co-production with other agencies and sectors and with citizens themselves in order to increase civic participation   The classic forms of hierarchical governance and representative democracy are seen as inefficient when it comes to engaging citizens and making them a part of the decision making process Large projects and initiatives require involvement and communication with not only citizens but partnerships with other government and non-government agencies and in some instances international cooperation with foreign governments and organizations For example managing the growing number of official and non-official crossings of the US-Mexico border has required input from all levels of US and Mexican governments multiple government agencies like U S Forest Services and U S Border Patrol land management and other non-federal agencies for social affairs All of these parties had to communicate and collaborate to address issues of border security and protecting natural resources As a result the U S Border Patrol and Forest Service successfully enacted the terms of the   memorandum of understanding creating inter-agency forums increasing field coordination and joint operations and constructing fences and other tactical infrastructure   Governing and managing large and growing metropolitan urban areas covering numerous local governments and various levels of State and National governments provides many governance challenges and opportunities   Abbott has reviewed metropolitan planning in South East Queensland SEQ Australia where collaborative governance arrangements between State and local governments and the regional community have evolved over a 20-year period leading to positive outputs and outcomes   The positive outputs and outcomes of collaborative governance and metropolitan planning in SEQ have been extensive and broad and extend well beyond statutory regional land use planning These include three endorsed non-statutory regional plans two endorsed statutory regional plans an infrastructure program linked to the State budget regional sectoral plans for transport water supply natural resource management

thinking as a particular approach to creatively solving problems lie in the development of creativity techniques in the 1950s and the development of new design methods in the 1960s L Bruce Archer was perhaps the first author to use the term 'design thinking' in his book \"Systematic Method for Designers\"     The notion of design as a \"way of thinking\" in the sciences can be traced to Herbert A Simon 's   book The Sciences of the Artificial   and in design engineering to Robert McKim's   book Experiences in Visual Thinking   Bryan Lawson's   book How Designers Think primarily addressing design in architecture began a process of generalising the concept of design thinking   A   article by Nigel Cross established some of the intrinsic qualities and abilities of design thinking that made it relevant in general education and thus for wider audiences   Peter Rowe's   book Design Thinking which described methods and approaches used by architects and urban planners was a significant early usage of the term in the design research literature   Rolf Faste expanded on McKim's work at Stanford University in the 1980s and 1990s     teaching \"design thinking as a method of creative action \"   Design thinking was adapted for business purposes by Faste's Stanford colleague David M Kelley who founded the design consultancy IDEO in     Richard Buchanan 's   article \"Wicked Problems in Design Thinking\" expressed a broader view of design thinking as addressing intractable human concerns through design   Play media Design thinking example video Solution-focused thinking edit Design thinking is a method for practical creative resolution of problems It is a form of solution-focused thinking with the intent of producing a constructive future result Design thinking identifies and investigates both known and ambiguous aspects of the current situation in an effort to discover parameters and alternative solution sets which may lead to one or more satisfactory goals Because design thinking is iterative intermediate \"solutions\" are potential starting points of alternative paths allowing for redefinition of the initial problem in a process of co-evolution of problem and solution   Solution-based vs problem-based edit In   Bryan Lawson published results from an empirical study to investigate the different problem-solving approaches of designers and scientists He took two groups of students final year students in architecture and post-graduate science students and asked them to create one-layer structures from a set of coloured blocks The perimeter of the structure had to optimize either the red or the blue colour however there were unspecified rules governing the placement and relationship of some of the blocks Lawson found that The scientists adopted a technique of trying out a series of designs which used as many different blocks and combinations of blocks as possible as quickly as possible Thus they tried to maximise the information available to them about the allowed combinations If they could discover the rule governing which combinations of blocks were allowed they could then search for an arrangement which would optimise the required colour around the layout problem-focused By contrast the architects selected their blocks in order to achieve the appropriately coloured perimeter If this proved not to be an acceptable combination then the next most favourably coloured block combination would be substituted and so on until an acceptable solution was discovered solution-focused Bryan Lawson How Designers Think   Nigel Cross concluded that Lawson's studies suggested that scientists problem solve by analysis while designers problem solve by synthesis   Analysis and synthesis edit The terms analysis and synthesis come from classical Greek and mean literally \"to loosen up\" and \"to put together\" respectively In general analysis is defined as the procedure by which we break down an intellectual or substantial whole into parts or components Synthesis is defined as the opposite procedure to combine separate elements or components in order to form a coherent whole However analysis and synthesis as scientific methods always go hand in hand they complement one another Every synthesis is built upon the results of a preceding analysis and every analysis requires a subsequent synthesis in order to verify and correct its results   Divergent thinking versus convergent thinking edit Design thinking employs divergent thinking as a way to ensure that many possible solutions are explored and then convergent thinking as a way to narrow these down to a final preferred solution Divergent thinking is the ability to offer different unique or variant ideas adherent to one theme while convergent thinking is the ability to find the preferred solution to the given problem Design thinking as a process for problem-solving edit Unlike analytical thinking design thinking includes \"building up\" ideas with few or no limits on breadth during a \"brainstorming\" phase   This helps reduce fear of failure in the participant s and encourages input and participation from a wide variety of sources in the ideation phases The phrase \" thinking outside the box \" has been coined to describe one goal of the brainstorming phase and is encouraged since this can aid in the discovery of hidden elements and ambiguities in the situation and discovering potentially faulty assumptions One version of the design thinking process has seven stages define research ideate prototype choose implement and learn   Within these seven steps problems can be framed the right questions can be asked more ideas can be created and the best answers can be chosen The steps aren't linear can occur simultaneously and be repeated A simpler expression of the process is Robert McKim's phrase \"Express Test Cycle\"   An alternative five-phase description of the process is described by Christoph Meinel and Larry Leifer re defining the problem needfinding and benchmarking ideating building testing   Yet another way to look at it is Shewhart 's \"Plan-Do-Study-Act\" PDSA cycle Although design is always influenced by individual preferences the design thinking method shares a common set of traits mainly creativity ambidextrous thinking teamwork user-centeredness empathy curiosity and optimism   These traits are exemplified by design thinking methods in \" serious play \" The path through these process steps is not strictly circular Meinel and Leifer state \"While the stages are simple enough the adaptive expertise required to choose the right inflection points and appropriate next stage is a high order intellectual activity that requires practice and is learnable \"   Design thinking is also closely aligned to co-design a form of design thinking where stakeholders associated with the product or service are directly involved in the design process at each stage This process has been shown to produce more innovative solutions than more traditional perspectives of non-group based stakeholder consultation   Wicked problems edit Design thinking is especially useful when addressing what Horst Rittel referred to as wicked problems which are ill-defined or tricky as opposed to wicked in the sense of malicious   With ill-defined problems both the problem and the solution are unknown at the outset of the problem-solving exercise This is as opposed to \"tame\" or \"well-defined\" problems where the problem is clear and the solution is available through some technical knowledge   For wicked problems the general thrust of the problem may be clear however considerable time and effort is spent in order to clarify the requirements A large part of the problem solving activity then consists of problem definition and problem shaping   Design thinking for social innovation edit Social challenges require systemic solutions that are grounded in the client's or customer's needs Nonprofits are beginning to use design thinking as well to develop better solutions to social problems because it crosses the traditional boundaries between public for-profit and nonprofit sectors By working closely with the clients and consumers design thinking allows high-impact solutions to bubble up from below rather than being imposed from the top   Attributes of design thinking edit Principles edit Christoph Meinel and Larry Leifer of the HPI-Stanford Design Thinking Program four principles for the successful implementation of design thinking   The human rule which states that all design activity is ultimately social in nature and any social innovation will bring us back to the 'human-centric point of view' The ambiguity rule in which design thinkers must preserve ambiguity by experimenting at the limits of their knowledge and ability enabling the freedom to see things differently The re-design rule where all design is re-design this comes as a result of changing technology and social circumstances but previously solved unchanged human needs The tangibility rule the concept that making ideas tangible always facilitates communication and allows designers to treat prototypes as 'communication media' The \"a-ha moment\" edit The \"a-ha moment\" is the moment where there is suddenly a clear forward path   It is the point in the cycle where synthesis and divergent thinking analysis and convergent thinking and the nature of the problem all come together and an appropriate resolution has been captured Prior to this point the process may seem nebulous hazy and inexact At this point the path forward is so obvious that in retrospect it seems odd that it took so long to recognize it After this point the focus becomes more and more clear as the final product or service is constructed   Methods and process edit Design methods and design process are often used interchangeably but there are significant differences between the two Design methods are techniques rules or ways of doing things that someone uses within a design discipline Methods for design thinking include interviewing creating user profiles looking at other existing solutions creating prototypes mind mapping asking questions like the five whys drawing issue trees or issue maps   and situational analysis Because of design thinking's parallel nature there are many different paths through the phases This is part of the reason design thinking may seem to be \"fuzzy\" or \"ambiguous\" when compared to more analytical Cartesian methods of science and engineering Some early design processes stemmed from soft systems methodology Koberg and Bagnall wrote The Universal Traveler in   which presented a circular seven-step soft systems approach to problem-solving 'in daily life'   These seven steps could be followed also linearly or in feed-back loops and many other expressions and models of design processes have been proposed Hugh Dubberly's free e-book How Do You Design A Compendium of Models summarizes a large number of design process models   The use of visual analogy in design thinking and learning edit Ill-defined problems often contain higher-order and obscure relationships Design thinking can address these through the use of analogies An understanding of the expected results or lack of domain-related knowledge for the task may be developed by correlating different internal representations such as images to develop an understanding of the obscure or ill-defined elements of the situation The process involves several complex cognitive mechanisms as the design task often has elements in multiple cognitive domains visual mathematical auditory or tactile requiring the usage of multiple \"languages\" like visual thinking The languages of design edit Conventionally designers communicate mostly in visual or object languages   Symbols signs and metaphors are used through the medium of sketching diagrams and technical drawings to translate abstract requirements into concrete objects The way designers communicate then is through understanding this way of coding design requirements in order to produce built products   The process of design thinking edit As an approach design thinking taps into innate human capacities that are overlooked by more conventional problem-solving practices   The process is best thought of as a system of overlapping spaces rather than a sequence of orderly steps inspiration ideation and implementation   or alternatively empathize define ideate prototype and test   Projects may loop back through inspiration ideation and implementation more than once as the team refines its ideas and explores new directions Therefore design thinking can feel chaotic but over the life of a project participants come to see that the process makes sense and achieves results even though its form differs from the linear milestone-based processes that organizations typically undertake   Inspiration edit Generally the design process starts with the inspiration phase understanding the problem or the opportunity This understanding can be documented in a brief which includes constraints that gives the project team a framework from which to begin benchmarks by which they can measure progress and a set of objectives to be realized such as price point available technology and market segment   Empathy edit Designers approach users with empathy understanding what humans need or might need what makes life easier and more enjoyable what technologically is useful and more usable It is not only about making things more ergonomic but about understanding people - the way they do things and why their physical and emotional needs how they think about the world and what is meaningful to them   Conventional research methods like focus groups and survey can be useful in pointing towards incremental improvements but those don't usually lead to breakthroughs because these techniques simply ask people what they want Henry Ford understood this when he said \"If I'd asked my customers what they wanted they'd have said 'a faster horse \" and no one would have said a car   Ideation Divergent and convergent thinking edit Ideation is idea generation Mentally it represents a process of \"going wide\" in terms of concepts and outcomes   The process is characterized by the alternation of divergent and convergent thinking typical of design thinking process To achieve divergent thinking it is important to have a diverse group of people involved in the process Multidisciplinary people architects who have studied psychology artists with MBAs or engineers with marketing experience often demonstrate this quality They're people with the capacity and the disposition for collaboration across disciplines   Interdisciplinary teams typically move into a structured brainstorming process by \"thinking outside the box\" During this process participants ideas should not be judged and participants should take generative role   Participants are encouraged to come up with as many ideas as possible and to explore new alternatives Good ideas naturally rise to the top whereas the bad ones drop off early on Every member of the team needs to possess a depth of skill that allows him or her to make tangible contributions to the outcome and to be empathic for people and for disciplines beyond their own It tends to be expressed as openness curiosity optimism a tendency toward learning through doing and experimentation   Convergent thinking on the other hand allows for zooming and focusing on the different proposals to select the best choice which permits continuation of the design thinking process to achieve the final goals After collecting lots of ideas a team goes through a process of synthesis in which it has to translate ideas into insights that can lead to solutions or opportunities for change This approach helps multiply options to create choices and different insights about human behavior and define in which direction the process should go on These might be either visions of new product offerings or choices among various ways of creating interactive experience   Complexity and mindset conditions edit More choices mean more complexity which can affect organization's decisions to restrict choices in favour of the obvious and the incremental Although this tendency may be more efficient in the short run it tends to make an organization conservative and inflexible in the long run   Divergent thinking is the route not the obstacle to innovation and a way to diverge is to define a mindset of condition in which people are encouraged to produce lots of ideas The most notable themes fall into three general traits open-minded collaboration courage and conviction   Open minded refers to the concept of being opened and accept new ideas and contributions Courage is also fundamental because innovative ideas are characterized by a high risk of failure It permits to face failure element of high importance in order to improve in the right way In addition conviction is the mindset which permits to carry on a process or an idea even if there are constraints or obstacles Implementation and prototyping edit The third space of the design thinking process is implementation when the best ideas generated during ideation are turned into something concrete   At the core of the implementation process is prototyping turning ideas into actual products and services that are then tested iterated and refined A prototype helps to gather feedback and improve the idea Prototypes speed up the process of innovation because they allow one to understand strengths and weaknesses of new solutions Prototyping is particularly important for products and services destined for the developing world where the lack of infrastructure retail chains communication networks literacy and other essential pieces of the system often make it difficult to design new products and services   Prototyping testing \"failing many times but quickly and cheaply in order to succeed\"   are different existing methods to test solutions but the earlier users can give feedbacks the lower are the costs for the organizations and higher is the level of adaptation of the solution to customer needs Differences from science and humanities edit Although many design fields have been categorized as lying between science and the arts and humanities design may be seen as its own distinct way of understanding the world based on solution-based problem solving problem shaping synthesis and appropriateness in the built environment One of the first design science theorists John Chris Jones postulated that design was different than the arts sciences and mathematics in the 1970s In response to the question \"Is designing an art a science or a form of mathematics?\" Jones responded The main point of difference is that of timing Both artists and scientists operate on the physical world as it exists in the present whether it is real or symbolic while mathematicians operate on abstract relationships that are independent of historical time Designers on the other hand are forever bound to treat as real that which exists only in an imagined future and have to specify ways in which the foreseen thing can be made to exist John Chris Jones Design Method   Nigel Cross built upon the early work of Bruce Archer to show the differences between the humanities the sciences and design in his paper \"Designerly Ways of Knowing\"   He observed that in the sciences the phenomenon of study centres around the natural world the appropriate methods being controlled experiment classification and analysis In this culture objectivity rationality neutrality and a concern for \"truth\" are most valued In the humanities analogy metaphor and evaluation serve as methods of study of the human experience The values of this culture include subjectivity imagination commitment and a concern for \"justice\" Design however concerns itself with the artificial world and uses modeling pattern-forming and synthesis to study it In design practicality ingenuity empathy and a concern for \"appropriateness\" are the core values Design thinking in business edit Design thinking has two common interpretations in the business world citation needed Designers bringing their methods into business by either taking part themselves in business process or training business people to use design methods Designers achieving innovative outputs or products for example the iPod The first interpretation has been described by Tim Brown CEO of IDEO at a TED lecture   though his blog   also considers the second interpretation The limits of the first kind of design thinking in business are also being explored Not all problems yield to design thinking alone where it may be a \"temporary fix\"   Design thinking companies including IDEO and Sense Worldwide are responding to this by building business thinking capabilities   Tim Brown has argued that design thinking is now widely but sporadically used in business He argues that competitive advantage comes from sustained use of design thinking from becoming \"masters of the art \"   In organization and management theory design thinking forms part of the Architecture/Design/Anthropology A/D/A paradigm which characterizes innovative human-centered enterprises This paradigm also focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an abductive mode of thinking compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics/Economics/Psychology M/E/P management paradigm   A study by the London Business School found that for every percent of sales invested in product design profits rose by an average of   to   percent   Historically designers were only introduced in the last steps of product development process focusing their attention on improving the look and functionality of products instead looking for a high impact on the world and the society Design was a tool of consumerism able to make products more attractive easier to use and more marketable   In recent years designers developed specific methods and tools to deliver products and services and businesses are beginning to realize the necessity of design as a competitive asset Therefore designers bring their methods into business by either taking part themselves in the earliest stages of business processes or training business people to use design methods and to build business thinking capabilities Design thinking as the perfect balance between desirability technical feasibility and economic viability helps organizations to be more innovative better differentiate their brands and bring their products and services to market faster   Design thinking in education edit All forms of professional design education can be assumed to be developing design thinking in students even if only implicitly but design thinking is also now explicitly taught in general as well as professional education across all sectors of education Design as a subject was introduced into secondary schools' educational curricula in the UK in the 1970s gradually replacing and/or developing from some of the traditional art and craft subjects and increasingly linked with technology studies This development sparked related research studies in both education and design       In the K-12 sector design thinking is used to promote creative thinking teamwork and student responsibility for learning New courses in design thinking have also been introduced at university level especially where linked with business and innovation studies A notable early course of this type was introduced at Stanford University in   the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design known as the d school It draws students from several Stanford departments including engineering medicine business law and education utilizing the d school approach to design thinking to develop innovative solutions to problems Also the REDLab group from Stanford's Graduate School of Education conducts research into design thinking in K-12 secondary and post-secondary settings   History time line edit pre-1960 The origins of design thinking probably lie in the development of creativity techniques in the 1950s Harold van Doren published Industrial Design A Practical Guide to Product Design and Development which includes discussions of design methods and practices in   early 1960s The first notable books on methods of creativity are published by William J J Gordon     and Alex Faickney Osborn     The   Conference on Systematic and Intuitive Methods in Engineering Industrial Design Architecture and Communications London UK started interest studying design processes and developing new design methods   Books on methods and theories of design in different fields are published by Morris Asimow   engineering   Christopher Alexander   architecture   L Bruce Archer   industrial design   and John Chris Jones   product and systems design     L Bruce Archer argues that design is \"not merely a craft-based skill but should be considered a knowledge-based discipline in its own right with rigorous methodology and research principles incorporated into the design process\" He is also perhaps the first author to use the term 'design thinking' in a limited sense in his book \"Systematic Method for Designers\" in the comment \"Ways have had to be found to incorporate knowledge of ergonomics cybernetics marketing and management science into design thinking\"     Archer develops the relationship of design thinking with management \"The time is rapidly approaching when design decision making and management decision making techniques will have so much in common that the one will become no more than the extension of the other\"     Herbert A Simon notable for his research in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences proposes a \"science of design\" that would be \"a body of intellectually tough analytic partly formalizable partly empirical teachable doctrine about the design process \"     Don Koberg and Jim Bagnall pioneer a 'soft systems' design process for dealing with the problems of 'everyday life' in their book The Universal Traveler     Robert McKim publishes Experiences in Visual Thinking   which includes \"Express Test Cycle\" ETC as an iterative backbone for design processes Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber publish \"Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning\" showing that design and planning problems are wicked problems as opposed to \"tame\" single disciplinary problems of science   L Bruce Archer extends inquiry into designerly ways of knowing claiming \"There exists a designerly way of thinking and communicating that is both different from scientific and scholarly ways of thinking and communicating and as powerful as scientific and scholarly methods of inquiry when applied to its own kinds of problems \"   \"Design Studies\" the first research journal focussing on design processes begins publishing 1980s Systematic engineering design methods are developed particularly in Germany and Japan The International Conferences on Engineering Design ICED is formed Several books on engineering design methods are published by Hubka     Pahl and Beitz     French     Cross     and Pugh     In the USA the National Science Foundation initiative on design theory and methods led to substantial growth in engineering design methods in the late-1980s The American Society of Mechanical Engineers ASME launched its series of conferences on design theory and methodology The 1980s also sees the rise of human-centered design and the rise of design-centered business management   Bryan Lawson publishes How Designers Think about design cognition in the context of architecture and urban planning     Nigel Cross publishes \"Designerly Ways of Knowing\" drawing on design research to develop Archer's concept that \"There are things to know ways of knowing them and ways of finding out about them\" that are specific to design and showing designerly knowing and thinking to have sufficient intrinsic worth to be included as part of general education     Donald Sch n publishes The Reflective Practitioner in which he sought to establish \"an epistemology of practice implicit in the artistic intuitive processes that design and other practitioners bring to situations of uncertainty instability uniqueness and value conflict \"     The business management strategy Six Sigma emerges as a way to streamline the design process for quality control and profit   Peter Rowe publishes Design Thinking focused on architecture and planning     Rolf Faste publishes \"Ambidextrous Thinking\" extending McKim's process of visual thinking to design as a \"whole-body way of doing \"     The first symposium on Research in Design Thinking is held at Delft University The Netherlands   IDEO design consultancy formed by combining three industrial design companies They are one of the first design companies to showcase their design process which draws heavily on the Stanford University curriculum   Richard Buchanan's article \"Wicked Problems in Design Thinking\" is published   Eugene S Ferguson's book Engineering and the Mind's Eye is published   Pierre Sachse and Adrian Specker publish the book \"Design Thinking\" at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology - ETH Zurich   21st Century The start of the 21st century brought a significant increase in interest in design thinking as the term becomes popularized in the business press Books about how to create a more design-focused workplace where innovation can thrive are written for the business sector by Richard Florida     Daniel Pink     Roger Martin     Malcolm Gladwell     Tim Brown     Thomas Lockwood     Vijay Kumar     Larry Keeley     and Kim Erwin     This shift of design thinking away from the creation of products into the business sector sparked a debate about the hijacking and exploitation of design thinking   The UK based design consultancy firm

achieve their goals One of the earliest definitions of collaborative software is \"intentional group processes plus software to support them\"   In terms of the level of interaction it allows collaborative software may be divided into real-time collaborative editing RTCE platforms that allow multiple users to engage in live simultaneous and reversible editing of a single file usually a document and version control also known as revision control and source control platforms which allow separate users to make parallel edits to a file while preserving every saved edit by every user as multiple files that are variants of the original file Collaborative software is a broad concept that overlaps considerably with computer-supported cooperative work CSCW According to Carstensen and Schmidt     groupware is part of CSCW The authors claim that CSCW and thereby groupware addresses \"how collaborative activities and their coordination can be supported by means of computer systems \" Software products such as email calendaring text chat wiki and bookmarking belong to this category whenever used for group work citation needed whereas the more general term social software applies to systems used outside the workplace for example online dating services and social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook The use of collaborative software in the work space creates a collaborative working environment CWE Finally collaborative software relates to the notion of collaborative work systems which are conceived as any form of human organization that emerges any time that collaboration takes place whether it is formal or informal intentional or unintentional   Whereas the groupware or collaborative software pertains to the technological elements of computer-supported

Origins edit   MUD Douglas Engelbart first envisioned collaborative computing in   and documented his vision in     with working prototypes in full operational use by his research team by the mid-1960s   and held the first public demonstration of his work in   in what is now referred to as \" The Mother of All Demos \"   The following year Engelbart's lab was hooked into the ARPANET the first computer network enabling them to extend services to a broader userbase See also Intelligence Amplification Section   Douglas Engelbart ARPANET Section on ARPANET Deployed and the Doug Engelbart Archive Collection Online collaborative gaming software began between early networked computer users In   Will Crowther created Colossal Cave Adventure on a DEC PDP-10 computer As internet connections grew so did the numbers of users and multi-user games In   Roy Trubshaw a student at University of Essex in the United Kingdom created the game MUD Multi-User Dungeon The US Government began using truly collaborative applications in the early 1990s   One of the first robust applications was the Navy's Common Operational Modeling Planning and Simulation Strategy COMPASS   The COMPASS system allowed up to   users to create point-to-point connections with one another the collaborative session only remained while at least one user stayed active and would have to be recreated if all six logged out MITRE improved on that model by hosting the collaborative session on a server that each user logged into Called the Collaborative Virtual Workstation CVW this allowed the session to be set up in a virtual file cabinet and virtual rooms and left as a persistent session that could be joined later   In   Pavel Curtis who had built MUDs at PARC created PlaceWare a server that simulated a one-to-many auditorium with side chat between \"seat-mates\" and the ability to invite a limited number of audience members to speak In   engineers at GTE used the PlaceWare engine in a commercial version of MITRE's CVW calling it InfoWorkSpace IWS In   IWS was chosen as the military standard for the standardized Air Operations Center   The IWS product was sold to General Dynamics and then later to Ezenia   Groupware edit Collaborative software was originally designated as groupware and this term can be traced as far back as the late 1980s when Richman and Slovak     wrote \"Like an electronic sinew that binds teams together the new groupware aims to place the computer squarely in the middle of communications among managers technicians and anyone else who interacts in groups revolutionizing the way they work \" Even further back in   Peter and Trudy Johnson-Lenz coined the term groupware their initial   definition of groupware was intentional group processes plus software to support them Later in their article they went on to explain groupware as computer-mediated culture an embodiment of social organization in hyperspace \" Groupware integrates co-evolving human and tool systems yet is simply a single system   In the early 1990s the first commercial groupware products were delivered and big companies such as Boeing and IBM started using electronic meeting systems for key internal projects Lotus Notes appeared as a major example of that product category allowing remote group collaboration when the internet was still in its infancy Kirkpatrick and Losee     wrote then \"If GROUPWARE really makes a difference in productivity long term the very definition of an office may change You will be able to work efficiently as a member of a group wherever you have your computer As computers become smaller and more powerful that will mean anywhere \" Design and implementation issues edit The complexity of groupware development is still an issue One reason for this is the socio-technical dimension of groupware Groupware designers do not only have to address technical issues as in traditional software development but also consider the organizational aspects   and the social group processes that should be supported with the groupware application Some examples for issues in groupware development are Persistence is needed in some sessions Chat and voice communications are routinely non-persistent and evaporate at the end of the session Virtual room and online file cabinets can persist for years The designer of the collaborative space needs to consider the information duration needs and implement accordingly Authentication has always been a problem with groupware When connections are made point-to-point or when log-in registration is enforced it's clear who is engaged in the session However audio and unmoderated sessions carry the risk of unannounced 'lurkers' who observe but do not announce themselves or contribute     Until recently bandwidth issues at fixed location limited full use of the tools These are exacerbated with mobile devices Multiple input and output streams bring concurrency issues into the groupware applications Motivational issues are important especially in settings where no pre-defined group process was in place Closely related to the motivation aspect is the question of reciprocity Ellis and others   have shown that the distribution of efforts and benefits has to be carefully balanced in order to ensure that all required group members really participate One approach for addressing these issues is the use of design patterns for groupware design   The patterns identify recurring groupware design issues and discuss design choices in a way that all stakeholders can participate in the groupware development process Groupware and levels of collaboration edit Groupware can be divided into three categories depending on the level of collaboration     Communication can be thought of as unstructured interchange of information A phone call or an IM Chat discussion are examples of this Conferencing or collaboration level as it is called in the academic papers that discuss these levels refers to interactive work toward a shared goal Brainstorming or voting are examples of this Co-ordination refers to complex interdependent work toward a shared goal A good metaphor for understanding this is to think about a sports team everyone has to contribute the right play at the right time as well as adjust their play to the unfolding situation - but everyone is doing something different - in order for the team to win That is complex interdependent work toward a shared goal collaborative management Collaborative management coordination tools edit Collaborative management tools facilitate and manage group activities Examples include Electronic calendars also called time management software schedule events and automatically notify and remind group members Project management systems schedule track and chart the steps in a project as it is being completed Online proofing share review approve and reject web proofs artwork photos or videos between designers customers and clients Workflow systems collaborative management of tasks and documents within a knowledge-based business process Knowledge management systems collect organize manage and share various forms of information Enterprise bookmarking collaborative bookmarking engine to tag organize share and search enterprise data Prediction markets let a group of people predict together the outcome of future

systems quickly share company information to members within a company via Internet e g marketing and product info   Social software systems organize social relations of groups Online spreadsheets collaborate and share structured data and information Client portals interact and share with your clients in a private online environment citation needed Collaborative software and human interaction edit The design intent of collaborative software groupware is to transform the way documents and rich media are shared in order to enable more effective team collaboration Collaboration with respect to information technology seems to have several definitions Some are defensible but others are so broad they lose any meaningful application Understanding the differences in human interactions is necessary to ensure the appropriate technologies are employed to meet interaction needs There are three primary ways in which humans interact conversations transactions and collaborations Conversational interaction is an exchange of information between two or more participants where the primary purpose of the interaction is discovery or relationship building There is no central entity around which the interaction revolves but is a free exchange of information with no defined constraints generally focused on personal experiences   Communication technology such as telephones instant messaging and e-mail are generally sufficient for conversational interactions Transactional interaction involves the exchange of transaction entities where a major function of the transaction entity is to alter the relationship between participants In collaborative interactions the main function of the participants' relationship is to alter a collaboration entity i e the converse of transactional

Tugendhelden circa 1612-1614 by Peter Paul Rubens Monument of Peter the Great in Saint Petersburg Greatness is a concept of a state of superiority affecting a person or object in a particular place or area Greatness can also be referred to individuals who possess a natural ability to be better than all others The concept carries the implication that the particular person or object when compared to others of a similar type has clear advantage over others As a descriptive term it is most often applied to a person or their work and may be qualified or unqualified An example of an expression of the concept in a qualified sense would be \" Oh My Girl is the definition of greatness\" or \" Stalin was one of the greatest wartime leaders\" In the unqualified sense it might be stated \"Stalin achieved greatness within his own lifetime\" thus implying that \"greatness\" is a definite and identifiable quality Application of the terms \"great\" and \"greatness\" is dependent on the perspective and subjective judgements of those who apply them   Whereas in some cases the perceived \"greatness\" of a person place or object might be agreed upon by many this is not necessarily the case and the perception of \"greatness\" may be both fiercely contested and highly individual   Historically in Europe rulers were sometimes given the attribute \"the Great\" as in Alexander the Great Frederick the Great and Catherine the Great Starting with the Roman consul and general Pompey the Latin equivalent \" Magnus \" was also used as in Pompeius Magnus Albertus Magnus and Carolus Magnus The English language uses the Latin term magnum opus literally \"Great work\" to describe certain works of art and literature Since the publication of Francis Galton s Hereditary Genius in   and especially with the accelerated development of intelligence tests in the early 1900s there has been a vast amount of social scientific research published relative to the question of greatness Much of this research does not actually use the term great in describing itself preferring terms such as eminence genius exceptional achievement etc   Historically the major intellectual battles over this topic have focused around the questions of nature and nurture or person vs context   Today the importance of both dimensions is accepted by all but disagreements over the relative importance of each are still reflected in variations in research emphases   Contents   Genetic approaches     Hereditary Genius Galton       Early Mental Traits of   Geniuses Cox     Cultural approach     Configurations of Cultural Growth Kroeber     Developmental approaches     Scientific Elite Zuckerman       Developing Talent in Young People Bloom et al     Recent approaches     The Arrival of The Fittest - Dorris         Notes   References   Further reading     Genetic approaches edit The early research had a strong genetic emphasis and focused on intelligence as the driving force behind greatness Hereditary Genius Galton   edit The earliest such research Hereditary Genius by Francis Galton   argued that people vary hugely in natural ability which is inherited biologically Those at the very top end of the range i e geniuses become the leaders and great achievers of their generation To prove this thesis Galton collected data showing that genius clusters in what he termed Notable Family Lines such as those of Bernoulli Cassini Darwin Herschel and Jussieu in science or Bach in music   Galton then calculated the odds of eminent people having eminent relations taking into account the closeness of the biological connection e g son vs grandson and the magnitude of achievement of the eminent parent His findings were as anticipated the more famous the parent i e the greater level of presumed natural ability the greater likelihood there would be illustrious relatives and the closer the blood tie the greater those odds   Early Mental Traits of   Geniuses Cox   edit Catharine Cox s book on The Early Mental Traits of Three Hundred Geniuses   was similar to Galton s in its orientation Using the method that her mentor Stanford Psychology Professor Lewis Terman had developed for differentiating children in terms of intelligence Cox coded records of childhood and adolescent achievements of   historic eminent leaders and creators to estimate what their IQs would have been on the basis of intellectual level of such achievements relative to the age at which they were accomplished For example John Stuart Mill reportedly studied Greek at   read Plato at   and learned calculus at   As such what he was doing at   the average person couldn t do until   years   months of age giving Mill an estimated IQ of     Cox found that the perceived eminence of those with the highest IQs was higher than that of those attaining lower IQ estimates and that those with higher IQs also exhibited more versatility in their achievements For example da Vinci Michelangelo Descartes Benjamin Franklin Goethe and others with IQs in the mid 160s or above were superior in their versatility to those attaining lower scores such as George Washington Palestrina or Philip Sheridan   Both Cox and Galton have been criticized for failing to take account of the role of nurture or more specifically socio-economic and educational advantage in the achievements of these historical greats   Cultural approach edit There was one major anthropological study of genius and it was triggered specifically by the author s contentions with Galton s work Configurations of Cultural Growth Kroeber   edit Alfred Kroeber s Configurations of Cultural Growth   looked at many of the same historic greats as did Galton and Cox but from a completely different orientation As a cultural anthropologist Kroeber maintained that in Simonton's words culture takes primacy over the individual in any account of human behavior and that historic geniuses are no exception   To prove his thesis Kroeber collected long lists of notable figures from several nationalities and historic eras and then grouped them within a field and a shared cultural context e g Configuration for American Literature Then within these groupings he listed his notables in strict chronological order identifying the most eminent figures by using capital letters for their surnames e g EMERSON LONGFELLOW POE WHITMAN etc in above configuration   Kroeber found that genius never appeared in isolation but rather in Simonton's words that one genius cluster ed with others of greater and lesser fame in adjacent generations He also found that there were historical crests and troughs in every field   These fluctuations in the appearance of genius were much too rapid to be explained by the simple mechanism of genetic inheritance along family lines   Kroeber argued in Simonton's words that his configurations were due to emulations Geniuses cluster in history because the key figures of one generation emulate those in the immediately preceding generations until it attains a high point of perfection that stymies further growth At this point the tradition degenerates into empty imitation as most creative minds move on to greener pastures   Recent research is consistent with these explanations   but many aspects of the developmental process from birth to the attainment of greatness remain unaccounted for by Kroeber s anthropological approach   Developmental approaches edit Retrospective studies involving extensive interviews with individuals who have attained eminence or at least exceptional levels of achievement have added much to our understanding of the developmental process Two studies in particular stand out Scientific Elite Zuckerman   edit Harriet Zuckerman s Scientific Elite Nobel Laureates in the United States is based on many sources of research evidence including a series of forty-one extended interviews with American winners of the Nobel Prize for science Zuckerman reported her results around two main topics How the Prize is Awarded and Career Development of the Scientific Elite Her findings on the first topic are briefly overviewed in the Wikipedia article regarding the Nobel Prize In relation to the question of the career development of the scientific elite Zuckerman uses the phrase \"accumulation of advantage\" to describe her findings In her words Scientists who show promise early in their careers are given greater opportunities in the way of research training and facilities To the extent that these scientists are as competent as the rest or more so they ultimately will do far better in terms of both role performance and reward rewards which can be transformed into resources for further work and hence over time scientists who are initially advantaged gain even greater opportunities for further achievement and rewards   To see if accumulation of advantage was operating in the career development of the scientific elite Zuckerman compared the careers of future laureates with those of members of the United States National Academy of Sciences and the scientific rank and file along a number of dimensions including socioeconomic origins status of undergraduate and graduate education the process of moving into the scientific elite and first jobs and professorships   She also interviewed forty-one Nobel laureates extensively about their \"apprenticeships\" to \"master\" scientists while they were doing their doctoral research and other aspects of their career development related to the above topics   Zuckerman concluded that evidence of \"accumulative of advantage\" was clearly present over the course of development with result that her research cast s considerable doubt on the conclusion that marked differences in performance between the ultra-elite and other scientists reflect equally marked differences in their initial capacities to do scientific work   Developing Talent in Young People Bloom et al   edit Benjamin Bloom and five colleagues conducted extensive interviews with   young men and women as well as their parents and influential teachers who had reached the highest levels of accomplishment in six fields Olympic sprint swimmers Top   rated professional tennis players concert pianists accomplished sculptors exceptional mathematicians and outstanding research neurologists   They report many findings relevant to the talent development process\" including Development was tied throughout to the values interests resources and personal investments of the family of origin In most families introduction to the field and initial skill development occurred because the p arents or other family members in pursuing their own interests created situations that intrigued interested or involved the child The child s interest was rewarded or encouraged and the parents then provided other ways to extend this interest   The work ethic is central to talent development It is developed by the home environment and directly related to learning and participation in the chosen talent field   Each group of parents strongly encouraged their children s development in a particularly highly approved talent field related to the parents own special interests and gave much less support to other possible talent fields and activities   Families and teachers were crucial at every point along the way to excellence what families and teachers do at different times and how they do it clearly sets the stage for exceptional learning in each talent field   Few of the individuals included in this study were regarded as child prodigies and as a result this research raises serious questions about earlier views of special gifts and innate abilities as necessary prerequisites of talent development   Recent approaches edit A   book by Hans Eysenck argues that a personality trait called Psychoticism is central to becoming a creative genius and a more recent book by Bill Dorris   looks at the influence of everything from genetics to cultural crises including chance over the course of development of those who attain greatness Hans Eysenck 's book Genius The Natural History of Creativity   \"construct s a model of genius and creativity\" whose \"novelty lies in its attempt to make personality differences central to the argument\"   In particular Eysenck is interested in a personality trait called psychoticism chief among whose cognitive features is a tendency to over-inclusiveness i e an inclination not to limit one's associations to relevant ideas memories images etc \"   He considers a massive range of experimental psychological research in order to establish the underlying genetic neuro-chemical mechanisms which may be operating to influence levels of creativity associated with fluctuations in the tendency towards over-inclusiveness indicative of psychoticism \"   Eysenck's assessment of his overall argument is as follows \"There is no hint that the theory is more than a suggestion of how many disparate facts and hypotheses can be pulled together into a causal chain explaining the apogee of human endeavour - genius If the theory has one point in its favour it is that every step can be tested experimentally and that many steps have already received positive support from such testing \"   The Arrival of The Fittest - Dorris   edit This section may contain improper references to self-published sources Please help improve it by removing references to unreliable sources where they are used inappropriately August   Learn how and when to remove this template message Bill Dorris's book The Arrival of The Fittest How The Great Become Great   attempts to address a number of issues which remain unanswered on the subject These include the role of chance over the course of development the importance of the development of unique personal characteristics to achieving greatness and the influence of changes in the wider worlds surrounding the person - from interpersonal to societal - on the course of an individual's development   Dorris argues that those who attain greatness are credited with solving a key generational problem in a field and/or society e g Einstein resolving the conflict between Newton and Maxwell in physics at the outset of the 20th century or Woody Guthrie providing a voice for the outcasts of the Great Depression of the 1930s   Dorris s core argument is that those who become great start out with sufficient genetic potential and then are able over two or more decades to obtain matches/fits with the right kind of problems to extend the development of these genetic biases into what Dorris terms key characteristics These are the intellectual personality and self characteristics which eventually turn out to be required to solve a key generational problem in their field and/or society   Dorris argues that there are four types of matching processes which occur over the course of such development These refer to matches between the developmental needs of the person and the opportunities and resources essential to engaging in problem solving activities that stimulate further development of those aspects of intelligence personality and self which eventually become key characteristics   Two of these matching processes are covered extensively in the existing research literature continuous matching and cumulative matching   The other two of the matching processes described by Dorris are completely new to this book catalytic matching and chaotic matching Dorris s argument in relation to catalytic matching is that anyone who eventually becomes a great will have experienced one or more sustained periods of exceptionally accelerated development of their key characteristics accelerations which serve massively to differentiate them from their former peers in terms of both development and visibility within the field This acceleration occurs because the person becomes the focal point star of a self-reinforcing system of expertise and resources catalytic system which thrives off this person s accelerated development and visibility   Dorris's argument in relation to chaotic matching is that access to the resources and learning opportunities essential to the development of key characteristics of an eventual great often occurs not due to the efforts/planning of the individual but simply due to chance events in the interpersonal institutional or societal worlds around the person who unlike perhaps millions of equally capable peers becomes the beneficiary of these chance events events which Dorris argues can change a person s entire future in much the same way as a lottery jackpot or a Titanic ticket   Dorris documents his theoretical arguments with extensive case studies of a wide

World Business and economics portal v t e The knowledge economy is the use of knowledge savoir savoir-faire savoir- tre to generate tangible and intangible values   Technology and in particular knowledge technology helps to incorporate part of human knowledge into machines   This knowledge can be used by decision support systems in various fields to generate economic value Knowledge economy is also possible without technology   The term was popularized by Peter Drucker as the title of Chapter   in his book The Age of Discontinuity   that Drucker attributed to economist Fritz Machlup originating in the idea of \" scientific management \" developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor   Other than the agricultural-intensive economies and labor-intensive economies the global economy is in transition to a \"knowledge economy\"               as an extension of an \" information society \" in the Information Age led by innovation   The transition requires that the rules and practices that determined success in the industrial economy need rewriting in an interconnected globalized economy where knowledge resources such as trade secrets and expertise are as critical as other economic resources Contents   Concepts   Evolution   Driving forces   Characteristics   Technology     Challenges for developing countries       References   Bibliography     Concepts edit A key concept of the knowledge economy is that knowledge and education often referred to as \" human capital \" can be treated as one of the following two A business product as educational and innovative intellectual products and services can be exported for a high value return A productive asset It can be defined as P roduction and services based on knowledge-intensive activities that contribute to an accelerated pace of technical and scientific advance as well as rapid obsolescence The key component of a knowledge economy is a greater reliance on intellectual capabilities than on physical inputs or natural resources   The initial foundation for the knowledge economy was introduced in   in the book The Effective Executive by Peter Drucker In this book Drucker described the difference between the manual worker page   and the knowledge worker The manual worker according to him works with his or her hands and produces goods or services In contrast a knowledge worker page   works with his or her head not hands and produces ideas knowledge and information The key problem in the formalization and modeling of knowledge economy is a vague definition of knowledge which is a rather relative concept For example it is not proper to consider information society as interchangeable with knowledge society Information is usually not equivalent to knowledge Their use as well depends on individual and group preferences see the cognitive IPK model which are \"economy-dependent\"   Evolution edit The knowledge economy is also seen as the latest stage of development in global economic restructuring Thus far the developed world has transitioned from an agricultural economy pre-Industrial Age largely the agrarian sector to industrial economy with the Industrial Age largely the manufacturing sector to post-industrial / mass production economy mid-1900s largely the service sector to knowledge economy late 1900s 2000s largely the technology / human capital sector This latest stage has been marked by the upheavals in technological innovations and the globally competitive need for innovation with new products and processes that develop from the research community i e R&D factors universities labs educational institutes In the knowledge economy the specialized labor force is characterized as computer literate and well-trained in handling data developing algorithms and simulated models and innovating on processes and systems Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter asserts that today s economy is far more dynamic and that comparative advantage is less relevant than competitive advantage which rests on making more productive use of inputs which requires continual innovation \"   Consequently the technical STEM careers including computer scientists engineers chemists biologists mathematicians and scientific inventors will see continuous demand in years to come Additionally well-situated clusters which Michael Porter argues is vital in global economies connect locally with linked industries manufacturers and other entities that are related by skills technologies and other common inputs Hence knowledge is the catalyst and connective tissue in modern economies With earth s depleting natural resources the need for green infrastructure a logistics industry forced into just-in-time deliveries growing global demand regulatory policy governed by performance results and a host of other items high priority is put on knowledge and research becomes paramount Knowledge provides the technical expertise problem-solving performance measurement and evaluation and data management needed for the transboundary interdisciplinary global scale of today s competition   Worldwide examples of the knowledge economy taking place among many others include Silicon Valley in California aerospace and automotive engineering in Munich Germany biotechnology in Hyderabad India electronics and digital media in Seoul South Korea petrochemical and energy industry in Brazil Many other cities and regions try to follow a knowledge-driven development paradigm and increase their knowledge base by investing in higher education and research institutions in order to attract high skilled labour and better position themselves in the global competition   Yet despite digital tools democratising access to knowledge research shows that knowledge economy activities remain as concentrated as ever in traditional economic cores   It has been suggested that the next evolutionary step after knowledge economy is the network economy where the relatively localized knowledge is now being shared among and across various networks for the benefit of the network members as a whole to gain economic of scale in a wider more open scale It has been hypothesized that the gradual evolution of network economy would create a well interconnected economic order which would then begin to concentrate on the passion of individuals gradually leading to a Passion based economy Driving forces edit Commentators who? suggest there are various interlocking driving forces which are changing the rules of business and national competitiveness Globalization markets and products are more global Information technology which is related to next three Information / Knowledge Intensity efficient production relies on information and know-how many factory workers use their heads more than their hands New Media New media increases the production and distribution of knowledge which in turn results in collective intelligence Existing knowledge becomes much easier to access as a result of networked data-bases which promote online interaction between users and producers Computer networking and Connectivity developments such as the Internet bring the \" global village \" ever nearer As a result goods and services can be developed bought sold and in many cases even delivered over electronic networks As regards the applications of any new technology this depends on how it meets economic demand It can remain dormant or make a commercial breakthrough see diffusion of innovation Characteristics edit It can be argued that the knowledge economy differs from the traditional economy in several key respects The economics are not of scarcity but rather of abundance Unlike most resources that are depleted when used information and knowledge can be shared and actually grow through application The effect of location is either diminished in some economic activities using appropriate technology and methods virtual marketplaces and virtual organizations that offer benefits of speed agility round the clock operation and global reach can be created or on the contrary reinforced in some other economic fields by the creation of business clusters around centres of knowledge such as universities and research centres However clusters already existed in pre-knowledge economy times Laws barriers taxes and ways to measure are difficult to apply solely on a national basis Knowledge and information \"leak\" to where demand is highest and the barriers are lowest Knowledge enhanced products or services can command price premiums over comparable products with low embedded knowledge or knowledge intensity Pricing and value depends heavily on context Thus the same information or knowledge can have vastly different value to different people or even to the same person at different times Knowledge when locked into systems or processes has higher inherent value than when it can \"walk out of the door\" in people's heads Human capital competencies are a key component of value in a knowledge-based company yet few companies report competency levels in annual reports In contrast downsizing is often seen as a positive \"cost cutting\" measure Communication is increasingly being seen as fundamental to knowledge flows Social structures cultural context and other factors influencing social relations are therefore of fundamental importance to knowledge economies These characteristics require new ideas and approaches from policy makers managers and knowledge workers The knowledge economy has manifold forms in which it may appear but there are predictions that the new economy will extend radically creating a pattern in which even ideas will be recognised and identified as a commodity Technology edit The technology requirements for an Innovative System as described by the World Bank Institute must be able to disseminate a unified process by which a working method may converge scientific and technology solutions and organizational solutions   According to the World Bank Institute s definition such innovation would further enable the World Bank Institute s vision outlined in their Millennium Development Goals Challenges for developing countries edit The United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development report UNCSTD   concluded that for developing countries to successfully integrate ICTs and sustainable development in order to participate in the knowledge economy they need to intervene collectively and strategically   Such collective intervention suggested would be in the development of effective national ICT policies that support the new regulatory framework promote the selected knowledge production and use of ICTs and harness their organizational changes to be in line with the Millennium Development Goals The report further suggests that developing countries to develop the required ICT strategies and policies for institutions and regulations taking into account the need to

Anthropologists by nationality Anthropology by year Bibliography Journals List of indigenous peoples Organizations Anthropology portal v t e In cultural anthropology and cultural geography cultural diffusion as conceptualized by Leo Frobenius in his 1897/98 publication Der westafrikanische Kulturkreis is the spread of cultural items such as ideas styles religions technologies languages between individuals whether within a single culture or from one culture to another It is distinct from the diffusion of innovations within a specific culture Examples of diffusion include the spread of the war chariot and iron smelting in ancient times and the use of automobiles and Western business suits in the 20th century Contents   Types   Mechanisms   Theories   Hyperdiffusionism   Medieval Europe   Disputes   Contributors       Notes   References     Types edit Five major types of cultural diffusion have been defined Expansion diffusion an innovation or idea that develops in a source area and remains strong there while also spreading outward to other areas This can include hierarchical stimulus and contagious diffusion Relocation diffusion an idea or innovation that migrates into new areas leaving behind its origin or source of the cultural trait Hierarchical diffusion an idea or innovation that spreads by moving from larger to smaller places often with little regard to the distance between places and often influenced by social elites Contagious diffusion an idea or innovation that spreads based on person-to-person contact within a given population Stimulus diffusion an idea or innovation that spreads based on its attachment to another concept Mechanisms edit Inter-cultural diffusion can happen in many ways Migrating populations will carry their culture with them Ideas can be carried by trans-cultural visitors such as merchants explorers soldiers diplomats slaves and hired artisans Technology diffusion has often occurred by one society luring skilled scientists or workers by payments or other inducement Trans-cultural marriages between two neighboring or interspersed cultures have also contributed Among literate societies diffusion can occur through letters books and in modern times through electronic media There are three categories of diffusion mechanisms Direct diffusion occurs when two cultures are very close to each other resulting in intermarriage trade and even warfare An example of direct diffusion is between the United States and Canada where the people living on the border of these two countries engage in hockey which started in Canada and baseball which is popular in American culture Forced diffusion occurs when one culture subjugates conquers or enslaves another culture and forces its own customs on the conquered people An example would be the forced Christianization of the indigenous peoples of the Americas by the Spanish French English and Portuguese or the forced Islamization of West African peoples by the Fula or of the Nuristanis by the Afghans Indirect diffusion happens when traits are passed from one culture through a middleman to another culture without the first and final cultures being in direct contact An example could be the presence of Mexican food in Canada since a large territory the United States lies between Direct diffusion was common in ancient times when small groups of humans lived in adjoining settlements Indirect diffusion is common in today's world because of the mass media and invention of the Internet Also of interest is the work of American historian and critic Daniel J Boorstin in his book The Discoverers in which he provides an historical perspective on the role of explorers in the diffusion of innovations between civilizations Theories edit The many models that have been proposed for inter-cultural diffusion are Migrationism the spread of cultural ideas by either gradual or sudden population movements Culture circles diffusionism Kulturkreise the theory that cultures originated from a small number of cultures \" Kulturkugel \" a German compound meaning \"culture bullet\" coined by J P Mallory a mechanism suggested by Mallory   to model the scale of invasion vs gradual migration vs diffusion According to this model local continuity of material culture and social organization is stronger than linguistic continuity so that cultural contact or limited migration regularly leads to linguistic changes without affecting material culture or social organization   Hyperdiffusionism the theory that all cultures originated from one culture A concept that has often been mentioned in this regard which may be framed in the evolutionary diffusionism model is that of \"an idea whose time has come\" whereby a new cultural item appears almost simultaneously and independently in several widely separated places after certain prerequisite items have diffused across the respective communities This concept was invoked with regard to the independent development of calculus by Newton and Leibnitz and the inventions of the airplane and of the electronic computer Hyperdiffusionism edit   Hyperdiffusionism in Archaeology Hyperdiffusionists deny that parallel evolution or independent invention took place to any great extent throughout history they claim that all major inventions and all cultures can be traced back to a single culture   Early theories of hyperdiffusionism can be traced to ideas about South America being the origin of mankind Antonio de Le n Pinelo a Spaniard who settled in Bolivia claimed in his book Para so en el Nuevo Mundo that the Garden of Eden and the creation of man had occurred in present-day Bolivia and that the rest of the world was populated by migrations from there Similar ideas were also held by Emeterio Villamil de Rada in his book La Lengua de Ad n he attempted to prove that Aymara was the original language of mankind and that humanity had originated in Sorata in the Bolivian Andes The first scientific defence of humanity originating in South America came from the Argentine paleontologist Florentino Ameghino in   who published his research in La antig edad del hombre en el Plata   The work of Grafton Elliot Smith fomented a revival of hyperdiffusionism in   he asserted that copper producing knowledge spread from Egypt to the rest of the world along with megalithic culture   Smith claimed that all major inventions had been made by the ancient Egyptians and were carried to the rest of the world by migrants and voyagers His views became known as \"Egyptocentric-Hyperdiffusionism\"   William James Perry elaborated on Smith's hypothesis by using ethnographic data Another hyperdiffusionist was Lord Raglan in his book How Came Civilization   he wrote that instead of Egypt all culture and civilization had come from Mesopotamia   Hyperdiffusionism after this did not entirely disappear but it was generally abandoned by mainstream academia Medieval Europe edit Diffusion theory has been advanced according to whom? as an explanation for the \" European miracle \" the adoption of technological innovation in medieval Europe which by the 17th century culminated in European technological achievement surpassing the Islamic world and China   Such technological import to medieval Europe include gunpowder clock mechanisms shipbuilding paper and the windmill however in each of these cases Europeans not only adopted the technologies but improved the manufacturing scale inherent technology and applications to a point clearly surpassing the evolution of the original invention in its country of origin Historians who? have questioned recently year needed whether Europe really owes the development of such inventions as gunpowder the compass the windmill or printing to the Chinese or other cultures       However historian Peter Frankopan argues that influences particularly trade through the middle east & central Asia to China through the silk roads have been overlooked in traditional histories of the \"rise of the west\" He argues that the renaissance was funded with trade with the east due to the demise of Byzantium at the hands of Venice and the 4th Crusade and that the trade allowed ideas and technology to be shared with Europe But the constant warfare and rivalry in Europe meant there was extreme evolutionary pressure for developing these ideas for military and economic advantage and a desperate need to use them in expansion   Disputes edit Further information Migrationism and diffusionism While the concept of diffusion is well accepted in general conjectures about the existence or the extent of diffusion in some specific contexts have been hotly disputed An example of such disputes is the proposal by Thor Heyerdahl that similarities between the culture of Polynesia and the pre-Columbian civilizations of the Andes are due to diffusion from the latter to the former a theory that currently has few supporters among professional anthropologists Heyerdahl's theory of Polynesian origins has not gained acceptance among anthropologists           Contributors edit This section does

is the state of being which occurs when an object service or practice is no longer wanted even though it may still be in good working order Obsolescence frequently occurs because a replacement has become available that has in sum more advantages compared to the disadvantages incurred by maintaining or repairing the original Obsolete refers to something that is already disused or discarded or antiquated   Typically obsolescence is preceded by a gradual decline in popularity Contents   Consequences   Types     Human resource obsolescence     Technical obsolescence     Functional obsolescence     Architectural obsolescence     Planned obsolescence     Style obsolescence     Obsolescence management       References   Further reading     Consequences edit Driven by rapid technological changes new components are developed and launched on the market with increasing speed The result is a dramatic change in production methods of all components and their market availability A growing industry sector is facing issues where life cycles of products no longer fit together with life cycles of required components This issue is known as obsolescence the status given to a part when it is no longer available from its original manufacturer The problem of obsolescence is most prevalent for electronics technology wherein the procurement lifetimes for microelectronic parts are often significantly shorter than the manufacturing and support life cycles for the products that use the parts However obsolescence extends beyond electronic components to other items such as materials textiles and mechanical parts In addition obsolescence has been shown to appear for software specifications standards processes and soft resources such as human skills It is highly important to implement and operate an active management of obsolescence to mitigate and avoid extreme costs   Types edit Human resource obsolescence edit The Homo Sapiens Sapiens replaced the Neanderthal to became the dominant species through superior technology such as agriculture rather then relying on power hungry manual labor of hunter-gatherer tools Even now modern humans triumph over themselves or cannibalize industry of manual labor activities with robotization Technical obsolescence edit Technical obsolescence usually occurs when a new product or technology supersedes the old one and it is preferred to use the new technology instead Historical examples of new technologies superseding old ones include bronze replacing flint in hand-tools DVDs replacing videocassettes and the telephone replacing the telegraph On a smaller scale a particular product may become obsolete when a newer version replaces it Many products in the computer industry become obsolete in this manner For example Central processing units CPU frequently become obsolete in favor of newer faster units Singularly rapid obsolescence of data formats along with their supporting hardware and software can lead to loss of critical information a process known as digital obsolescence In many cases a new technology does totally replace the old technology because the old technology is still useful in certain applications For example transistors replaced vacuum tubes in TV and radio receivers in the 1960s but vacuum tubes were still used for powerful transmitters because transistors for these power levels were not available Even today one has to use multiple transistors for a purpose that used to require just one tube Products may also become obsolete when supporting technologies are no longer available to produce or even repair a product For example many integrated circuits including CPUs memory and even some relatively simple logic chips may no longer be produced because the technology has been superseded their original developer has gone out of business or a competitor has bought them out and effectively killed off their products to remove competition It is rarely worth redeveloping a product to get around these issues since its overall functionality and price/performance ratio has usually been superseded by that time as well Some products become technologically obsolete due to changes in complementary products which results in the function of the first product being made unnecessary For example buggy whips became obsolete when people started to travel in cars rather than in horse-drawn buggies Functional obsolescence edit Items become functionally obsolete when they can no longer adequately perform the function for which they were created For example while one could theoretically adapt an Avro Lancaster to deploy modern JDAM bombs the situations in which it could actually succeed at doing so against modern air defenses would be so few that it would be essentially useless Manufacturers and repair companies will typically cease support for products once they become obsolete as keeping production lines in place and parts in storage for a shrinking user base becomes unprofitable This causes scarcity of spare parts and skilled technicians for repairs and thus escalates maintenance costs for obsolete products This ultimately leads to prohibitive expense in keeping old technology functioning Architectural obsolescence edit The term \"obsolescence\" was first applied to the built environment in   in an attempt to explain American skyscrapers sudden loss of value   New York engineer Reginald P Bolton attributed this phenomenon to \"something new and better out-competing the old\" and calculated the average architectural lifespan of varying building types in order to formulate a rough estimate for their impending obsolescence   For example he suggested that hotel's obsolescence will occur faster than banks due to their ever-changing functions and tastes   Planned obsolescence edit   Planned obsolescence Sometimes marketers deliberately introduce obsolescence into their product strategy with the objective of generating long-term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases One example might be producing an appliance which is deliberately designed to wear out within five years of its purchase pushing consumers to replace it within five years Style obsolescence edit Jimi Hendrix 's bell-bottoms When a product is no longer desirable because it has gone out of the popular fashion its style is obsolete One example is flared leg jeans although this article of clothing may still be perfectly functional it is no longer desirable because style trends have moved away from the flared leg cut Because of the \"fashion cycle\" stylistically obsolete products may eventually regain popularity and cease to be obsolete A current example is \" acid-wash \" jeans which were popular in the 1980s became stylistically obsolete in the mid to late 1990s and returned to popularity in the 2000s Obsolescence management edit   DMSMS Obsolescence management also referred to as \"Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages\" DMSMS is defined as to the activities that are undertaken to mitigate the effects of obsolescence Activities can include last-time buys life-time buys and obsolescence monitoring   edit Look up obsolescence or obsolete in Wiktionary the free dictionary Commodification Deprecation Disruptive innovation DMSMS List of obsolete technology Moore's law

staging of the creative process such as Wallas are primarily theories of creative process A focus on creative product usually appears in attempts to measure creativity psychometrics see below and in creative ideas framed as successful memes   The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more   A focus on the nature of the creative person considers more general intellectual habits such as openness levels of ideation autonomy expertise exploratory behavior and so on A focus on place considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes such as degrees of autonomy access to resources and the nature of gatekeepers Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility   History of the concept edit   History of the concept of creativity Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity preferring to see art as a form of discovery Asked in The Republic \"Will we say of a painter that he makes something?\" Plato answers \"Certainly not he merely imitates \"   Ancient views edit Most ancient cultures including thinkers of Ancient Greece   Ancient China and Ancient India   lacked the concept of creativity seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation The ancient Greeks had no terms corresponding to \"to create\" or \"creator\" except for the expression \" poiein \" \"to make\" which only applied to poiesis poetry and to the poietes poet or \"maker\" who made it Plato did not believe in art as a form of creation Asked in The Republic   \"Will we say of a painter that he makes something?\" he answers \"Certainly not he merely imitates \"   It is commonly argued that the notion of \"creativity\" originated in Western culture through Christianity as a matter of divine inspiration   According to the historian Daniel J Boorstin \"the early Western conception of creativity was the Biblical story of creation given in the Genesis \"   However this is not creativity in the modern sense which did not arise until the Renaissance In the Judaeo-Christian tradition creativity was the sole province of God humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work   A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture for instance Muses were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods   Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative \" daemon \" Greek or \" genius \" Latin linked to the sacred or the divine However none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the Renaissance   It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen not as a conduit for the divine but from the abilities of \" great men \"   The Enlightenment and after edit The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the Renaissance and even later   The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the Renaissance when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual and not God This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time aptly named humanism which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual   From this philosophy arose the Renaissance man or polymath an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation   One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is Leonardo da Vinci However this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment   By the 18th century and the Age of Enlightenment mention of creativity notably in aesthetics linked with the concept of imagination became more frequent   In the writing of Thomas Hobbes imagination became a key element of human cognition   William Duff was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of genius typifying the separation being made between talent productive but breaking no new ground and genius   As a direct and independent topic of study creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century   Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of Darwinism In particular they refer to the work of Francis Galton who through his eugenicist outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence with creativity taken as an aspect of genius   In the late 19th and early 20th centuries leading mathematicians and scientists such as Hermann von Helmholtz   and Henri Poincar   began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes Twentieth century to the present day edit The insights of Poincar and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as Graham Wallas   and Max Wertheimer In his work Art of Thought published in   Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process In the Wallas stage model creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of   stages i preparation preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions ii incubation where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening iii intimation the creative person gets a \"feeling\" that a solution is on its way iv illumination or insight where the creative idea bursts forth from its preconscious processing into conscious awareness v verification where the idea is consciously verified elaborated and then applied Wallas' model is often treated as four stages with \"intimation\" seen as a sub-stage Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the evolutionary process which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments Simonton   provides an updated perspective on this view in his book Origins of genius Darwinian perspectives on creativity In   Alfred North Whitehead gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh later published as Process and Reality   He is credited with having coined the term \"creativity\" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme \"Whitehead actually coined the term our term still the preferred currency of exchange among literature science and the arts a term that quickly became so popular so omnipresent that its invention within living memory and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people quickly became occluded\"   The formal psychometric measurement of creativity from the standpoint of orthodox psychological literature is usually considered to have begun with J P Guilford 's   address to the American Psychological Association which helped popularize the topic   and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as   with the work of H L Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination   but it did not have the same impact Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity as measured as a separate aspect of human cognition to IQ -type intelligence into which it had previously been subsumed Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down   \"Four C\" model edit James C Kaufman and Beghetto introduced a \"four C\" model of creativity mini-c \"transformative learning\" involving \"personally meaningful interpretations of experiences actions and insights\" little-c everyday problem solving and creative expression Pro-C exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent and Big-C creativity considered great in the given field This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity It also the authors argued made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals   The contrast of terms \"Big C\" and \"Little c\" has been widely used Kozbelt Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity   Margaret Boden distinguishes between h-creativity historical and p-creativity personal   Robinson   and Anna Craft   have focused on creativity in a general population particularly with respect to education Craft makes a similar distinction between \"high\" and \"little c\" creativity   and cites Ken Robinson as referring to \"high\" and \"democratic\" creativity Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi   has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative perhaps domain-changing contributions Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity   Theories of creative processes edit There has been much empirical study in psychology and cognitive science of the processes through which creativity occurs Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity Incubation edit Incubation is a temporary break from creative problem solving that can result in insight   There has been some empirical research looking at whether as the concept of \"incubation\" in Wallas ' model implies a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving Ward   lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving and notes how some empirical evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables \"forgetting\" of misleading clues Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become fixated on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem   This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks   This earlier hypothesis is discussed in Csikszentmihalyi 's five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem   Convergent and divergent thinking edit J P Guilford   drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production commonly renamed convergent and divergent thinking Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single correct solution to a problem whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature Other researchers have occasionally used the terms flexible thinking or fluid intelligence which are roughly similar to but not synonymous with creativity citation needed Creative cognition approach edit In   Finke et al proposed the \"Geneplore\" model in which creativity takes place in two phases a generative phase where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts   Weisberg   argued by contrast that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results The Explicit Implicit Interaction EII theory edit Helie and Sun   recently proposed a unified framework for understanding creativity in problem solving namely the Explicit Implicit Interaction EII theory of creativity This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of incubation and insight The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles namely The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing The iterative and possibly bidirectional processing A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the CLARION cognitive architecture and used to simulate relevant human data This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation insight and various other related phenomena Conceptual blending edit   Conceptual blending In The Act of Creation Arthur Koestler introduced the concept of bisociation that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference   This idea was later developed into conceptual blending In the 1990s various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with metaphor analogy and structure mapping have been converging and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science art and humor has emerged under the label conceptual blending Honing theory edit Honing theory developed principally by psychologist Liane Gabora posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing self-mending nature of a worldview The creative process is a way in which the individual hones and re-hones an integrated worldview Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process When faced with a creatively demanding task there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview and the worldview changes through interaction with the task This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete at which point not only is the task conceived of differently but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components whether they be ideas attitudes or bits of knowledge A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state   Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly mutating predefined possibilities but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task Thus the creative idea may feel half-baked It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity for example how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise but it is predicted by honing theory according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive nurturing trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization However research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity which would stimulate honing Everyday imaginative thought edit In everyday thought people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think \"if only \"   Their counterfactual thinking is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes   It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought   Assessing individual creative ability edit Creativity quotient edit Several attempts have been made to develop a creativity quotient of an individual similar to the intelligence quotient IQ however these have been unsuccessful   Psychometric approach edit J P Guilford 's group   which pioneered the modern psychometric study of creativity constructed several tests to measure creativity in   Plot Titles where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness Figure Concepts where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings these were scored for uncommonness Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks Remote Associations where participants are asked to find a word between two given words e g Hand Call Remote Consequences where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events e g loss of gravity Building on Guilford's work Torrance   developed the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking in     They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills which were scored on Fluency The total number of interpretable meaningful and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus Originality The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects Elaboration The amount of detail in the responses The Creativity Achievement Questionnaire a self-report test that measures creative achievement across   domains was described in   and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output   Besides the English original it was also used in a Chinese   French   and German-speaking   version It is the self-report questionnaire used most frequently in research   Such tests sometimes called Divergent Thinking DT tests have been both supported   and criticized   Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of divergent thinking tests using semantic approach When compared to human raters NLP techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality when compared to human raters     The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of     and     respectively to human graders Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures   Most recently an NSF-funded   team of researchers led by James C Kaufman and Mark A Runco   combined expertise in creativity research natural language processing computational linguistics and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system This system enabled automated scoring of DT tests that is reliable objective and scalable thus addressing most of the issues of DT tests that had been found and reported   The resultant computer system was able to achieve a correlation of     to human graders   Social-personality approach edit Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity In these studies personality traits such as independence of judgement self-confidence attraction to complexity aesthetic orientation and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals   A meta-analysis by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be \"more open to new experiences less conventional and less conscientious more self-confident self-accepting driven ambitious dominant hostile and impulsive \" Openness conscientiousness self-acceptance hostility and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed   Within the framework of the Big Five model of personality some consistent traits have emerged   Openness to experience has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity   Among the other Big Five traits research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity Compared to non-artists artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness while scientists are more open to experience conscientious and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists   Creativity and intelligence edit The potential relationship between creativity and intelligence has been of interest since the late 1900s when a multitude of influential studies from Getzels & Jackson   Barron   Wallach & Kogan   and Guilford   focused not only on creativity but also on intelligence This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related but also how and why   There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship with the   main theories as follows Threshold Theory Intelligence is a necessary but not sufficient condition for creativity There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120     Certification Theory Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence Instead individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence   Interference Theory Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability   Sternberg and O Hara   proposed a framework of   possible relationships between creativity and intelligence Creativity is a subset of intelligence Intelligence is a subset of creativity Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct coincident sets Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs disjoint sets Creativity as a subset of intelligence edit A number of researchers include creativity either explicitly or implicitly as a key component of intelligence Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence Gardner s Theory of multiple intelligences MIT   implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT To demonstrate this Gardner cited examples of different famous creators each of whom differed in their types of intelligences e g Picasso spatial intelligence Freud intrapersonal Einstein logical-mathematical and Gandhi interpersonal Sternberg s Theory of Successful intelligence       see Triarchic theory of intelligence includes creativity as a main component and comprises   sub-theories Componential Analytic Contextual Practical and Experiential Creative Experiential sub-theory the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems is directly related to creativity The Cattell Horn Carroll theory includes creativity as a subset of intelligence Specifically it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval Glr Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include   ideational fluency associational fluency and originality/creativity Silvia et al   conducted a study to look at the relationship between divergent thinking and verbal fluency tests and reported that both fluency and originality in divergent thinking were significantly affected by the broad level Glr factor Martindale   extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages and as the individual begins to understand the problem the processing speed is increased The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence   posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence Type   is a conscious process and concerns goal directed thoughts which are explained by g Type   is an unconscious process and concerns spontaneous cognition which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type   and Type   processes working together in combination The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees Intelligence as a subset of creativity edit In this relationship model intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity Sternberg & Lubart s Investment Theory     Using the metaphor of a stock market they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors they buy low and sell high in their ideas Like under/low-valued stock creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people The creative individual has to persevere and convince the others of the ideas value After convincing the others and thus increasing the ideas value the creative individual sells high by leaving the idea with the other people and moves onto generating another idea According to this theory six distinct but related elements contribute to successful creativity intelligence knowledge thinking styles personality motivation and environment Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely or in conjunction with the other five factors generate creative thoughts Amabile s Componential Model of Creativity     In this model there are   within-individual components needed for creativity domain-relevant skills creativity-relevant processes and task motivation and   component external to the individual their surrounding social environment Creativity requires a confluence of all components High creativity will result when an individual is intrinsically motivated possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking and is working in a highly creative environment Amusement Park Theoretical Model   In this 4-step theory both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels intelligence plays a key role To get into the amusement park there are initial requirements e g time/transport to go to the park Initial requirements like intelligence are necessary but not sufficient for creativity They are more like prerequisites for creativity and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement intelligence then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour Secondly are the subcomponents general thematic areas that increase in specificity Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit e g a zoo or a water park these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative e g poetry Thirdly there are specific domains After choosing the type of park to visit e g waterpark you then have to choose which specific park to go to Within the poetry domain there are many different types e g free verse riddles sonnet etc that have to be selected from Lastly there are micro-domains These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e g individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs edit This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct but intersecting constructs Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs Renzulli s Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness   In this conceptualisation giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability creativity and task commitment Under this view creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs but they do overlap under the correct conditions PASS theory of intelligence In this theory the planning component relating to the ability to solve problems make decisions and take action strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity   Threshold Theory TT A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120 Above this threshold of an IQ of   if there is a relationship at all it is small and weak       TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity In support of the TT Barron     reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample Yamamoto   in a sample of secondary school children reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of r =   and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children Fuchs-Beauchamp et al   in a sample of preschoolers found that creativity and intelligence correlated from r =   to r =   in the group of children who had an IQ below the threshold and in the group above the threshold the correlations were r = <   Cho et al   reported a correlation of   between creativity and intelligence in the average IQ group of a sample of adolescents and adults and a correlation of close to r =   for the high IQ group Jauk et al   found support for the TT but only for measures of creative potential not creative performance Much modern day research reports findings against TT Wai et al   in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood found that differences in SAT scores at age   were predictive of creative real-life outcomes   years later Kim s   meta-analysis of   studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence creativity and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of   Preckel et al   investigating fluid intelligence and creativity reported small correlations of r =   to r =   across all levels of cognitive ability Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets edit Under this view researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving and in normal problem solving there is no need for creativity Thus creativity and Intelligence problem solving are the same thing Perkins   referred to this as the nothing-special view Weisberg & Alba   examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem see Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle where the participants are asked to connect all   dots in the   rows of   dots using   straight lines or less without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight they still found it difficult to solve the problem thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight or creativity that is required Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets edit In this view creativity and intelligence are completely different unrelated constructs Getzels and Jackson   administered   creativity measures to a group of   children from grades 6-12 and compared these test findings to results from previously administered by the school IQ tests They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was r =   The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers The high intelligence group scored the opposite they scored in the top 20% for IQ but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated However this work has been heavily criticised Wallach and Kogan   highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills McNemar   noted that there were major measurement issues in that the IQ scores were a mixture from   different IQ tests Wallach and Kogan   administered   measures of creativity each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency and   measures of general intelligence to   5th grade children These tests were untimed and given in a game-like manner aiming to facilitate creativity Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average r =   Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average r =   with each other Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated r =   Neuroscience edit The neuroscience of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour It has been addressed   in the article \"Creative Innovation Possible Brain Mechanisms \" The authors write that \"creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected \" Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways they have a high level of specialized knowledge they are capable of divergent thinking mediated by the frontal lobe and they are able to modulate neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine in their frontal lobe Thus the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the cortex that is most important for creativity This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep mood and addiction disorders and depression In   Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive Drawing from evidence in brain imaging drug studies and lesion analysis she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes the temporal lobes and dopamine from the limbic system The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation Abnormalities in the frontal lobe such as depression or anxiety generally decrease creativity while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe and vice versa High dopamine levels increase general arousal and goal directed behaviors and reduce latent inhibition and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas   A   study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks including those that support associative thinking along with other default mode network functions   Working memory and the cerebellum edit Vandervert   described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the cerebellum collaborate to produce creativity and innovation Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of working memory responsible for processing all thought   are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum   The cerebellum consisting of   billion neurons which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain   is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes   where creative and innovative thoughts arise   Apparently creative insight or the \"aha\" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe   According to Vandervert the details of creative adaptation begin in \"forward\" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control HMOSAIC   New hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture HMOSAIC develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion   Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports art music the design of video games technology mathematics the child prodigy and thought in general Essentially Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed fractionated by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem   Most recently he has argued that this is the same process only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization that led to the evolution of language in humans   Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process because it continuously optimizes efficiencies constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas music art or technology   Prototyping they argue not only produces new products it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself Further Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive \"mental prototyping\" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the Khan Academy The model proposed by Vandervert has however received incisive critique from several authors     REM sleep edit Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement Sleep aids this process   REM rather than NREM sleep appears to be responsible     This has been suggested to be due to changes in cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation that occurs during REM sleep   During this period of sleep high levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampus suppress feedback from the hippocampus to the neocortex and lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the spread of associational activity within neocortical areas without control from the hippocampus   This is in contrast to waking consciousness where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing \"neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes \"   Affect edit Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence As noted in voting behavior the term \"affect\" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making   Positive affect relations edit According to Alice Isen positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated Together these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity Barbara Fredrickson in her broaden-and-build model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions thus enhancing creativity According to these researchers positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association attention scope and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem cognitive scope Various meta-analyses such as Baas et al   of   studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect     Creativity and artificial intelligence edit J rgen Schmidhuber 's formal theory of creativity     postulates that creativity curiosity and interestingness are by-products of a simple computational principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own sensory inputs The agent can use a black box optimization method such as reinforcement learning to learn through informed trial and error sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future reward signals There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals such as finding food when hungry But Schmidhuber's objective function to be maximized also includes an additional intrinsic term to model \"wow-effects \" This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals A wow-effect is formally defined as follows As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs it keeps improving the predictor or encoder which can be implemented as an artificial neural network or some other machine learning device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time The improvements can be measured precisely by computing the difference in computational costs storage size number of required synapses errors time needed to encode new observations before and after learning This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge which changes over time but the theory formally takes this into account The cost difference measures the strength of the present \"wow-effect\" due to sudden improvements in data compression or computational speed It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects Irregular random data or noise do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress and thus are \"boring\" by nature providing no reward Already known and predictable regularities also are boring Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown novel regular patterns in both actions and observations This motivates the agent to perform continual open-ended active creative exploration According to Schmidhuber his objective function explains the activities of scientists artists and comedians     For example physicists are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished physical laws permitting better data compression Likewise composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements Similarly a comedian gets intrinsic reward for \"inventing a novel joke with an unexpected punch line related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data \"   Schmidhuber argues that ongoing computer hardware advances will greatly scale up rudimentary artificial scientists and artists clarification needed based on simple implementations of the basic principle since     He used the theory to create low-complexity art   and an attractive human face   Mental health edit   Creativity and mental illness A study by psychologist J Philippe Rushton found creativity to correlate with intelligence and psychoticism   Another study found creativity to be greater in schizotypal than in either normal or schizophrenic individuals While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the prefrontal cortex schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their right prefrontal cortex   This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate In agreement with this hypothesis ambidexterity is also associated with schizotypal and schizophrenic individuals Three recent studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal     and hypomanic personality   and several different measures of creativity Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and mood disorders particularly manic-depressive disorder a k a bipolar disorder and depressive disorder a k a unipolar disorder In Touched with Fire Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament Kay Redfield Jamison summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in writers poets and artists She also explores research that identifies mood disorders in such famous writers and artists as Ernest Hemingway who shot himself after electroconvulsive treatment Virginia Woolf who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on composer Robert Schumann who died in a mental institution and even the famed visual artist Michelangelo A study looking at     persons with schizophrenia bipolar disorder or unipolar depression and their relatives found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder There was no overall overrepresentation but overrepresentation for artistic occupations among those diagnosed with schizophrenia There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives   Another study involving more than one million people conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders schizophrenia unipolar depression and substance abuse and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder   However as a group those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder including anorexia and to some extent autism the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports   According to psychologist Robert Epstein PhD creativity can be obstructed through stress   Creativity and personality edit Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms depending on unique people and environments A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth innovation speed etc These are referred to as the four \"Creativity Profiles\" that can help achieve such goals   i Incubate Long-term Development ii Imagine Breakthrough Ideas iii Improve Incremental Adjustments iv Invest Short-term Goals Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at Manchester Business School has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each i \"Idea Generation\" Fluency Originality Incubation and Illumination ii \"Personality\" Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity iii \"Motivation\" Intrinsic Extrinsic and Achievement iv \"Confidence\" Producing Sharing and Implementing This model was developed in a sample of   working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling   An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual as characterised by the psychometric approach and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference   One characteristic of creative people as measured by some psychologists is what is called divergent production Divergent production is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation   One way of measuring divergent production is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking   The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity quantity and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area become experts in their fields and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways In a study of projects by design students students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects   The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person Motivation stems from two different sources intrinsic and extrinsic motivation Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest desires hopes goals etc Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment rewards fame approval from others etc Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people   From a personality-traits perspective there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people   Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences are more self-confident are more ambitious self-accepting impulsive driven dominant and hostile compared to people with less creativity From an evolutionary perspective creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas As ideas are continuously generated the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments As a result people have been creating and developing new innovative and creative ideas to build our progress as a society   In studying exceptionally creative people in history some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found Creative people in history usually had supportive parents but rigid and non-nurturing Most had an interest in their field at an early age and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination   Another theory of creative people is the investment theory of creativity This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity In the investment sense a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea Just like in the financial world some investments are worth the buy in while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected This investment theory of creativity views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way   Malevolent creativity edit Malevolent creativity MC focuses on the \"darker side\" of creativity   This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism However MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying cheating and betrayal   Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving The personality traits of physical aggression conscientiousness emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC   Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating those high in implicit aggression even if they were high in impulsiveness were far less destructive in their imagined solutions They concluded premeditation more than implicit aggression controlled an individual s expression of malevolent creativity   The current measure for malevolent creativity is the   item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale MCBS   Malevolent creativity and crime edit Malevolent creativity has strong links with crime As creativity requires deviating from the conventional there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime   Creativity across cultures edit Creativity is viewed differently in different countries   For example cross-cultural research centred on Hong Kong found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person such as their aesthetic taste while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e g what they can contribute to society   Mpofu et al surveyed   African languages and found that   had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' the exception being Arabic   The principle of linguistic relativity i e that language can affect thought suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages However more research would be needed to establish this and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less or more creative Africa has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as music art and storytelling Nevertheless it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa   and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America   Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere but here again there are cultural differences even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity For example in Scandinavian countries creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges   while in Germany creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems   In organizations edit Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in Brazil The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent For any given organization measures of effectiveness vary depending upon its mission environmental context nature of work the product or service it produces and customer demands Thus the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself how it functions how it is structured and what it emphasizes Amabile   argued that to enhance creativity in business three components were needed Expertise technical procedural and intellectual knowledge Creative thinking skills how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems and Motivation especially intrinsic motivation There are two types of motivation extrinsic motivation external factors for example threats of being fired or money as a reward intrinsic motivation comes from inside an individual satisfaction enjoyment of work etc Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are Challenge matching people with the right assignments Freedom giving people autonomy choosing means to achieve goals Resources such as time money space etc There must be balance fit among resources and people Work group features diverse supportive teams where members share the excitement willingness to help and recognize each other's talents Supervisory encouragement recognitions cheering praising Organizational support value emphasis information sharing collaboration Nonaka who examined several successful Japanese companies similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations   In particular he emphasized the role that tacit knowledge has to play in the creative process In business originality is not enough The idea must also be appropriate useful and actionable     Creative competitive intelligence is a new solution to solve this problem According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to innovation process and competitive intelligence to creative workers Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace It is essential for innovation and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses In   the sociologist Silvia Leal Mart n using the Innova 3DX method suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation corporate culture work environment leadership and management creativity self-esteem and optimism locus of control and learning orientation motivation and fear   Similarly social psychologists organizational scientists and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition team processes and organizational culture as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation         The investigation by Loo     on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page It offers connections with the sections on the Four C model Theories of creative processes Creativity as a subset of intelligence Creativity and personality and In organisations It is the last section that the investigation addresses Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels macro meso and micro Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension Meso studies focus on organisations Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses e g Burton-Jones   Drucker   economics e g Cortada   Reich   Florida   education e g Farrell and Fenwick   Brown Lauder and Ashton   human resource management e g Davenport   knowledge and organizational management Alvesson   Defillippi Arthur and Lindsay   Orr Nutley Russell Bain Hacking and Moran   sociology psychology and knowledge economy-related sectors especially information technology IT software e g O Riain   Nerland   and advertising e g Grabher   Lury   Loo   Loo   studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives Specifically the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting in advertising and systems software developing and software programme managing The study offers a conceptual framework Loo   p   of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles and single and multi-contexts The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics e g Reich   Quah   management e g Drucker   Nonaka and Takeuchi   von Hippel   sociology e g Zuboff   Bell   Lash and Urry   Castells   Knorr Cetina   and psychology e g Gardner   Csikszentmihalyi   Sternberg Kaufman and Pretz   The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work These workers apply their cognitive abilities creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science technology or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities e g a medium product or service These work activities may be done individually or collectively Education training and encultured environments are necessary for the performance of these creative activities Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person seeking novelty when reviewing a situation Gardner   and creating something that is different and novel i e a variation on the idea of existing ideas in a domain Csikszentmihalyi   This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives This investigation identifies a definition of creative work three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination problem-solving problem seeking and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example for a creative director in the advertising industry it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens and for a software programmer it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector In addition to the creative applications creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles Passion for one s job is generic For copywriters this passion is identified with fun enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty regarding the product confidence and patience in finding the appropriate copy Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities e g literature the creative arts e g painting and music and technical-related know-how e g mathematics computer sciences and physical sciences In the IT software technical knowledge of computer languages e g C+++ is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers There are three types of work One is intra-sectoral e g general sponge and in tune with the zeitgeist advertising and power of expression and sensitivity IT software The second is inter-sectoral e g integration of advertising activities advertising and autonomous decentralized systems ADS IT software The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors e g three-dimensional trust and green credentials advertising and collaboration with HEIs and industry and ADS system in the Tokyo train operator IT software The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information communications and electronic technologies ICET infrastructure training work environment and education This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure delivery approaches and assessments At a macro level governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development formally and informally and foster an environment which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation Team Composition Diversity between team members backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways However under some conditions diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives   Thus the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity             Team Processes Team communication norms such as respecting others expertise paying attention to others ideas expecting information sharing tolerating disagreements negotiating remaining open to others ideas learning from others and building on each other s ideas increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with brainstorming and problem solving Through these processes team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge reach shared understandings identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks and make new connections between ideas Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team affect which facilitates collective creativity         Organizational Culture Supportive and motivational environments that create psychological safety by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well         Organizations in which help-seeking help giving and collaboration are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur   Additionally leadership styles that downplay status hierarchies or power differences within an organization and empower people to speak up about their ideas or opinions also help to create cultures that are conducive to creativity         Economic views of creativity edit Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects the impact of creativity on economic growth methods of modelling markets for creativity and the maximisation of economic creativity innovation In the early 20th century Joseph Schumpeter introduced the economic theory of creative destruction to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new Some economists such as Paul Romer view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and consequently economic growth Creativity leads to capital and creative products are protected by intellectual property laws Mark A Runco and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a \" psychoeconomic \" model of creativity   In such a model creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive utility and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations   The creative class is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies In his   book The Rise of the Creative Class economist Richard Florida popularized the notion that regions with \"3 T's of economic development Technology Talent and Tolerance\" also have high concentrations of creative professionals and tend to have a higher level of economic development Fostering creativity edit   Creativity techniques Daniel Pink in his   book A Whole New Mind repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important In this conceptual age we will need to foster and encourage right-directed thinking representing creativity and emotion over left-directed thinking representing logical analytical thought However this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data   Nickerson   provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry Establishing purpose and intention Building basic skills Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration Building motivation especially internal motivation Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks Focusing on mastery and self-competition Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity Providing opportunities for choice and discovery Developing self-management metacognitive skills Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance Providing balance Some see the conventional system of schooling as \"stifling\" of creativity and attempt particularly in the preschool / kindergarten and early school years to provide a creativity-friendly rich imagination-fostering environment for young children       Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise   In addition to helping with problem solving creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so       See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating valued for its own sake         To promote creative thinking educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks     Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it         Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual Such ideas range from the psychological -cognitive such as Osborn - Parnes Creative Problem Solving Process Synectics science-based creative thinking Purdue Creative Thinking Program and Edward de Bono 's lateral thinking to the highly structured such as TRIZ the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving developed by the Russian scientist Genrich Altshuller and Computer-Aided morphological analysis

 navigation search Innovation leadership is a philosophy and technique that combines different leadership styles to influence employees to produce creative ideas products and services The key role in the practice of innovation leadership is the innovation leader   Dr David Gliddon   developed the competency model of innovation leaders and established the concept of innovation leadership at Penn State University As an approach to organization development innovation leadership can support achievement of the mission or the vision of an organization or group With new technologies and processes it is necessary for organizations to think innovatively to ensure continued success and stay competitive           to adapt to new changes The need for innovation in organizations has resulted in a new focus on the role of leaders in shaping the nature and success of creative efforts   Without innovation leadership organizations are likely to struggle   This new call for innovation represents the shift from the 20th century traditional view of organizational practices which discouraged employee innovative behaviors to the 21st-century view of valuing innovative thinking as a potentially

References Overview edit To have a clear understanding of what innovation leadership involves one must first understand the concept of innovation Although there is some controversy over how it can be defined through general consensus in the literature it can be described as novel ideas of viable products that are put into operation   It includes three different stages which are all dynamic and iterative constant Idea Generation Evaluation Implementation The two types of innovation include exploratory innovation which involves generating brand new ideas and value-added innovation which involves modifying and improving ideas that already exist         Ideas generated must be useful to be considered innovative Innovation should also not be confused with creativity which is merely the generation of a novel idea that may not necessarily be put into operation though these words are sometimes used interchangeably in research literature when speaking about innovation leadership Innovation leadership is a complex concept as there is no single explanation or formula for a leader to follow to increase innovation As a result innovation leadership encompasses a variety of different activities actions and behaviors that interact to produce an innovative outcome Value-added Innovation edit Exploratory and value-added innovation require different leadership styles and behaviors to succeed   Value-added innovation PwC   involves refining and revising an existing product or service and typically requires minimal risk taking compared to exploratory innovation which often involves taking a large risk in this case it is most appropriate for a leader for innovation to adopt a transactional form of leadership     This is because a transactional leadership style does not use open leadership behaviors such as encouraging employees to experiment and take risks but rather uses closed leadership behaviors that do not condone or reward risk-taking Companies whose innovation leaders use transactional leadership for value-added innovation purposes include Toyota Motor Co General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co   examples of these companies value-added innovations such as making improvements on existing cars by making them faster more comfortable and getting better gas mileage Occasionally a value-added innovation may require a completely new way of thinking and possibly taking new risks An example of this scenario can be illustrated through Aspirin this was an existing product traditionally used as an analgesic to alleviate aches and pains but has been introduced into a new and different market by extending its uses to help prevent heart attack and reduce blot clot formation In this example the usage of an existing product was re-worked and introduced into a new market While an existing product is being changed and/or improved upon characterizing it as a value-added innovation outside-the-box thinking research and risk-taking are now required since it is being introduced into a new market In this case a transformational leadership style is a more appropriate style to use The innovation leader must gauge if and how much risk and radical thinking are involved in the value-added innovation to determine which leadership style to use in a situation The leader must be flexible able to switch leadership behaviors when necessary Exploratory Innovation edit Exploratory innovation refers to the generation of novel ideas strategies and solutions through the use of strictly open behaviors exhibited most often by transformational leaders The foundation of exploratory innovation is characterized by search discovery experimentation and risk taking It is the organization s focus on generating new ideas products and strategies in contrast to exploitative innovation which focuses on building and extending already existing ideas Some studies have shown that explorative and exploitative innovation require different structures strategies processes capabilities and cultures   See Innovative Organizational Climate/Culture Exploratory innovation requires flexibility opportunism adaptability and for leaders to provide intellectual stimulation to their subordinates   In this approach to innovation the leadership style that is primarily used is transformational The behaviors exhibited are believed to achieve the desired creative outcome from employees through the application of individualized consideration charisma and inspirational motivation For example in one study of the innovation practices at AXA Insurance in Ireland the CEO John O Neil engaged in transformational leadership behaviors and introduced the MadHouse program that combined workers from different departments and levels of the organization to work together in a creative way The result of this experiment after six months was   new business ideas for products and services   Explorative and Value-added innovation are often referenced together but surprisingly little research shows an interaction between the two However there is an understanding that in some circumstances a balance must be attained to achieve superior employee performance   For example not all novel ideas are implemented and may be resurrected later The organization may need to switch gears and adopt exploitative strategies to revise and refine the idea to match present needs Foundations of Innovation Leadership edit Innovation leadership has roots in path-goal theory and leader-member exchange theory Certain elements within an organization are also needed for innovation leadership to succeeded Wolfe     as cited by Sarros Cooper & Santora     has pointed out that one antecedent factor for innovation is organizational culture Likewise Isaksen Laver Ekvail & Britz     concur that innovative endeavors fail without a supportive climate This antecedent of a supportive organizational culture/climate encompasses encouragement of creativity autonomy resources and pressures Additional foundational elements for innovation leadership include creative work a creative workforce and certain leader attributes   Roots in Path-Goal Theory edit The basis of path-goal theory uses a similar view of leadership in that it advocates different types of leadership e g participative supportive behaviors much like innovation leadership does However it is contingent on employee and environmental factor to be effective     The idea of a single leader using different leadership behaviors originated in path-goal theory and has been associated with the framework underlying innovation leadership which also allows the creation of a work environment conducive to innovative thinking which is the cognitive process of generating novel and useful ideas Creating this type of work environment through innovation leadership involves open leadership behaviors that resemble some leader behaviors proposed by Path-goal theory for example upward influence and supportive/considerate behaviors   In innovation leadership these behaviors encourage the creative team to generate as many novel ideas as possible and lead to evaluation and implementation of these ideas   Roots in Leader-Member Exchange Theory edit Leader-member exchange theory LMX theory is another one of the building blocks of innovation leadership It follows the same idea as Path-goal theory and innovation leadership that multiple leadership styles are necessary in managing multiple subordinates but takes it a step further LMX involves adopting a unique leadership style for each employee Past studies indicate that LMX theory has been shown to have an effect on innovation     Studies have also shown that leader-member exchange relationships can predict significant organizational and attitudinal variables including higher job satisfaction and higher job performance Basu and Green     found that innovative behavior is related to the quality of the leader-member exchange where high quality exchanges include contributions from both the leader and the follower However in a study by Jean Lee     only the loyalty aspect of LMX LMXL was shown to be related to innovativeness Leadership styles transformational positively related and transactional negatively related were found to have an effect on innovativeness Innovative Organizational Culture/Climate edit Some studies have shown evidence of organizational culture as the mediator of the relationship between transformational leadership and organizational innovation         and performance     In other words for transformational leadership to affect organizational innovation an organization must have a strong innovative culture in addition to a leader with a transformational leadership style Organizational culture refers to an organization's deep structure normative beliefs and shared behavioral expectations This culture is fairly constant and can influence interorganizational relations Climate refers to the way that individuals perceive the extent to which the organizational culture impacts them The two essentially are interrelated One proposed model for assessing a creative environment in organizations includes the following dimensions   Encouragement of Creativity edit Encouragement of creativity is the most frequently mentioned dimension in the literature It operates at three major levels each level containing multiple aspects Conceptual Model Underlying Assessment of Perceptions of the Work Environment for Creativity   Organizational Encouragement edit The first level is Organizational Encouragement This involves encouragement of risk-taking and idea generation from all levels of management fair and supportive evaluation of new ideas recognition and reward of creativity and collaborative idea flow across an organization Each of these are equally important aspects of organizational encouragement but the third aspect recognition and reward of creativity may have adverse effects if the sole purpose for engaging in an activity is to gain reward Supervisory Encouragement edit The second level Supervisory Encouragement highlights the roles of supervisors and project managers in goal clarity open interaction between supervisors and subordinates and supervisory support of a team s work and ideas This level of encouragement points to the concepts of transformational leadership and LMX that emphasise the importance of the interactions of supervisors and subordinates in innovative performance Work Group Encouragement edit The third level of encouragement is Work Group Encouragement Diversity in team members backgrounds and openness to ideas affects creativity because individuals are exposed to a variety of novel and unusual ideas and such exposure had been demonstrated to have a positive effect on creative thinking   Autonomy edit Autonomy is believed to foster creativity since studies have revealed that individuals produce more creative work and experience increased intrinsic motivation when they have a sense of control and ownership over their work and ideas and they perceive themselves as having a choice in how their goals are accomplished whether those goals are given to them by their supervisor or chosen by themselves Resources edit Resources have been suggested to be directly related to creativity in organizations Individuals perceptions of the availability of resources may lead to increased beliefs of the likelihood that the ideas they generate have a possibility of reaching the implementation stage Pressures edit The little evidence that exists on the dimension of pressure suggests somewhat paradoxical influences Some degree of pressure could have a positive effect if the pressure originates from the challenging and intellectual nature of the task itself increasing intrinsic motivation However if the pressure experienced is perceived extreme it could counteract creativity Amabile et al     identify two forms of pressure excessive workload pressure and challenge They suggest that the first should have a negative influence on creativity while the second should have a positive one Organizational Impediments to Creativity edit Although there has been little research on the work of environment factors that undermine creativity some research suggests that these impediments include internal strife conservatism and rigid formal management structures within organizations     This dimension is seen as working against autonomy and tends to have an inverse effect as individuals may perceive a more controlling environment   Creative Work edit Creative work can occur at any job but more specifically it can occur in jobs where there are complicated ill-defined problems requiring innovative solutions         The fact that the creative problems are ill-defined makes the creative work uncertain and it may involve risky efforts   It is also resource intensive demanding and time consuming work   requiring high levels of motivation     and often requires collaboration       This type of work must also involve both novel idea generation and novel idea implementation   and requires expertise on the part of the workforce   Creative Workforce edit A creative workforce is needed for innovation leadership to be successful Creative people have expertise on the subject requiring innovation and tend to use work as a source of identity   Because of this they are powerfully intrinsically motivated by professional achievement opportunities and recognition Creative workers are also commonly characterized as highly valuing their autonomy additional dispositional attributes include openness flexibility cognitive complexity self-confidence dominance and introversion     The patterns of characteristics creative workers exhibit typically allow them to confidently explore alternative ideas under ambiguous conditions   Leader Attributes/Characteristics edit Successful innovation leadership requires a leader with certain characteristics These include expertise in the domain creativity ability to carry out transformational leadership behaviors planning and sense-making and social skills   Innovative leaders can be recruited and hired through professional networks and referrals or alternatively found through succession planning which involves identifying innovative leaders who are already working within the organization   Types of Innovation Leadership Styles edit In addition to these foundations various   styles play an important role in innovation leadership each of which are used at different stages of the innovation process or for different types of innovation value-added vs exploratory Frequently associated leadership styles include transformational leadership     transactional leadership       and Ambidextrous leadership   The type of leadership most strongly associated with innovation is transformational leadership   Key Activities of Innovation Leadership edit Idea Generation edit As mentioned above different leadership styles and behaviors may be more appropriate at different stages of the innovation process Current research supports the notion that in the idea generation process innovation leadership requires a leader to use a more transformational style of leadership   During this stage a leader needs to promote a safe environment for employees/team members to voice novel ideas and original thinking as well as provide workers with the resources to do so effectively   Research has also found that leaders who engage in unconventional behaviors associated with transformational leadership were seen as stronger role models and as a result increase creative performance in their subordinates For example the founders of Google have been known to wear capes and jump-shoes around the office     thus inspiring more outside-the-box thinking in their employees These open leadership behaviors convey that unorthodox and unconventional ideas and behaviors are not only accepted but also encouraged Idea Evaluation and Implementation edit In addition to providing a climate for idea generation innovation leadership also requires leaders to ensure that the process of idea generation does not overshadow the evaluation and implementation processes During these phases of leadership leaders must support some ideas while discarding other ideas and put the supported ideas into production The role of the leader must shift away from a transformational style to a more transactional style of leadership which involves being more direct and critical toward the ideas generated A leader now needs to ensure that constructive discussions of innovative ideas are taking place among their subordinates This serves to evaluate the usefulness of each idea eliminate those that do not appear viable to the organization or goal and push the ones that do appear viable into the production phase The leader must adopt what are known as closed leadership behaviors to achieve this Instead of stimulating idea generation the leader must shift focus from generating new ideas toward fine-tuning existing ideas to achieve progress toward the goal and ultimately implement the idea This challenge of balancing differing leadership styles when appropriate is called the generator evaluator paradox It is important to consider the role of ambidextrous leadership since a leader must be able to switch between leadership roles and styles when necessary to successfully lead for innovation Paradoxes of innovation leadership are discussed below Innovation Leadership and Influence edit Depending on the type of leadership style that is adopted by the innovation leader the leader may have either a direct or indirect influence on your employees Direct Influences edit Direct forms of influence in leading innovation include providing creative input and idea suggestion to employees providing employees with clear and concrete goals allocating organizational resources i e research and development spending manpower for implementing ideas Indirect Influences edit Indirect influences get the same results without providing explicit guidance to employees These types of influences include establishing a supportive climate for creativity within the organization acting as a role model for innovative thinking providing employees with rewards and recognition for innovative thinking hiring and team composition i e putting together teams with specific skill sets needed for innovative thinking or hiring employees with creative personalities without planning what they work on Proposed Model for Innovation Leadership edit A proposed model for innovation leadership has been a multilevel process model of innovation   which uses the direct and indirect leadership on the processes of innovation mentioned in the above section to promote the innovation process In the model indirect leadership influences affect the individual creativity generation phase and team creativity evaluation phase process Direct leadership influences affect the team creativity evaluation phase process and the organizational innovation process implementation phase The individual creativity generation phase box in the model represents the process of the individual generating the initial idea or ideas and proposing them to their team The team creativity evaluation phase box represents the process of the team taking that idea making alterations and fine-tuning it to the point of making prototypes formalized sketches or simulations The organizational innovation implementation box represents taking those prototypes sketches or simulations and testing evaluating and possibly mass-producing them Figure   Model of direct and indirect leadership influences on the process of innovation   Two very important key features of this model should be mentioned The three stages of innovation idea generation evaluation and implementation are not independent of one another The stages in the model should not be viewed in a lock-step fashion meaning that there are both backward and forward influences and activities affecting each of the three stages For example ideas are generated discussed and tested only to feed information back into the system starting the process from the beginning again   The forward and backward arrows between individual creativity and team creativity the forward and backward arrows between team creativity and organizational innovation as well as the arrow from organizational innovation to individual creativity visually represent this key feature Paradoxes of Innovation Leadership edit Innovation leadership is complex as can be seen from the Hunter & Cushenbery   model   and often paradoxes emerge that require leaders to strike a delicate balance between two conflicting roles e g encouraging innovative ideas vs limiting innovative ideas to include only those that are most viable and useful to the organization A balance must be struck not only within the leader and their behaviors but between conflicting interests of involved parties as well These include conflicting interests between the leader and the employees/teams between leaders and situational/contextual factors and between the employees/teams and the organization Critical potential paradoxes that are often faced by leaders of innovation have been provided by Hunter Thoroughgood Meyer & Ligon     Internal/Localized Paradox edit Internal/Localized paradoxes entail conflicting roles experienced within the leader Dual Expertise Paradox edit The Dual Expertise Paradox postulates that a leader must have or acquire domain expertise while at the same time obtaining the necessary leadership skills to manage his/her employees and resources Generation Evaluation Paradox edit The Generation Evaluation Paradox stipulates that a leader must encourage a supportive climate for the generation of new ideas and thinking outside-the-box while evaluating these ideas and realizing that not all creative ideas are useful and many may even fail while not being too critical and negative of those ideas Team-level Paradox edit Team-level paradoxes entail conflicting interests between the leader and the employees/teams Creative Personality Cohesion Paradox edit Creative Personality Cohesion Paradox is based on the research finding that creative workers generally highly value autonomy     and as a result often prefer to work alone This paradox illustrates the difficulty leaders have in providing their employees with the autonomy they must be creative while fostering team cohesion or closeness to facilitate idea sharing A leader must also be careful not to encourage too much cohesion as it may discourage group members from disagreeing even constructively disagreeing with fellow group members in an effort not to offend them or rock the boat Vision Autonomy Paradox edit The Vision Autonomy Paradox highlights the dilemma a leader faces between providing structure and guidance to a team with respect to the vision of the goal while at the same time stepping back and providing the team with enough autonomy especially considering the fact that creative workers highly value autonomy When leading for innovation providing an overabundance of structure may result in a backlash from employees who feel their autonomy is being taken away from them Restriction Freedom Paradox edit The Restriction Freedom Paradox underscores that innovation leaders need to allow employees enough time to develop creative endeavors and provide the resources to do so At the same time the leader must take care to provide enough pressure that they are still motivated to complete the task     and not provide too many resources that it has a deadening effect on creativity   Situational Paradox edit Situational Paradoxes entail conflicting interests between leaders and the situations they face Intrinsic Extrinsic Paradox edit The Intrinsic Extrinsic Paradox holds that instead of providing more readily available extrinsic motivation tools such as bonuses and salary increases leaders must provide intrinsic motivation which generally comes from within the employee to their employees This paradox is based on findings that intrinsic motivation is a key factor in facilitating creativity     and extrinsic motivators may either hinder creativity     or have an unclear relationship with creativity     Local Long-Term Paradox edit The Local Long-Term Paradox posits that leaders of innovation must maintain their innovative edge by keeping an eye out for and capitalizing on potential opportunities even at the risk of placing those ideas above or even eliminating ideas that he or she had previously inspired in their teams The leader must also be capable of developing teams that are flexible enough to be passionate about ideas that may have replaced their own idea that was facilitated inspired and supported by their leader This is where the paradox is most clearly visible   Competition Collaboration Paradox edit The competition collaboration paradox involves a leader developing open external relationships with other organizations to discover potential innovation opportunities while ensuring the organization s emerging ideas are protected in a competitive environment Feedback Rigidity Paradox edit The feedback rigidity paradox involves leaders seeking out and using customer and client advice and feedback towards innovative endeavors to a certain extent while maintaining control of the vision and not letting the feedback dictate to them as clients and customers often criticize innovations early on Failure Success Paradox edit The Failure Success Paradox is the idea that innovation leaders must ensure a safe organizational culture that is willing to embrace risk and failure while at the same time making sure that the organization is also producing successful products and services despite embracing risk and errors Additional Paradoxes edit Additional paradoxes identified by Hunter et al   that do not directly involve the leader but are worth mentioning are the paradoxes that occur between teams and the organization These include the Insularity Cohesion paradox the Champion Evaluator paradox and the Creativity Cost paradox   Outcomes edit Outcomes of innovation leadership include inspiring employees to the create and implement novel ideas for products services and technologies In addition these novel ideas can also be used to solve problems within an organization What this illustrates is that innovation spurred by innovation leadership can be translated across various industries and can be used for a multitude of purposes         Ultimately inspiring and initiating organizational innovation through innovation leadership can serve to advance the organization it to the next level   Real-World Examples of Innovation Leadership edit Companies that use innovative leadership include 3M which lets employees work on a project of their choosing for 15% of their time   Similarly Google allows employees one day a week to work on their own project   Zappos employees are allowed to radically decorate their cubicle and are encouraged to laugh and have fun at work impromptu in-office parades     edit Innovation Leadership Leadership studies Organization development"},

different aspects of this societal development The British polymath crystallographer J D Bernal introduced the term \" scientific and technical revolution \" in his   book The Social Function of Science to describe the new role that science and technology are coming to play within society He asserted that science is becoming a \"productive force\" using the Marxist Theory of Productive Forces   After some controversy the term was taken up by authors and institutions of the then- Soviet Bloc Their aim was to show that socialism was a safe home for the scientific and technical

this topic   Daniel Bell   challenged this theory and advocated post-industrial society which would lead to a service economy rather than socialism   Many other authors presented their views including Zbigniew Brzezinski   with his \"Technetronic Society\"   Contents   Information in social and economic activities   The theory of information revolution   Measuring and modeling the information revolution       References   Bibliography     Information in social and economic activities edit The main feature of the information revolution is the growing economic social and technological role of information Information-related activities did not come up with the Information Revolution They existed in one form or the other in all human societies and eventually developed into institutions such as the Platonic Academy Aristotle 's Peripatetic school in the Lyceum the Musaeum and the Library of Alexandria or the schools of Babylonian astronomy The Agricultural Revolution and the Industrial Revolution came up when new informational inputs were produced by individual innovators or by scientific and technical institutions During the Information Revolution all these activities are experiencing continuous growth while other information-oriented activities are emerging Information is the central theme of several new sciences which emerged in the 1940s including Shannon 's   Information Theory   and Wiener 's   Cybernetics Wiener stated \"information is information not matter or energy\" This aphorism suggests that information should be considered along with matter and energy as the third constituent part of the Universe information is carried by matter or by energy   By the 1990s some writers believed that changes implied by the Information revolution will lead to not only a fiscal crisis for governments but also the disintegration of all \"large structures\"   The theory of information revolution edit The term information revolution may relate to or contrast with such widely used terms as Industrial Revolution and Agricultural Revolution Note however that you may prefer mentalist to materialist paradigm The following fundamental aspects of the theory of information revolution can be given     The object of economic activities can be conceptualized according to the fundamental distinction between matter energy and information These apply both to the object of each economic activity as well as within each economic activity or enterprise For instance an industry may process matter e g iron using energy and information production and process technologies management etc Information is a factor of production along with capital labor land economics as well as a product sold in the market that is a commodity As such it acquires use value and exchange value and therefore a price All products have use value exchange value and informational value The latter can be measured by the information content of the product in terms of innovation design etc Industries develop information-generating activities the so-called Research and Development R&D functions Enterprises and society at large develop the information control and processing functions in the form of management structures these are also called \" white-collar workers \" \" bureaucracy \" \"managerial functions\" etc Labor can be classified according to the object of labor into information labor and non-information labor Information activities constitute a large new economic sector the information sector along with the traditional primary sector secondary sector and tertiary sector according to the three-sector hypothesis These should be restated because they are based on the ambiguous definitions made by Colin Clark   who included in the tertiary sector all activities that have not been included in the primary agriculture forestry etc and secondary manufacturing sectors   The quaternary sector and the quinary sector of the economy attempt to classify these new activities but their definitions are not based on a clear conceptual scheme although the latter is considered by some as equivalent with the information sector   From a strategic point of view sectors can be defined as information sector means of production means of consumption thus extending the classical Ricardo - Marx model of the Capitalist mode of production see Influences on Karl Marx Marx stressed in many occasions the role of the \"intellectual element\" in production but failed to find a place for it into his model     Innovations are the result of the production of new information as new products new methods of production patents etc Diffusion of innovations manifests saturation effects related term market saturation following certain cyclical patterns and creating \"economic waves\" also referred to as \" business cycles \" There are various types of waves such as Kondratiev wave   years Kuznets swing   years Juglar cycle   years and Kitchin about   years see

information sector in the economic reports of its member countries   Veneris     explored the theoretical economic and regional aspects of the informational revolution and developed a systems dynamics

States\" claimed that the \"knowledge industry represented 29% of the US gross national product\" which he saw as evidence that the Information Age had begun He defines knowledge as a commodity and attempts to measure the magnitude of the production and distribution of this commodity within a modern economy Machlup divided information use into three classes instrumental intellectual and pastime knowledge He identified also five types of knowledge practical knowledge intellectual knowledge that is general culture and the satisfying of intellectual curiosity pastime knowledge that is knowledge

For other uses see Paradigm Shift disambiguation A paradigm shift also radical theory change   a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher Thomas Kuhn     is a fundamental change in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline Kuhn contrasted these shifts which characterize a scientific revolution to the activity of normal science which he described as scientific work done within a prevailing framework or paradigm In this context the word \"paradigm\" is used in its original Greek meaning as \"example\" The nature of scientific revolutions has been studied by modern philosophy since Immanuel Kant used the phrase in the preface to his Critique of Pure Reason   He referred to Greek mathematics and Newtonian physics In the 20th century new developments in the basic concepts of mathematics physics and biology revitalized interest in the question among scholars It was against this active background that Kuhn published his work Kuhn presented his notion of a paradigm shift in his influential book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions   As one commentator summarizes Kuhn acknowledges having used the term \"paradigm\" in two different meanings In the first one \"paradigm\" designates what the members of a certain scientific community have in common that is to say the whole of techniques patents and values shared by the members of the community In the second sense the paradigm is a single element of a whole say for instance Newton s Principia which acting as a common model or an example stands for the explicit rules and thus defines a coherent tradition of investigation Thus the question is for Kuhn to investigate by means of the paradigm what makes possible the constitution of what he calls \"normal science\" That is to say the science which can decide if a certain problem will be considered scientific or not Normal science does not mean at all a science guided by a coherent system of rules on the contrary the rules can be derived from the paradigms but the paradigms can guide the investigation also in the absence of rules This is precisely the second meaning of the term \"paradigm\" which Kuhn considered the most new and profound though it is in truth the oldest   Since the 1960s the concept of a paradigm shift has also been used in numerous non-scientific contexts to describe a profound change in a fundamental model or perception of events even though Kuhn himself restricted the use of the term to the physical sciences Contents   Kuhnian paradigm shifts   Science and paradigm shift   Examples of paradigm shifts     Natural sciences     Social sciences     Applied sciences   Marketing   Other uses       References     Citations     Sources     Kuhnian paradigm shifts edit Kuhn used the duck-rabbit optical illusion made famous by Wittgenstein to demonstrate the way in which a paradigm shift could cause one to see the same information in an entirely different way   An epistemological paradigm shift was called a \"scientific revolution\" by epistemologist and historian of science Thomas Kuhn in his book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions A scientific revolution occurs according to Kuhn when scientists encounter anomalies that cannot be explained by the universally accepted paradigm within which scientific progress has thereto been made The paradigm in Kuhn's view is not simply the current theory but the entire worldview in which it exists and all of the implications which come with it This is based on features of landscape of knowledge that scientists can identify around them There are anomalies for all paradigms Kuhn maintained that are brushed away as acceptable levels of error or simply ignored and not dealt with a principal argument Kuhn uses to reject Karl Popper 's model of falsifiability as the key force involved in scientific change Rather according to Kuhn anomalies have various levels of significance to the practitioners of science at the time To put it in the context of early 20th century physics some scientists found the problems with calculating Mercury's perihelion more troubling than the Michelson-Morley experiment results and some the other way around Kuhn's model of scientific change differs here and in many places from that of the logical positivists in that it puts an enhanced emphasis on the individual humans involved as scientists rather than abstracting science into a purely logical or philosophical venture When enough significant anomalies have accrued against a current paradigm the scientific discipline is thrown into a state of crisis according to Kuhn During this crisis new ideas perhaps ones previously discarded are tried Eventually a new paradigm is formed which gains its own new followers and an intellectual \"battle\" takes place between the followers of the new paradigm and the hold-outs of the old paradigm Again for early 20th century physics the transition between the Maxwellian electromagnetic worldview and the Einsteinian relativistic worldview was neither instantaneous nor calm and instead involved a protracted set of \"attacks \" both with empirical data as well as rhetorical or philosophical arguments by both sides with the Einsteinian theory winning out in the long run Again the weighing of evidence and importance of new data was fit through the human sieve some scientists found the simplicity of Einstein's equations to be most compelling while some found them more complicated than the notion of Maxwell's aether which they banished Some found Arthur Eddington 's photographs of light bending around the sun to be compelling while some questioned their accuracy and meaning Sometimes the convincing force is just time itself and the human toll it takes Kuhn said using a quote from Max Planck \"a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it \"   After a given discipline has changed from one paradigm to another this is called in Kuhn's terminology a scientific revolution or a paradigm shift It is often this final conclusion the result of the long process that is meant when the term paradigm shift is used colloquially simply the often radical change of worldview without reference to the specificities of Kuhn's historical argument In a   retrospective on Kuhn   the philosopher Martin Cohen describes the notion of the \"Paradigm Shift\" as a kind of intellectual virus spreading from hard science to social science and on to the arts and even everyday political rhetoric today Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what it might mean and in line with the American philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive Science and paradigm shift edit A common misinterpretation of paradigms is the belief that the discovery of paradigm shifts and the dynamic nature of science with its many opportunities for subjective judgments by scientists are a case for relativism   the view that all kinds of belief systems are equal Kuhn vehemently denies this interpretation   and states that when a scientific paradigm is replaced by a new one albeit through a complex social process the new one is always better not just different These claims of relativism are however tied to another claim that Kuhn does at least somewhat endorse that the language and theories of different paradigms cannot be translated into one another or rationally evaluated against one another that they are incommensurable This gave rise to much talk of different peoples and cultures having radically different worldviews or conceptual schemes so different that whether or not one was better they could not be understood by one another However the philosopher Donald Davidson published a highly regarded essay in   \" On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme \" Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association Vol       pp     arguing that the notion that any languages or theories could be incommensurable with one another was itself incoherent If this is correct Kuhn's claims must be taken in a weaker sense than they often are Furthermore the hold of the Kuhnian analysis on social science has long been tenuous with the wide application of multi-paradigmatic approaches in order to understand complex human behaviour see for example John Hassard Sociology and Organization Theory Positivism Paradigm and Postmodernity Cambridge University Press   ISBN   Paradigm shifts tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature as in physics at the end of the 19th century At that time physics seemed to be a discipline filling in the last few details of a largely worked-out system In   Lord Kelvin famously told an assemblage of physicists at the British Association for the Advancement of Science \"There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now All that remains is more and more precise measurement \"   veracity of this quote challenged in Lord Kelvin article Five years later Albert Einstein published his paper on special relativity which challenged the very simple set of rules laid down by Newtonian mechanics which had been used to describe force and motion for over two hundred years In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions Kuhn wrote \"Successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science \" p   Kuhn's idea was itself revolutionary in its time as it caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science Thus it could be argued that it caused or was itself part of a \"paradigm shift\" in the history and sociology of science However Kuhn would not recognise such a paradigm shift In the social sciences people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science Philosophers and historians of science including Kuhn himself ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn's model which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it citation needed Examples of paradigm shifts edit Natural sciences edit Some of the \"classical cases\" of Kuhnian paradigm shifts in science are   The transition in cosmology from a Ptolemaic cosmology to a Copernican one     The acceptance of the work of Andreas Vesalius whose work De humani corporis fabrica corrected the numerous errors in the previously-held system created by Galen     The transition in mechanics from Aristotelian mechanics to classical mechanics     The acceptance of Lavoisier 's theory of chemical reactions and combustion in place of phlogiston theory known as the chemical revolution     The transition in optics from geometrical optics to physical optics with Augustin-Jean Fresnel 's wave theory     The discovery of hyperbolic geometry     The revolution in evolution from goal-directed change to Charles Darwin 's natural selection     - The germ theory of disease began overtaking Galen's miasma theory   The development of quantum mechanics which replaced classical mechanics at microscopic scales     The transition from the luminiferous aether present in space to electromagnetic radiation in spacetime     The transition between the worldview of Newtonian gravity and the Einsteinian General Relativity Social sciences edit In Kuhn's view the existence of a single reigning paradigm is characteristic of the natural sciences while philosophy and much of social science were characterized by a \"tradition of claims counterclaims and debates over fundamentals \"   Others have applied Kuhn's concept of paradigm shift to the social sciences The movement known as the cognitive revolution moved away from behaviourist approaches to psychological study and the acceptance of cognition as central to studying human behaviour The Keynesian revolution is typically viewed as a major shift in macroeconomics   According to John Kenneth Galbraith Say's Law dominated economic thought prior to Keynes for over a century and the shift to Keynesianism was difficult Economists who contradicted the law which implied that underemployment and underinvestment coupled with oversaving were virtually impossible risked losing their careers   In his magnum opus Keynes cited one of his predecessors John A Hobson   who was repeatedly denied positions at universities for his heretical theory Later the movement for monetarism over Keynesianism marked a second divisive shift Monetarists held that fiscal policy was not effective for stabilizing inflation that it was solely a monetary phenomenon in contrast to the Keynesian view of the time was that both fiscal and monetary policy were important Keynesians later adopted much of the monetarists' view of the quantity theory of money and shifting Phillips curve theories they initially rejected   First proposed by Ferdinand de Saussure in   the laryngeal theory in Indo-European linguistics postulated the existence of \"laryngeal\" consonants in the Proto-Indo-European language PIE a theory that was confirmed by the discovery of the Hittite language in the early 20th century The theory has since been accepted by the vast majority of linguists paving the way for the internal reconstruction of the syntax and grammatical rules of PIE and is considered one of the most significant developments in linguistics since the initial discovery of the Indo-European language family   Applied sciences edit More recently paradigm shifts are also recognisable in applied sciences In medicine the transition from \"clinical judgment\" to evidence-based medicine In software engineering the transition from the Rational Paradigm to the Empirical Paradigm   Marketing edit In the later part of the 1990s 'paradigm shift' emerged as a buzzword popularized as marketing speak and appearing more frequently in print and publication   In his book Mind The Gaffe author Larry Trask advises readers to refrain from using it and to use caution when reading anything that contains the phrase It is referred to in several articles and books     as abused and overused to the point of becoming meaningless Other uses edit The term \"paradigm shift\" has found uses in other contexts representing the notion of a major change in a certain thought-pattern a radical change in personal beliefs complex systems or organizations replacing the former way of thinking or organizing with a radically different way of thinking or organizing M L Handa a professor of sociology in education at O I S E University of Toronto Canada developed the concept of a paradigm within the context of social sciences He defines what he means by \"paradigm\" and introduces the idea of a \"social paradigm\" In addition he identifies the basic component of any social paradigm Like Kuhn he addresses the issue of changing paradigms the process popularly known as \"paradigm shift\" In this respect he focuses on the social circumstances which precipitate such a shift Relatedly he addresses how that shift affects social institutions including the institution of education citation needed The concept has been developed for technology and economics in the identification of new techno-economic paradigms as changes in technological systems that have a major influence on the behaviour of the entire economy Carlota Perez earlier work only on technological paradigms by Giovanni Dosi This concept is linked to Joseph Schumpeter 's idea of creative destruction Examples include the move to mass production and the introduction of microelectronics   Two photographs of the Earth from space \" Earthrise \"   and \" The Blue Marble \"   are thought to have helped to usher in the environmentalist movement which gained great prominence in the years immediately following distribution of those images     Hans K ng applies Thomas Kuhn's theory of paradigm change to the entire history of Christian thought and theology He identifies six historical \"macromodels\"   the apocalyptic paradigm of primitive Christianity   the Hellenistic paradigm of the patristic period   the medieval Roman Catholic paradigm   the Protestant Reformation paradigm   the modern Enlightenment paradigm and   the emerging ecumenical paradigm He also discusses five analogies between natural

intelligence CI is the action of defining gathering analyzing and distributing intelligence about products customers competitors and any aspect of the environment needed to support executives and managers in strategic decision making for an organization CI means understanding and learning what is happening in the world outside the business to increase one's competitivity It means learning as much as possible as soon as possible about one's external environment including one's industry in general and relevant competitors   Key points Competitive intelligence is a legal business practice as opposed to industrial espionage which is illegal   The focus is on the external business environment   There is a process involved in gathering information converting it into intelligence and then using it in decision making Some CI professionals erroneously emphasise that if the intelligence gathered is not usable or actionable it is not intelligence   Another definition of CI regards it as the organizational function responsible for the early identification of risks and opportunities in the market before they become obvious \"early signal analysis\" This definition focuses attention on the difference between dissemination of widely available factual information such as market statistics financial reports newspaper clippings performed by functions such as libraries and information centers and competitive intelligence which is a perspective on developments and events aimed at yielding a competitive edge   The term CI is often viewed as synonymous with competitor analysis but

This has since been extended most notably by the pair of Craig Fleisher and Babette Bensoussan who through several popular books on competitive analysis have added   commonly applied competitive intelligence analysis techniques to the practitioner's tool box     In   Leonard Fuld published his best selling book dedicated to competitor intelligence   However the institutionalization of CI as a formal activity among American corporations can be traced to   when Ben and Tamar Gilad published the first organizational model of a formal corporate CI function which was then adopted widely by US companies   The first professional certification program CIP was created in   with the establishment of The Fuld-Gilad-Herring Academy of Competitive Intelligence in Cambridge Massachusetts In   the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals SCIP was founded in the United States and grew in the late 1990s to around     members worldwide mainly in the United States and Canada but with large numbers especially in the UK and Australia Due to financial difficulties in   the organization merged with Frost & Sullivan under the Frost & Sullivan Institute SCIP has since been renamed \"Strategic & Competitive Intelligence Professionals\" to emphasise the strategic nature of the subject and also to refocus the organisation's general approach while keeping the existing SCIP brandname and logo A number of efforts have been made to discuss the field's advances in post-secondary university education covered by several authors including Blenkhorn & Fleisher   Fleisher   Fuld   Prescott   and McGonagle   Although the general view would be that competitive intelligence concepts can be readily found and taught in many business schools around the globe there are still relatively few dedicated academic programs majors or degrees in the field a concern to academics in the field who would like to see it further researched   These issues were widely discussed by over a dozen knowledgeable individuals in a special edition of the Competitive Intelligence Magazine that was dedicated to this topic   In France a Specialized Master in Economic Intelligence and Knowledge Management was created in   within the CERAM Business School now SKEMA Business School in Paris with the objective of delivering a full and professional training in Economic Intelligence A Centre for Global Intelligence and Influence was created in September   in the same School On the other hand practitioners and companies regard professional accreditation as especially important in this field   In   SCIP recognized the Fuld-Gilad-Herring Academy of Competitive Intelligence 's CIP certification process as its global dual-level CIP-I and CIP-II certification program Global developments have also been uneven in competitive intelligence   Several academic journals particularly the Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management in its third volume provided coverage of the field's global development   For example in   the cole de guerre conomique fr School of economic warfare was founded in Paris France It is the first European institution which teaches the tactics of economic warfare within a globalizing world In Germany competitive intelligence was unattended until the early 1990s The term \"competitive intelligence\" first appeared in German literature in   In   a German SCIP chapter was founded which is now second in terms of membership in Europe In summer   the Institute for Competitive Intelligence was founded which provides a postgraduate certification program for Competitive Intelligence Professionals Japan is currently the only country that officially maintains an economic intelligence agency JETRO It was founded by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry MITI in   Accepting the importance of competitive intelligence major multinational corporations such as ExxonMobil Procter & Gamble and Johnson and Johnson have created formal CI units citation needed Importantly organizations execute competitive intelligence activities not only as a safeguard to protect against market threats and changes but also as a method for finding new opportunities and trends   Organizations use competitive intelligence to compare themselves to other organizations \"competitive benchmarking\" to identify risks and opportunities in their markets and to pressure-test their plans against market response business wargaming   which enable them to make informed decisions Most firms today realize the importance of knowing what their competitors are doing and how the industry is changing and the information gathered allows organizations to understand their strengths and weaknesses One of the major activities involved in corporate competitive intelligence is use of ratio analysis using key performance indicators KPI Organizations compare annual reports of their competitors on certain KPI and ratios which are intrinsic to their industry This helps them track their performance vis-a-vis their competitors   The actual importance of these categories of information to an organization depends on the contestability of its markets the organizational culture the personality and biases of its top decision makers and the reporting structure of competitive intelligence within the company Strategic Intelligence SI focuses on the longer term looking at issues affecting a company's competitiveness over the course of a couple of years The actual time horizon for SI ultimately depends on the industry and how quickly it's changing The general questions that SI answers are Where should we as a company be in X years?' and 'What are the strategic risks and opportunities facing us?' This type of intelligence work involves among others the identification of weak signals and application of methodology and process called Strategic Early Warning SEW first introduced by Gilad       followed by Steven Shaker and Victor Richardson   Alessandro Comai and Joaquin Tena     and others According to Gilad 20% of the work of competitive intelligence practitioners should be dedicated to strategic early identification of weak signals within a SEW framework Tactical Intelligence the focus is on providing information designed to improve shorter-term decisions most often related with the intent of growing market share or revenues Generally it is the type of information that you would need to support the sales process in an organization It investigates various aspects of a product/product line marketing   Product what are people selling? Price what price are they charging? Promotion what activities are they conducting for promoting this product? Place where are they selling this product? Other sales force structure clinical trial design technical issues etc With the right amount of information organizations can avoid unpleasant surprises by anticipating competitors' moves and decreasing response time Examples of competitive intelligence research is evident in daily newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal Business Week and Fortune Major airlines change hundreds of fares daily in response to competitors' tactics They use information to plan their own marketing pricing and production strategies Resources such as the Internet have made gathering information on competitors easy With a click of a button analysts can discover future trends and market requirements However competitive intelligence is much more than this as the ultimate aim is to lead to competitive advantage As the Internet is mostly public domain material information gathered is less likely to result in insights that will be unique to the company In fact there is a risk that information gathered from the Internet will be misinformation and mislead users so competitive intelligence researchers are often wary of using such information As a result although the Internet is viewed as a key source most CI professionals should spend their time and budget gathering intelligence using primary research networking with industry experts from trade shows and conferences from their own customers and suppliers and so on Where the Internet is used it is to gather sources for primary research as well as information on what the company says about itself and its online presence in the form of links to other companies its strategy regarding search engines and online advertising mentions in discussion forums and on blogs etc Also important are online subscription databases and news aggregation sources which have simplified the secondary source collection process Social media sources are also becoming important providing potential interviewee names as well as opinions and attitudes and sometimes breaking news e g via Twitter Organizations must be careful not to spend too much time and effort on old competitors without realizing the existence of any new competitors Knowing more about your competitors will allow your business to grow and succeed The practice of competitive intelligence is growing every year and most companies and business students now realize the importance of knowing their competitors According to Arjan Singh and Andrew Beurschgens in their   article in the Competitive Intelligence Review there are four stages of development of a competitive intelligence capability with a firm It starts with \"stick fetching\" where a CI department is very reactive up to \"world class\" where it is completely integrated in the decision-making process

websites now permit real-time counterintelligence as a strategy for horizontal and vertical market expansion and product positioning This occurs in an automated fashion on massive marketplaces such as Amazon com and their classification and prediction of product associations and purchase probability Similar fields edit Competitive intelligence has been influenced by national strategic intelligence Although national intelligence was researched   years ago competitive intelligence was introduced during the 1990s Competitive-intelligence professionals can learn from national-intelligence experts especially in the analysis of complex situations   Competitive intelligence may be confused with or seen to overlap environmental scanning business intelligence and market research   Craig Fleisher   questions the appropriateness of the term comparing it to business intelligence competitor intelligence knowledge management market intelligence marketing research and strategic intelligence   Fleisher   verification needed suggests that business intelligence has two forms Its narrow contemporary form is more focused on information technology and internal focus than CI while its broader historical definition is more inclusive than CI Knowledge management KM when improperly achieved is seen as an information-technology driven organizational practice relying on data mining corporate intranets and mapping organizational assets to make it accessible to organization members for decision-making CI shares some aspects of KM they are human-intelligence- and experience-based for a more-sophisticated qualitative analysis km is essential for effective change A key effective factor is a powerful dedicated IT system executing the full intelligence cycle   Market intelligence MI is industry-targeted intelligence developed in real-time aspects of competitive events taking place among the four Ps of the marketing mix pricing place promotion and product in the product or service marketplace to better understand the market's attractiveness   A time-based competitive tactic MI is used by marketing and sales managers to respond to consumers more quickly in the marketplace Fleisher suggests it is not distributed as widely as some forms of CI which are also distributed to non-marketing decision-makers   verification needed Market intelligence has a shorter time horizon than other intelligence areas and is measured in days weeks or in slower-moving industries months Market research is a tactical method-driven field consisting of neutral primary research of customer data beliefs and perceptions gathered in surveys or focus groups and is analyzed with statistical-research techniques   CI draws on a wider variety primary and secondary of sources from a wider range of stakeholders suppliers competitors distributors substitutes and media to answer existing questions raise new ones and guide action   verification needed Ben Gilad and Jan Herring lay down a set of prerequisites defining CI distinguishing it from other information-rich disciplines such as market research or business development They show that a common body of knowledge and a unique set of tools key intelligence topics business war games and blindspots analysis distinguish CI while other sensory activities in a commercial firm focus on one segment of the market customers suppliers or acquisition targets CI synthesizes data from all high-impact players HIP   Gilad later focused his delineation of CI on the difference between information and intelligence According to him the common denominator among organizational sensory functions whether they are called market research business intelligence or market intelligence is that they deliver information rather than intelligence Intelligence says Gilad is a perspective on facts rather than the facts themselves Unique among corporate functions competitive intelligence has a perspective of risks and opportunities for a firm's performance as such it not information activities is part of an organization's risk-management activity   Ethics edit Ethics has been a long-held issue of discussion among CI practitioners   The questions revolve around what is and is not allowable in terms of CI activity A number of scholarly treatments have been generated on this topic most prominently addressed through Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals publications   The book Competitive Intelligence Ethics Navigating the Gray Zone provides nearly twenty separate views about ethics in CI as well as another   codes used by various individuals or organizations   Combining that with the over two dozen scholarly articles or studies found within the various CI bibliographic entries   verification needed       it is clear that no shortage of study has gone into better classifying understanding and addressing CI ethics Competitive information may be obtained from public or subscription sources from networking with competitor staff or customers disassembly of competitor products or from field research interviews Competitive intelligence research is distinguishable from industrial espionage as CI

small-scale workshop offering personal digital fabrication     A fab lab is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials with the aim to make \"almost anything\"   This includes technology -enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production While fab labs have yet to compete with mass production and its associated economies of scale in fabricating widely distributed products they have already shown the potential to empower individuals to create smart devices for themselves   These

community can be powered by technology at the grassroots level   The program began as a collaboration between the Grassroots Invention Group and the Center for Bits and Atoms at the Media Lab in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a grant from the National Science Foundation Washington D C in     Vigyan Ashram in India was the first fab lab to be set up outside MIT It is established in   and received capital equipment by NSF-USA and IITK While the Grassroots Invention Group is no longer in the Media Lab The Center for Bits and Atoms consortium is still actively involved in continuing research in areas related to description and fabrication but does not operate or maintain any of the labs worldwide with the excmobile fab lab The fab lab concept also grew out of a popular class at MIT MAS   named \"How To Make Almost Anything\" The class is still offered in the fall semesters Popular equipment and projects edit Flexible manufacturing equipment within a fab lab can include Mainly a rapid prototyper typically a 3D printer of plastic or plaster parts 3-axis CNC machines   or more axes computer-controlled subtractive milling or turning machines Printed circuit board milling or etching two-dimensional high precision milling to create circuit traces in pre-clad copper boards   Microprocessor and digital electronics design assembly and test stations Cutters

project started in England in   as a University of Bath initiative to develop a low-cost 3D printer that can print most of its own components but it is now made up of hundreds of collaborators world wide   RepRap is short for replicating rapid prototyper As an open design all of the designs produced by the project are released under a free software license the GNU General Public License   Due to the ability of the machine to make some of its own parts authors envisioned the possibility of cheap RepRap units enabling the manufacture of complex products without the need for extensive industrial infrastructure       They intended for the RepRap to demonstrate evolution in this process as well as for it to increase in number exponentially     A preliminary study claimed that using RepRaps to print common products results in economic savings   Contents   History   Hardware     Designs   Software   Replication materials   Construction   Project members   Goals   Education applications       Notes   References     History edit RepRap     building an object First part ever made by a RepRap to make a RepRap fabricated by the Zaphod prototype by Vik Olliver 2006/09/13 RepRap was founded in   by Dr Adrian Bowyer a Senior Lecturer in mechanical engineering at the University of Bath in England Funding was obtained from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council On   September   the RepRap     prototype successfully printed the first part of itself which were subsequently used to replace an identical part originally created by a commercial 3D printer On   February   RepRap     \"Darwin\" successfully made at least one instance of over half its total rapid-prototyped parts On   April   possibly the first end-user item is made by a RepRap a clamp to hold an iPod securely to the dashboard of a Ford Fiesta By September of that year it was reported that at least   copies have been produced in various countries   In April   electronic circuit boards were produced automatically with a RepRap using an automated control system and a swappable head system capable of printing both plastic and conductive solder On   October   the second generation design called \"Mendel\" printed its first part The Mendel's shape resembles a triangular prism rather than a cube RepRap     \"Mendel\" was completed in October   On   January   the Foresight Institute announced the \"Kartik M Gada Humanitarian Innovation Prize\" for the design and construction of an improved RepRap   The third generation design \"Huxley\" was officially named on   August   Development is based on a miniaturized version of the Mendel hardware with 30% of the original print volume Within two years RepRap and RepStrap building and usage were widespread within the tech gadget and engineering communities   In   the first successful Delta design Rostock had a radically different design The latest iterations used OpenBeams wires typically Dyneema or Spectra fishing lines instead of belts and so forth which also represented some of the latest trends in RepRaps citation needed In early January   RepRapPro short for \"RepRap Professional\" and one commercial arm of the RepRap project in the UK announced that they are to cease trading on   January   The reason given was congestion of the market for low-cost 3D printers and the inability to expand in that market RepRapPro China continues to operate   Hardware edit As the project was designed by Dr Bowyer to encourage evolution many variations have been created     As an open source project designers are free to make modifications and substitutions but they must reshare their improvements Designs edit There are many RepRap printer designs including Prusa i3 Hangprinter RepRap Fisher RepRap Snappy RepRap Morgan RepRap Ormerod RepRap Darwin RepRap Mendel Software edit Play media Adrian Bowyer talking about the RepRap Project at Poptech   RepRap has been conceived as a complete replication system rather than simply a piece of hardware To this end the system includes computer-aided design CAD in the form of a 3D modeling system and computer-aided manufacturing CAM software and drivers that convert RepRap users' designs into a set of instructions to the RepRap hardware that turns them into physical objects Initially two different CAM toolchains had been developed for the RepRap The first simply titled \"RepRap Host\" was written in Java by lead RepRap developer Adrian Bowyer The second \" Skeinforge \" was written independently by Enrique Perez Both are complete systems for translating 3D computer models into G-code the machine language that commands the printer Later other programs like slic3r pronterface   Cura   were created Recently Franklin firmware   was created to allow RepRap 3-D printers to be used as general purposes 3-D robots in addition to 3-D printing e g milling fluid handling etc   The closed source KISSlicer   and repetier host   are also used Free and open-source 3-D modeling programs like Blender OpenSCAD and FreeCAD are preferred 3-D modeling programs in general for the RepRap community but virtually any CAD or 3D modeling program can be used with the RepRap as long as it is capable of producing STL files slic3r also supports obj and amf files Thus content creators make use of any tools they are familiar with whether they are commercial CAD programs such as SolidWorks and Autodesk AutoCAD Autodesk Inventor Autodesk 123D Design Tinkercad or SketchUp along with the libre software Replication materials edit Play media A timelapse video of a robot model logo of Make magazine being printed using FDM on a RepRap Fisher a delta-style printer RepRaps print objects from ABS Polylactic acid PLA Nylon possibly not all extruders capable HDPE TPE and similar thermoplastics Polylactic acid PLA has the engineering advantages of high stiffness minimal warping and an attractive translucent colour It is also biodegradable and plant-derived The mechanical properties of RepRap printed PLA and ABS have been tested and have been shown to be equivalent to the tensile strengths of proprietary printers   Unlike in most commercial machines RepRap users are encouraged to experiment with printing new materials and methods and to publish their results Methods for printing novel materials such as ceramics have been developed this way In addition several RecycleBots have been designed and fabricated to convert waste plastic such as shampoo containers and milk jugs into inexpensive RepRap filament   There is some evidence that using this approach of distributed recycling is better for the environment       and can be useful for creating \" fair trade filament\"   In addition 3D printing products themselves at the point of consumption by the consumer has also been shown to be better for the environment   The RepRap project has identified polyvinyl alcohol PVA as a potentially suitable support material to complement its printing process although massive overhangs can be made with using thin layers of the primary printing media as support which are mechanically removed afterwards Printing electronics is a major goal of the RepRap project so that it can print its own circuit boards Several methods have been proposed Wood's metal or Field's metal low-melting point metal alloys to incorporate electrical circuits into the part as it is being formed Silver/carbon-filled polymers commonly used for repairs to circuit boards and are being contemplated for use for electrically conductive traces   Direct extrusion of solder   Conductive wires can be laid into a part from a spool during the printing process Using a MIG welder as a print head a RepRap deltabot stage can be used to print metals like steel     The RepRap concept can also be applied to a milling machine   and to laser welding     Construction edit Although the aim of the project is for RepRap to be able to autonomously construct many of its own mechanical components in the near future using fairly low-level resources several components such as sensors stepper motors or microcontrollers are currently non-replicable using the RepRap's 3D printing technology and therefore have to be produced independently of the RepRap self-replicating process The goal is to asymptotically approach 100% replication over a series of evolutionary generations As one example from the onset of the project the RepRap team has explored a variety of approaches to integrating electrically-conductive media into the product The future success of this initiative should open the door to the inclusion of connective wiring printed circuit boards and possibly even motors in RepRapped products Variations in the nature of the extruded electrically-conductive media could produce electrical components with different functions from pure conductive traces not unlike what was done in the sprayed-circuit process of the 1940s named Electronic Circuit Making Equipment ECME described in the article on its designer John Sargrove Printed electronics is a related approach Another non-replicable component is the threaded rods for the linear motions A current research area is in using replicated Sarrus linkages to replace them   Project members edit The \"Core team\" of the project   has included Dr Adrian Bowyer Former Senior Lecturer Mechanical Engineering Department University of Bath Michael S Hart deceased   creator of Project Gutenberg Illinois Goals edit Play media Video of RepRap printing an object The stated goal of the RepRap project is to produce a pure self-replicating device not for its own sake but rather to put in the hands of individuals anywhere on the planet for a minimal outlay of capital a desktop manufacturing system that would enable the individual to manufacture many of the artifacts used in everyday life   From a theoretical viewpoint the project is attempting to prove the hypothesis that \" Rapid prototyping and direct writing technologies are sufficiently versatile to allow them to be used to make a von Neumann universal constructor \"   Education applications edit RepRap technology has great potential in educational applications according to some scholars       RepRaps have already been used for an educational mobile robotics platform   Some authors have claimed that RepRaps offer an unprecedented \"revolution\" in STEM education   The evidence for such claims comes from both the low cost ability for rapid prototyping in the classroom by students but also the fabrication of low-cost high-quality scientific equipment from open hardware designs forming open-source labs       edit Free software portal Electronics portal Additive manufacturing Clanking replicator 3D

February   Collaborative leadership is a management practice which is focused on the leadership skills across functional and organizational boundaries Contents   Term Exploration   Characteristics of collaborative leaders   Applications       References   Further reading Term Exploration edit The term started to appear in the mid-1990s in response to the twin trends of the growth in strategic alliances between private corporations and the formation of long term public private partnership contracts to rebuild public infrastructure citation needed Kurt Lewin was first to apply cooperative system in scientific method in   about individual nutrition in the United States   In her   Harvard Business Review article \"Collaborative Advantage\" Rosabeth Moss Kanter talks about leaders who recognize that there are critical business relationships \"that cannot be controlled by formal systems but require a dense web of interpersonal connections \"   And in a book published in that same year Chrislip and Larson looked at the attributes of great civic leaders in communities across the US and found some similar attributes \"Collaboration needs a different kind of leadership it needs leaders who can safeguard the process facilitate interaction and patiently deal with high levels of frustration\"   In   Harvard Business Review   authors Nick Lovegrove and Matthew Thomas co-founders of The InterSector Project   explore the complex relationship between the business government and social sectors as it relates to their role in addressing the most pressing challenges facing society issues like managing resource constraints controlling health care costs training the twenty-first-century workforce developing and implementing smart-grid and intelligent-urbanization technologies and stabilizing financial systems to foster sustainable economic growth Their research suggests that the future of collaborative leadership depends on the ability of leaders to engage and collaborate with the business government and social sectors see below for the distinguishing characteristics of such leaders   Hank Rubin author and founder of the Institute of Collaborative Leadership has written \"A collaboration is a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to accomplish a shared outcome \" In his book \"Collaborative Leadership Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools\" Rubin asks \"Who is a collaborative leader?\" and answers \"You are a collaborative leader once you have accepted responsibility for building - or helping to ensure the success of - a heterogeneous team to accomplish a shared purpose Your tools are   the purposeful exercise of your behavior communication and organizational resources in order to affect the perspective beliefs and behaviors of another person generally a collaborative partner to influence that person's relationship with you and your collaborative enterprise and   the structure and climate of an environment that supports the collaborative relationship \"   David Archer and Alex Cameron in their   book Collaborative Leadership How to succeed in an interconnected world identify the basic task of the collaborative leader as the delivery of results across boundaries between different organisations They say \"Getting value from difference is at the heart of the collaborative leader's task they have to learn to share control and to trust a partner to deliver even though that partner may operate very differently from themselves \"   Providing further exploration in his book Enabling Collaboration Achieving Success Through Strategic Alliances and Partnerships   LID Publishing Inc ISBN   Martin Echavarria argues that Collaborative Leadership is not only the result of individual collaborative leadership capability but group leadership In this respect he argues that individuals can support and contribute to collaboration and do so from a leadership point of view but it is at the level of the group where collaboration can be behaviorally experienced Accordingly Echavarria sites the work of Enrique Pichon-Rivi re a Swiss psychiatrist naturalized Argentine who developed the Operative Group method for working with groups Wilfred Bion an influential British psychoanalyst Kurt Lewin and others and describes the Operative Partnership Methodology for coaching teams to collaborate that in the book is also applied to Strategic Alliances   Characteristics of collaborative leaders edit There have been a number of research projects and reviews of key lessons for collaborative leaders Nick Lovegrove and Matthew Thomas writing for the Harvard Business Review   interviewed over   leaders who have demonstrated their ability to engage and collaborate across the business government and social sectors and found six distinguishing characteristics   Balanced motivations A desire to create public value no matter where they work combining their motivations to wield influence often in government have social impact often in nonprofits and generate wealth often in business Transferable skills A set of distinctive skills valued across sectors such as quantitative analytics strategic planning and stakeholder management Contextual intelligence A deep empathy of the differences within and between sectors especially those of language culture and key performance indicators Integrated networks A set of relationships across sectors to draw on when advancing their careers building top teams or convening decision-makers on a particular issue Prepared mind A willingness to pursue an unconventional career that zigzags across sectors and the financial readiness to take potential pay cuts from time to time Intellectual thread Holistic subject matter expertise on a particular intersector issue by understanding it from the perspective of each sector Madeleine Carter writing for the Center for Effective Public Policy as part of research project funded by the United States Department of Justice and State Justice Institute defines five qualities of a collaborative leader citation needed Willingness to take risks Eager listeners Passion for the cause Optimistic about the future Able to share knowledge power and credit Archer and Cameron list ten key lessons for a successful collaborative leader   Find the personal motive for collaborating Find ways of simplifying complex situations for your people Prepare for how you are going to handle conflict well in advance Recognize that there are some people or organisations you just can't partner with Have the courage to act for the long term Actively manage the tension between focusing on delivery and on building relationships Invest in strong personal relationships at all levels Inject energy passion and drive into your leadership style Have the confidence to share the credit generously Continually develop your interpersonal skills in particular empathy patience tenacity holding difficult conversations and coalition building Rod Newing writing in a Financial Times supplement special report says \"If a collaboration is to be effective each party must recognise and respect the different culture of the other\" And traditional development paths don't prepare leaders well for this \"traditional management development is based on giving potential managers a team of people and a set of resources to control and success is rewarded with more people and more resources to control By contrast collaboration requires managers to achieve success through people and resources outside their control and for this they have had no preparation\" citation needed Steven Wilson mentions in Collaborative leadership it s good to talk four major key leadership traits that all highly collaborative leaders share They Focus on authentic leadership placing the goals of the organization ahead of their own self-interest and following through on their commitments Relentlessly pursue transparent decision making clear how their decisions are made and who is accountable for the outcomes View resources as instruments of action realizing shared goals through the flexible use of shared resources Clarify the relationship between decisions rights accountability and rewards taking time to establish decision paths and a common vocabulary that everyone can comprehend for successful collaborations Chantale Mailhot Stephanie Gagnon Anne Langley and Louis-Felix Binitte did a research project to examine the qualities of distributing leadership and the effects diversity has on groups They found that \"coupling of leaders and objects helped to maintain the worldview of the different groups involved at different levels in the research project while directing them towards project objectives\"   In retrospect the differences of each individual increases innovation due to the variety of minds at work With everyone having their own qualities and prior experiences the integration between them in a leadership role contributes to the overall experience In this study the case was made that collaborative leadership has many benefits and is more practical than just one person solely having the role as the leader The best thing a collaborative leader can do is to lead by example They have to walk the talk and be seen to model the right behaviors Leaders must show a willingness take risks continually question their own ideas and reward others for their clear communication and valuable insights   Applications edit The need for collaborative leadership is being recognised in more and more areas Public Private Partnerships Global Supply Chains Civic collaboration to solve complex community problems On-line collaboration Linux Wikipedia etc Political collaboration to tackle global issues such as the credit crunch climate change and terrorism The Government- According to Heather Getha-Taylor and Ricardo S Morse as part of their article collaborative leadership has an impact on the roles of local government officials It is said that public administration is shifting to a more collaborative leadership oriented field because it helps with the set of skills necessary for the jobs   Education- According to Abdolhamid Arbabi and Vali Mehdinezhad collaborative leadership adds to cooperation which allows for adaptability and consistency It increases organizational commitment and decreases employee resistance to changes There is a significant correlation between the teachers self-efficiency and the principles style of collaborative leadership According to Gialamas Pelonis and Medeiros collaborative leadership allows for leaders to work together It allows for a better adaptability to change which in turn allows for growth and development   Health Services- According to Markle-Reid Dykeman Ploeg Stradiotto Andrews Bonomo & Stradiotto collaborative leadership in the Health area will allow for a more widespread set of skills required to help the patients An example brought up is the idea that the elderly do not receive the help they require because of the fact that the people do not know how to react in the given case They know what to do but when confronted by the situation they do not know how to act Collaborative leadership will allow for the skills necessary as well as a uniform set of actions they must follow   An Ipsos MORI research report published in   found that relationship management and collaborative leadership were the top two qualities or capabilities that Directors of organisations involved in large business partnerships would have liked to have had more access to when setting up or running a partnership     edit Business partnering Collaboration Shared leadership Situational

initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation instead of as an integrated curriculum   Maintaining a citizenry that is well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the public education agenda of the United States   The acronym has been widely used in the immigration debate regarding access to United States work visas for immigrants who are skilled in these fields This usage of the term is accredited to the State of Texas It has also become commonplace in

STEM success in high school can be greatly improved School integration can help black Hispanic and aboriginal students catch up with Asian and white students   STEM supports broadening the study of engineering within each of the other subjects and beginning engineering at younger grades even elementary school It also brings STEM education to all students rather than only the gifted programs In his   budget President Barack Obama renamed and broadened the \" Mathematics and Science Partnership MSP \" to award block grants to states for improving teacher education in those subjects   STEM education often uses new technologies such as RepRap 3D printers to encourage interest in STEM fields   In   the United States National Academies expressed their concern about the declining state of STEM education in the United States Its Committee on Science Engineering and Public Policy developed a list of   actions Their top three recommendations were to Increase America's talent pool by improving K   science and mathematics education Strengthen the skills of teachers through additional training in science mathematics and technology Enlarge the pipeline of students prepared to enter college and graduate with STEM degrees   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration also has implemented programs and curricula to advance STEM education in order to replenish the pool of scientists engineers and mathematicians who will lead space exploration in the 21st century   Individual states such as California have run pilot after-school STEM programs to learn what the most promising practices are and how to implement them to increase the chance of student success   Another state to invest in STEM education is Florida where Florida Polytechnic University Florida s first public university for engineering and technology dedicated to science technology engineering and mathematics STEM was established   Continuing STEM education has expanded to the post-secondary level through masters programs such as the University of Maryland's STEM Program   as well as the University of Cincinnati   Racial gap in STEM fields edit In the United States the National Science

percent of the U S workforce was black while only six percent of STEM workers were black   Though STEM in the U S has typically been dominated by white males there have been considerable efforts to create initiatives to make STEM a more racially and gender diverse field   American Competitiveness Initiative edit In the State of the Union Address on January     President George W Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative Bush proposed the initiative to address shortfalls in federal government support of educational development and progress at all academic levels in the STEM fields In detail the initiative called for significant increases in federal funding for advanced R&D programs including a doubling of federal funding support for advanced research in the physical sciences through DOE and an increase in U S higher education graduates within STEM disciplines The NASA Means Business competition sponsored by the Texas Space Grant Consortium furthers that goal College students compete to develop promotional plans to encourage students in middle and high school to study STEM subjects and to inspire professors in STEM fields to involve their students in outreach activities that support STEM education The National Science Foundation has numerous programs in STEM education including some for K   students such as the ITEST Program that supports The Global Challenge Award ITEST Program STEM programs have been implemented in some Arizona schools They implement higher cognitive skills for students and enable them to inquire and use techniques used by professionals in the STEM fields The STEM Academy is a national nonprofit-status organization dedicated to improving STEM literacy for all students It represents a recognized national next-generation high-impact academic model The practices strategies and programming are built upon a foundation of identified national best practices which are designed to improve under-represented minority and low-income student growth close achievement gaps decrease dropout rates increase high school graduation rates and improve teacher and principal effectiveness The STEM Academy represents a

 Scouting edit The Boy Scouts of America announced the roll out of an awards program in the spring of   to promote more interest and involvement in the STEM disciplines The NOVA and SUPERNOVA awards are available to Boy Scouts Cub Scouts and Venturers as they complete specific requirements appropriate to their program level in each of the four main STEM program areas Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics Girl Scouts of the United States of America incorporated STEM into their program with the goal that girls will see how they can change the world through scientific discoveries as well as to teach important skills they can use throughout there life   One of the ways STEM was incorporated is through leadership journeys where girls identify a problem come up with a solution a plan how to carry it out then carry out the solution and afterwards communicate what she learned from it   Another way is through badges which are more specific to the girl s personal interest in categories such as naturalist digital art science and technology innovation and financial literacy Special projects hosted by sponsors innovations partners such as NASA and other institutions who have partnered with Girl Scouts to connect girls to professionals and possible career fields in the STEM field they would not have been exposed to otherwise   Department of Defense

\"Ministry of Education and Training to Promote the deployment of science technology engineering and mathematics STEM education in general education program Pilot organize in some high schools from   to   Women edit   Women in STEM fields A major concern in many countries is not only limited numbers of girls going to school but also limited educational pathways for those that step into the classroom This includes more specifically how to address the lower participation and learning achievement of girls in science technology engineering and mathematics STEM education   Current campaigns to increase the gender balance within STEM fields include the UK's WISE   as well as mentoring programs such as the Million Women Mentors initiative connecting girls and young women with STEM mentors   and Verizon's #InspireHerMind project   The US Office of Science and Technology Policy during the Obama administration collaborated with the White House Council on Women and Girls to increase the participation of women and girls within STEM fields   along with the \"Educate to Innovate\" campaign   Women in STEM fields are often underrepresented holding less than 25% of the jobs in the U S   and 13% in the UK     In the United States studies have been conducted to explain this pattern such as mechanisms in recruitment and hiring processes   On average women in STEM fields earn 33% more than those in non-STEM professions   However women can be found as leaders in top professions around the country These include the U S Department of Defense NASA and the National Science Foundation NSF     Though women nearly comprise half of the US workforce they've held less than 25% of STEM jobs consistently over the last decade   While 12% of women in bachelor programs will get a degree in STEM each year only 3% continue to work within the STEM field   years after graduation   According to the National Science Foundation only 28% of U S scientists and engineers working in science and engineering occupations are women with   5% Asian women   6% black women and   8% Hispanic women   While nearly 60% of bachelor's degrees are awarded to graduating women each year less than 20% are in computer science   A   study   in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States showed that an implicit bias exists against hiring women for even entry-level STEM positions This study had faculty members in university biology chemistry and physics departments judge applications for a laboratory manager position These applications only differed in name i e John vs Jennifer A   study found that while girls perform better or equal to boys in two out of three countries in nearly all countries more girls were qualified to college-level clarification needed study than had enrolled Researchers found that female enrolment to STEM subjects was relatively lower in countries with a high degree of gender equality     Education of girls and women in STEM edit Gender differences in STEM education participation at the expense of girls are already visible in early childhood care and education ECCE and become more visible at higher levels of education Girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age and lower levels of participation are already seen in advanced studies at secondary level By higher education women represent only 35% of all students enrolled in STEM-related fields of study Gender differences also exist in STEM disciplines with the lowest female enrolment observed in information communication and technology ICT engineering manufacturing and construction and natural science mathematics and statistics Women leave STEM disciplines in disproportionate numbers during their higher education studies in their transition to the world of work and even during their career cycle   Cross-national studies of learning achievement measuring knowledge acquisition or knowledge application from more than   countries and dependent territories present a complex picture In middle- to high-income countries for which trend data are available data gaps to girls disadvantage are closing particularly in science In addition in countries where girls do better than boys on curriculum-based assessments their score difference can be up to three times higher than when boys do better There are significant regional differences however For example girls outperform boys in many countries in Asia while the score difference between boys and girls in science achievement is particularly strong in the Arab States with girls significantly outperforming boys   More countries demonstrate gender differences to boys advantage in mathematics achievement with boys score differentials as compared to those of girls often increasing between early and late primary education Regional differences exist also in mathematics girls are particularly disadvantaged in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa Differences also exist between assessments that measure learning against the curriculum-based compared to those that measure students ability to apply knowledge and skills to different situations Boys performed better in two-thirds of the   countries measuring applied learning in math at age     Research on biological factors including brain structure and development genetics neuroscience and hormones shows that the gender gap in STEM is not the result of sex differences in these factors or in innate ability Rather findings suggest that learning is underpinned by neuroplasticity the capacity of the brain to expand and form new connections and that education performance including in STEM subjects is influenced by experience and can be improved through targeted interventions Spatial and language skills especially written language are positively correlated with performance in mathematics and can be improved with practice irrespective of sex especially during the earlier years of life   Criticism edit The focus on increasing participation in STEM fields has attracted criticism In the   article \"The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage\" in The Atlantic demographer Michael S Teitelbaum criticized the efforts of the U S government to increase the number of STEM graduates saying that among studies on the subject \"No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelor's degrees or higher\" and that \"Most studies report that real wages in many but not all science and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations \" Teitelbaum also wrote that the then-current national fixation on increasing STEM participation paralleled previous U S government efforts since World War II to increase the number of scientists and engineers all of which he stated ultimately ended up in \"mass layoffs hiring freezes and funding cuts\" including one driven by the Space Race of the late 1950s and 1960s which he wrote led to \"a bust of serious magnitude in the 1970s \"   IEEE Spectrum contributing editor Robert N Charette echoed these sentiments in the   article \"The STEM Crisis Is a Myth\" also noting that there was a \"mismatch between earning a STEM degree and having a STEM job\" in the United States with only around of STEM graduates working in STEM fields while less than half of workers in STEM fields have a STEM degree   Economics writer Ben Casselman in a   study of post-graduation earnings for FiveThirtyEight wrote that based on the data science should not be grouped with the other three STEM categories because while the other three generally result in high-paying jobs \"many sciences particularly the life sciences pay below the overall median for recent college graduates \"     edit American Indian Science and Engineering Society AISES Glossary of

economic strategy that brings different parties together for instance a company and a group of customers in order to jointly produce a mutually valued outcome   Co-creation brings a blend of ideas from direct customers or viewers who are not the direct users of the product which in turn creates new ideas to the organization Co-created value arises in the form of personalized unique experiences for the customer value-in-use and ongoing revenue learning and enhanced market performance drivers for the firm loyalty relationships customer word of mouth Value is co-created with customers if and when a customer is able to personalize his or her experience using a firm's product-service proposition in the lifetime of its use to a level that is best suited to get his or her job s or tasks done and which allows the firm to derive greater value from its product-service investment in the form of new knowledge higher revenues/profitability and/or superior brand value/loyalty   Scholars C K Prahalad and Venkat Ramaswamy popularized the concept in their   Harvard Business Review article \"Co-Opting Customer Competence\"   They developed their arguments further in their book published by the Harvard Business School Press The Future of Competition where they offered examples including Napster and Netflix showing that customers would no longer be satisfied with making yes or no decisions on what a company offers   Within the study of Prahalad and Ramaswamy   they defined co-creation as The joint creation of value by the company and the customer allowing the customer to co-construct the service experience to suit their context Prahalad and Ramaswamy   p   Maarten Pieters and Stefanie Jansen aimed to create clarity for organisations who struggled with implementing co-creation into their daily operations and introduced the term Complete co-creation in     which refers to the \"transparent process of value creation in ongoing productive collaboration with and supported by all relevant parties with end-users playing a central role\" Jansen and Pieters   p     It is regarded as a practical answer to the predominantly academic and holistic understanding of co-creation Complete co-creation actively involves end-users and other relevant parties in a full development process from the identification of a challenge to the implementation and tracking of its solution It is foremost a procedure which may evolve into an organisational principle and potentially even a co-ownership The process of Co-creation The process of co-creation essentially involves   core steps Contribution Submission of contributions by the public to the firm Selection Selection of the most promising and appealing contributions/submissions Types of Co-creation Depending on the degree of control exercised by the firm/public over the contribution and selection activities co-creation may be broadly classified into   categories Tinkering Public exercises control over the contribution activity while the firm exercises control over the selection activity Submitting Firm exercises complete control over both the activities Co-designing Firm exercises control over the contribution activity while the public exercises control over the selection activity Collaborating Public exercises complete control over both the activities Tinkering Tinkering is a customer co-creation model that involves procurement of contributions from the public by the firm a comprehensive and scrupulous examination of the contributions selection of the most promising and enterprising contributions by the firm and finally implementation of the contributions For example Little Big Planet a puzzle platform video game by Sony Interactive Entertainment allows the gamers to create their own levels in the game The created levels can then be shared with other gamers or submitted to Sony Owing to this \"Create and Share\" feature this game has the tagline 'Play Create Share' The most promising contributions are incorporated into the final game and the contributors are rewarded Submitting In the case of submitting the firm exercises control over the contribution activity by placing constraints on the basic design contribution size etc and also the selection activity by selecting the winning contributions Co-designing Co-designing involves placement of constraints by the firm on the contribution activity and selection of the winning contributions by the contributors themselves For example Local Motors employs the co-designing model of customer co-creation to develop its vehicles In   Local Motors developed a car named Rally Fighter in a record   months which is about   times faster than what a conventional car manufacturing process takes By empowering a community of over   designers to submit their designs while still placing some constraints on the basic design color schemes etc Local Motors effectively utilized the co-designing model of customer co-creation The winning design By Sangho Kim was chosen as the winning design by the designer community through voting An interesting bit of trivia about Local Motors is that it doesn't even have a design team All the designing is done by the public itself Threadless one of the leading T-shirt manufacturing brands in America also employs co-designing Collaborating Also known as open sourcing collaborating involves releasing the source code of the product and making it accessible to the general public The released source code is then open to modification as per the requirement of the users Examples like Mozilla Firefox Apache and Linux are all based on collaborating The Art of Co-creation The traditional company-centric view says   the consumer is outside the domain of the value chain   the enterprise controls where when and how value is added in the value chain   value is created in a series of activities controlled by the enterprise before the point of purchase   there is a single point of exchange where value is extracted from the customer for the enterprise The consumer-centric view says   the consumer is integral part of the system for value creation   the consumer can influence where when and how value is generated   the consumer need not respect industry boundaries in the search for value   the consumer can compete with companies for value extraction   there are multiple points of exchange where the consumer and the company can co-create value In the customer-centric mass production and marketing of automobiles for example suppliers provide raw materials components subcomponents and systems to manufacturers who create value by assembling these inputs into vehicles Consumers actively decide what vehicle to buy but companies decide what their choices will be Cars are sold by dealers acting as intermediaries for the automakers For companies reliant on this scenario value creation is defined solely by extracting profit from end consumers The Saturn Corporation billing itself as a different kind of car company has spurned the industry s traditional ways In   when the General Motors Corporation launched Saturn it didn t just start a new car company it created a community Saturn works with its customers in the design manufacturing and sales processes and it engages Saturn owners to help continuously innovate and improve its cars Consumers think about the place of a car in their life how it fits their budget their desire for comfort their need for peace of mind their aesthetics Companies think about their competitive strategy and their operations engineering differentiation logistics pricing and above all revenue and profit Although these views of value do clash they re not irreconcilable Saturn is a company trying to merge these two ways of looking at value In the pages that follow we present a framework a new value creation paradigm to suggest how companies can better understand the consumer s view of value and productively work with them to co-create more satisfying value for both sides   Contents   The four building blocks of interaction   From co-production   Early applications   Digital era types of customer

edit Prahalad and Ramaswamy   suggested that in order to apply co-creation the following fundamental requirements should be prepared in advance Terms Definition Managerial Implication Dialogue Interaction between customer Two-way connection instead of one-way selling strategy Access Allow customer to access the data Create value with customer beyond traditional value chain process Risk-benefit To monitor risk and gaps between customer and firm Share the risk of product development with guest through communication In later work of Ramaswamy   this is replaced by \"reflexivity\" Transparency Information among business is accessible Information barriers should be eliminated to certain degree in order to gain trust from guest From co-production edit In their review of the literature on \"customer participation in production\" Neeli Bendapudi and Robert P Leone found that the first academic work dates back to     From   onwards new themes are emerging John Czepiel suggests that customer's participation may lead to greater customer's satisfaction   Scott Kelley James Donnelly and Steven J Skinner are dealing with productivity but suggest other ways to look at customer participation quality employee's performance and emotional responses   Although not reviewed by Bendapuli and Leone the groundbreaking article by R Normann and R Ramirez suggests that successful companies do not focus on themselves or even on the industry but on the value-creating system   Michel Vargo and Lusch recognize the influence of Normann on their own work and acknowledge similarity between the concepts of co-production and co-creation \"his customer co-production mirrors the similar concept found in FP6\"   The authors suggest that Normann enriched the S-D Logic particularly through his idea of \"density\" of offerings In a letter sent to the editor of the Harvard Business Review in reaction to an article by Pine Peppers and Roger \"Do you want to keep your customers forever\" Michael Schrage argues that not all customers are alike in their capacity to bring some kind of knowledge to the firm   Wikstr m sees the role of consumers changing   Firat Fuat Dholakia and Venkatesh introduced the concept of customerization which is a buyer-centric evolution of the mass-customization process and stated that it enables consumers to serve as \"the co-producer of the product and service offering\"   However Bendapudi and Leone   concluded in an empirical paper that \"the assumption of greater customization under co-production may hold only when the customer has the expertise to craft a good or service to his or her liking\"   As noted by Zwass in his   taxonomy and review article on co-creation   the term \"co-creation\" was initially framed as a strategy by Dr Ajit Kambil and his coauthors in two articles in   and   In \"Reinventing Value Propositions\"   Kambil Ginsberg and Bloch illustrate how co-creation can be utilized as a strategy to transform value propositions working with customers or complementary resources   In \"Co-creation A new source of value\"   Kambil Friesen and Sundaram build out the concept of co-creation being a key source of value enabled by the Internet and provide a balanced view of risks companies must consider in utilizing this strategy   At the turn of the century Prahalad and Ramaswamy   popularized co-creation building on the prior work   In   Prahalad and Ramaswamy kept working on their ideas published four years earlier   At the same time Vargo and Lush   published on the service-dominant logic of marketing The process of value creation is dealt with in FP6 Opposing the goods-dominant logic and the service-dominant logic the authors state \"the customer is always a coproducer\" FP6 will be later Vargo and Lush   altered in \"the customer is always a co-creator\" Prahalad commented in an issue of the Journal of Marketing on Vargo and Lusch's FP6 and found that the authors did not go far enough   In the same book Kalaignanam and Varadarajan   also follow Prahalad's comments and elaborate on the IT implications on coproduction As the authors put it \"developments in information technology enable customers to create value by collaborating with the firm\" The main contribution of the authors in this article is a conceptual model of the intensity of customer participation as function of product characteristics market and customer characteristics firm characteristics In their conclusions and directions for future research the authors deal with three promising topics First they propose to study supply-side issues and how increasing communication participation from the customers and the emergence of communities enable customers to interact between them sometimes leading to new creations Second they see the \"locus of innovation\" as of interest and in particular how the shift of firm-centric networks to user-centric networks can lead to increased innovation capabilities Third they wonder whether demand-side issues may not result in negative consequences on satisfaction The third issue is already mentioned by Bendapuli and Leone \"A customer who believes he or she has the expertise and chooses to co-produce may be more likely to make self-attributions for success and failure than a customer who lacks the expertise A customer who lacks the expertise but feels forced to co-produce may make more negative attributions about co-production\"   Early applications edit In the early 2000s consultants and companies deployed co-creation as a tool for engaging customers in product design Examples include Nike giving customers online tools to design their own sneakers At a MacWorld conference in   Sam Lucente the legendary design and innovation guru at Hewlett-Packard described his epiphany that designers can no longer design products alone using their brilliance and magic They are no longer in the business of product and service design he stated they are really in the business of customer co-creation   During the mid-2000s co-creation became a driving concept in social media and marketing techniques where companies such as Converse persuaded large numbers of its most passionate customers to create their own video advertisements for the product The Web     phenomenon encompassed many forms of co-creation marketing as social and consumer communities became \"ambassadors\" \" buzz agents \" \" smart mobs \" and \"participants\" transforming the product experience Other examples of co-creation can be found in arts   Digital era types of customer co-creation edit Types of co-creation According to recent research conducted by Aric Rindfleisch and his former doctoral student Matt O'Hearn customer co-creation was categorized into four different types based on a two-by-two matrix It was based on two key steps in the customer co-creation process The X axis had the contribution step towards the idea creation/suggestion The Y-axis had the selection step for the proposed ideas And each of this axis had both a high and a low degree of customer control over each process Under contribution the first box was fixed which means that the customer has very little control over the contribution process and the firm will fix the types of contribution that it wants On selection under the firm-led process it was largely the firm that does the selection activity and the firm pick the winning submissions In the customer-led category the firm relies more on the customers to select the winning submissions Thus defining the four types of customer co-creation as below Submission This section has the least contribution in terms of idea submission by the customer and holds a high degree of firm-led selection in the limited ideas proposed by the customer Tinkering a unique type of co-creation where the customer comes up with a variety of ideas for the organization whereas the selection is defined by multiple parameters of the firm In tinkering the firm usually releases a final product e g Little Big Planet video games by Sony Although the users create the platform the firm decides which ones get published and distributed Collaborative a mix of leveraging both the firm and users to conclude with the final idea The customer has full liberty to suggest and select the idea along with the combined efforts of the firm E g Apache Server is a completely open source tool available on the web for all customers Co-designing the customer approach to select the limited ideas given by the customers Any community forum where customers have to give ideas into defined areas e g for the website of any company etc whereas the final idea is selected by the community forum by liking/disliking the proposed idea e g Threadless-where customer designs the T-shirt with his own innovation and idea whereas the firm restricts the customer to design only T-shirts and the final selection is done by the firm itself but customers have a strong voice in selecting contributions that move forward Corporate management edit During the mid-2000s these innovations in customer engagement and collaboration expanded and morphed into global economic trends including the co-created development of products and services Authors published bestselling books developing theories influenced by \"co-creation\" and customer collaboration Major concepts included crowdsourcing coined by Jeff Howe in a June   Wired magazine article   open innovation promoted by Henry Chesbrough   a professor and executive director at the Garwood Center for Corporate Innovation at Berkeley and consultant Don Tapscott 's and Anthony D Williams 's Wikinomics How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything   a book that popularized the concept of corporations using mass collaboration and open source innovation Of this rapid morphing of co-creation Ramaswamy and his co-author Francis Gouillart wrote \"Through their interactions with thousands of managers globally who had begun experimenting with co-creation they discovered that enterprises were building platforms that engaged not only the firm and its customers but also the entire network of suppliers partners and employees in a continuous development of new experiences with individuals \"   The rise of customer co-creation edit The rise of co-creation could be attributed to three distinct issues as suggested by O'hern & Rindfleisch     The information asymmetry between customer demands and manufacturer capability Customer empowerment The advent and widespread application of digital technology Process edit Successful co-creation requires two key steps   The contribution of ideas A firm must convince its customers to submit their ideas i e to contribute However receiving contribution is actually quite hard because most customers are quite busy and hardly care about the company's call Unless customers are incentivized in an attractive way they are reluctant to participate and benefit the company As a result most co-creation efforts fail because they don't get many submissions Selecting the viable ideas After receiving the contributions the firm must then select the most profitable viable and implementable ones The challenge of the selection process is that most submissions are not very useful impractical and difficult to implement Firms have to deal the submitted ideas in a very subtle way as throughout the process they don't want to reject customer submissions and risk of alienating them which may eventually lead to customer disengagement Advantages of co-creation edit Unexplored ideas emerges because of open conversations Everyone who contributes their idea feels that their contribution is heard out and hence the morale increases Challenges edit Although co-creation is an excellent activity to gather unique and various ideas from the customers but it brings a lot of challenges onto the table such as Pareto principle-Selection of the ideas from multiple redundant ideas submitted Only 20% of the submitted ideas out of the all holds value for any firm Risk in losing out on the brand image if the ideas highlight more on the negative scenarios of the firm's products or services   edit Co-design Co-marketing Marketing mix Service-dominant logic"},

article is about a design approach For factory built structures moved in modules see modular building Modular design or \" modularity in design\" is a design approach that subdivides a system into smaller parts called modules or skids that can be independently created and then used in different systems A modular system can be characterized by functional partitioning into discrete scalable reusable modules rigorous use of well-defined modular interfaces and making use of industry standards for interfaces Besides reduction in cost due to less customization and shorter learning time and flexibility in design modularity offers other benefits such as augmentation adding new solution by merely plugging in a new module and exclusion Examples of modular systems are cars computers process systems solar panels and wind turbines elevators and modular buildings Earlier examples include looms railroad signaling systems telephone exchanges pipe organs synthesizers and electric power distribution systems Evolution also results in the modular design of species in that homologous modules sharing approximately the same form or function appear in different organisms   Computers use modularity to overcome changing customer demands and to make the manufacturing process more adaptive to change see modular programming   Modular design is an attempt to combine the advantages of standardization high volume normally equals low manufacturing costs with those of customization A downside to modularity and this depends on the extent of modularity is that low quality modular

Electric vehicle and Wikispeed The modular design of the Unimog offers attachment capabilities for various different implements There is no use of modular design in automobiles although that has not always been the case All of the companies that comprise the automobile manufacturing industry have chosen to manufacture using short-lived non-standard replaceable parts instead of industry-standard or even merely company-standard interchangeable parts Almost all automobile parts are manufactured as short-run make and model specific mini-monopolies which allows for near-monopoly pricing limits innovation and promotes premature scrappage due to part unavailability Not only are firm standards not accepted by the industry but make/brand standards are also not utilized Finally there are no standards even within models over time In machines and architecture edit   Modular building Modular design can be seen in certain buildings Modular buildings and also modular homes generally consist of universal parts or modules that are manufactured in a factory and then shipped to a build site where they are assembled into a variety of arrangements   Modular buildings can be added to or reduced in size by adding or removing certain components This can be done without altering larger portions of the building Modular buildings can also undergo changes in functionality using the same process of adding or removing components Modular workstations For example an office building can be built using modular parts such as walls frames doors ceilings and windows The interior can then be partitioned or divided with more walls and furnished with desks computers and whatever else is needed for a functioning workspace If the office needs to be expanded or redivided to accommodate employees modular components such as wall panels can be added or relocated to make the necessary changes without altering the whole building Later this same office can be broken down and rearranged to form a retail space conference hall or another type of building using the same modular components that originally formed the office building The new building can then be refurnished with whatever items are needed to carry out its desired functions Other types of modular buildings that are offered from a company like Allied Modular include a guardhouse machine enclosure press box conference room two-story building clean room and many more applications   Many misconceptions are held regarding modular buildings   In reality modular construction is a viable method of construction for quick turnaround and fast growing companies Industries that would benefit from this include healthcare commercial retail military and multi-family/student housing In televisions edit In   Motorola introduced the first rectangular color picture tube and in   introduced the modular Quasar brand In   it opened its first research and development branch outside of the United States in Israel under the management of Moses Basin In   Motorola sold its television business to the Japan-based Matsushita the parent company of Panasonic In computer hardware edit Modular computer design Modular design in computer hardware is the same as in other things e g cars refrigerators and furniture The idea is to build computers with easily replaceable parts that use standardized interfaces This technique allows a user to upgrade certain aspects of the computer easily without having to buy another computer altogether This idea was also being implemented in Project Ara which provided a platform for manufactures to create modules for a smartphone which could then be customised by the end user A computer is one of the best examples of modular design Typical modules include power supply units processors mainboards graphics cards hard drives and optical drives All of these parts should be easily interchangeable as long as the user uses parts that support the same standard interface Similar to the computer's modularity other tools have been developed to leverage modular design such as littleBits Electronics which snap together with interoperable modules to create circuits   Modular Design Digital Twin and Industry     directions edit During the presentation of the PLM centre of University of Michigan Grieves   launched inside the modular design contest the initial idea of \"Conceptual ideal for PLM\" that introduces real space virtual space the link for data flow from real space to virtual space the link for information flow from virtual space to real space and virtual sub-spaces Egan   PTC Inc disclosed the strategy for an implementation of modular design in a PLM Product Lifecycle Management contest through a process that starts with a cross-functional input to the definition of the product architecture and includes an architecture development program that keeps the integrity of the product during its lifecycle Grieves   has produced an effective definition of digital twin A strategic business approach that applies a consistent set of business solutions in support of the collaborative creation management dissemination and use of product definition information across the extended enterprise from concept to end of life integrating people processes business systems and information Integrating Lifecycle and Energy assessments into modular design edit Some authors observe that modular design has generated in the vehicle industry a constant increase of weight over time Trancossi   advanced the hypothesis that modular design can be coupled by some optimization criteria derived from the constructal law In fact the constructal law is modular for his nature and can apply with interesting results in engineering simple systems   It applies with a typical bottom-up optimization schema a system can be divided into subsystems elemental parts using tree models any complex system can be represented in a modular way and it is possible to describe how different physical magnitudes flow through the system analysing the different flowpaths it is possible to identify the critical components that affect the performance of the system by optimizing those components and substituting them with more performing ones it is possible to improve the performances of the system A better formulation has been produced during the MAAT EU FP7 Project   A new design method that couples the above bottom-up optimization with a preliminary system level top-down design has been formulated   The two step design process has been motivated by considering that constructal and modular design does not refer to any objective to be reached in the design process A theoretical formulation has been provided in a recent paper   and applied with success to the design of a small aircraft   the conceptual design of innovative commuter aircraft     the design of a new entropic wall   and an innovative off-road vehicle designed for energy efficiency     edit

President Simon Phipps Website opensource org The Open Source Initiative OSI is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting open-source software The organization was founded in late February   by Bruce Perens and Eric S Raymond part of a group inspired by the Netscape Communications Corporation publishing the source code for its flagship Netscape Communicator product Later in August   the organization added a board of directors Raymond was president from its founding until February   followed briefly by Russ Nelson and then Michael Tiemann In May   the new board elected Simon Phipps as president   and in May   Allison Randal was elected as president   when Phipps stepped down in preparation for the   end of his Board term   Phipps became President again in September     Contents   History   Relationship with the free software movement   Board members       References     History edit As a campaign of sorts \"open source\" was launched in   by Jon \"maddog\" Hall Larry Augustin Eric S Raymond Bruce Perens and others     The group adopted the Open Source Definition for open-source software based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines They also established the Open Source Initiative OSI as a steward organization for the movement However they were unsuccessful in their attempt to secure a trademark for 'open source' to control the use of the term   In   in an apparent effort to reform governance of the organization the OSI Board invited   individuals to join a \"Charter Members\" group by   July     of the original invitees had accepted the invitations The full membership of the Charter Members has never been publicly revealed and the Charter Members group communicated by way of a closed-subscription mailing list \"osi-discuss\" with non-public archives   Public information indicates that the group included Bradley M Kuhn Karl Fogel Jim Blandy Chamindra da Silva Lawrence Rosen and David Ascher       Then-OSI Board member Danese Cooper was the principal moderator of osi-discuss   Kuhn later recollected that the Charter Membership was a \"brouhaha bordering on a flame fest \" and took no action   In   the OSI was temporarily suspended from operation as a California corporation apparently in response to a complaint concerning tax paperwork from earlier years   clarification needed Its current status is \"Active\"   In   under the leadership of OSI director and then-president Simon Phipps the OSI began transitioning towards a membership-based governance structure The OSI initiated an Affiliate Membership program for \"government-recognized non-profit charitable and not-for-profit industry associations and academic institutions anywhere in the world\"   Subsequently the OSI announced an Individual Membership program   and listed a number of Corporate Sponsors   On November     OSI appointed Patrick Masson as its General Manager   Relationship with the free software movement edit Both the modern free software movement launched by Richard Stallman in the early 1980s and the Open Source Initiative were born from a common history of Unix Internet free software and the hacker culture but their basic goals and philosophy differ The Open Source Initiative chose the term \"open source \" in founding member Michael Tiemann 's words to \"dump the moralizing and confrontational attitude that had been associated with 'free software'\" and instead promote open source ideas on \"pragmatic business-case grounds \"   As early as   OSI co-founder Perens objected to the \"schism\" that was developing between supporters of Stallman's Free Software Foundation FSF and the OSI because of their disparate approaches Perens had hoped the OSI would merely serve as an \"introduction\" to FSF principles for \"non-hackers \"   Stallman has sharply criticized the OSI for its pragmatic focus and for ignoring what he considers the central \"ethical imperative\" and emphasis on \"freedom\" underlying free software as he defines it   Nevertheless Stallman has described his free software movement and the Open Source Initiative as separate camps within the same broad free-software community and acknowledged that despite philosophical differences proponents of open source and free software \"often work together on practical projects \"   Board members edit The current Open Source Initiative board of Directors is

it and may also have various properties of how it was designed e g open process There is no single definition and interpretations vary with usage The terms open and standard have a wide range of meanings associated with their usage There are a number of definitions of open standards which emphasize different aspects of openness including the openness of the resulting specification the openness of the drafting process and the ownership of rights in the standard The term \"standard\" is sometimes restricted to technologies approved by formalized committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate on a consensus basis The definitions of the term open standard used by academics the European Union and some of its member governments or parliaments such as Denmark France and Spain preclude open standards requiring fees for use as do the New Zealand South African and the Venezuelan governments On the standard organisation side the World Wide Web Consortium W3C ensures that its specifications can be implemented on a royalty-free basis Many definitions of the term standard permit patent holders to impose \"reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing\" royalty fees and other licensing terms on implementers or users of the standard For example the rules for standards published by the major internationally recognized standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF International Organization for Standardization ISO International Electrotechnical Commission IEC and ITU-T permit their standards to contain specifications whose implementation will require payment of patent licensing fees Among these organizations only the IETF and ITU-T explicitly refer to their standards as \"open standards\" while the others refer only to producing \"standards\" The IETF and ITU-T use definitions of \"open standard\" that allow \"reasonable and non-discriminatory\" patent licensing fee requirements There are those in the open-source software community who hold that an \"open standard\" is only open if it can be freely adopted implemented and extended   While open standards or architectures are considered non-proprietary in the sense that the standard is either unowned or owned by a collective body it can still be publicly shared and not tightly guarded   The typical example of open source that has become a standard is the personal computer originated by IBM and now referred to as Wintel the combination of the Microsoft operating system and Intel microprocessor There are three others that are most widely accepted as open which include the GSM phones adopted as a government standard Open Group which promotes UNIX and the like and the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF which created the first standards of SMTP and TCP/IP Buyers tend to prefer open standards which they believe offer them cheaper products and more choice for access due to network effects and increased competition between vendors   Open standards which specify formats are sometimes referred to as open formats Many specifications that are sometimes referred to as standards are proprietary and only available under restrictive contract terms if they can be obtained at all from the organization that owns the copyright on the specification As such these specifications are not considered to be fully open Joel West has argued that \"open\" standards are not black and white but have many different levels of \"openness\" Ultimately a standard needs according to whom? to be open enough that it will become adopted and accepted in the market but still closed enough that firms can get a return on their investment in developing the technology around the standard A more open standard tends to occur when the knowledge of the technology becomes dispersed enough that competition is increased and others are able to start copying the technology as they implement it This occurred with the Wintel architecture as others were able to start imitating the software Less open standards exist when a particular firm has much power not ownership over the standard which can occur when a firm s platform wins in standard setting or the market makes one platform most popular   Contents   Specific definitions of an open standard     Joint IEEE ISOC W3C IETF and IAB Definition     ITU-T definition

Consortium W3C Internet Engineering Task Force IETF and Internet Architecture Board IAB jointly affirmed a set of principles which have contributed to the exponential growth of the Internet and related technologies The OpenStand Principles define open standards and establish the building blocks for innovation Standards developed using the OpenStand principles are developed through an open participatory process support interoperability foster global competition are voluntarily adopted on a global level and serve as building blocks for products and services targeted to meet the needs of markets and consumers This drives innovation which in turn contributes to the creation of new markets and the growth and expansion of existing markets There are five key OpenStand Principles as outlined below   Cooperation Respectful cooperation between standards organizations whereby each respects the autonomy integrity processes and intellectual property rules of the others   Adherence to Principles - Adherence to the five fundamental principles of standards development namely Due process Decisions are made with equity and fairness among participants No one party dominates or guides standards development Standards processes are transparent and opportunities exist to appeal decisions Processes for periodic standards review and updating are well defined Broad consensus Processes allow for all views to be considered and addressed such that agreement can be found across a range of interests Transparency Standards organizations provide advance public notice of proposed standards development activities the scope of work to be undertaken and conditions for participation Easily accessible records of decisions and the materials used in reaching those decisions are provided Public comment periods are provided before final standards approval and adoption Balance Standards activities are not exclusively dominated by any particular person company or interest group Openness Standards processes are open to all interested and informed parties   Collective Empowerment Commitment by affirming standards organizations and their participants to collective empowerment by striving for standards that are chosen and defined based on technical merit as judged by the contributed expertise of each participant provide global interoperability scalability stability and resiliency enable global competition serve as building blocks for further innovation and contribute to the creation of global communities benefiting humanity   Availability Standards specifications are made accessible to all for implementation and deployment Affirming standards organizations have defined procedures to develop specifications that can be implemented under fair terms Given market diversity fair terms may vary from royalty-free to fair reasonable and non-discriminatory terms FRAND   Voluntary Adoption Standards are voluntarily adopted and success is determined by the market   ITU-T definition edit The ITU-T is a standards development organization SDO that is one of the three sectors of the International Telecommunications Union a specialized agency of the United Nations The ITU-T has a Telecommunication Standardization Bureau director's Ad Hoc group on IPR that produced the following definition in March   which the ITU-T as a whole has endorsed for its purposes since November     The ITU-T has a long history of open standards development However recently some different external sources have attempted to define the term \"Open Standard\" in a variety of different ways In order to avoid confusion the ITU-T uses for its purpose the term \"Open Standards\" per the following definition \"Open Standards\" are standards made available to the general public and are developed or approved and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process \"Open Standards\" facilitate interoperability and data exchange among different products or services and are intended for widespread adoption Other elements of \"Open Standards\" include but are not limited to Collaborative process voluntary and market driven development or approval following a transparent consensus driven process that is reasonably open to all interested parties Reasonably balanced ensures that the process is not dominated by any one interest group Due process - includes consideration of and response to comments by interested parties Intellectual property rights IPRs IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide non-discriminatory basis either   for free and under other reasonable terms and conditions or   on reasonable terms and conditions which may include monetary compensation Negotiations are left to the parties concerned and are performed outside the SDO Quality and level of detail sufficient to permit the development of a variety of competing implementations of interoperable products or services Standardized interfaces are not hidden or controlled other than by the SDO promulgating the standard Publicly available easily available for implementation and use at a reasonable price Publication of the text of a standard by others is permitted only with the prior approval of the SDO On-going support maintained and supported over a long period of time The ITU-T ITU-R ISO and IEC have harmonized on a common patent policy   under the banner of the WSC However the ITU-T definition should not necessarily be considered also applicable in ITU-R ISO and IEC contexts since the Common Patent Policy   does not make any reference to \"open standards\" but rather only to \"standards \" IETF definition edit In section   of its RFC   the IETF classifies specifications that have been developed in a manner similar to that of the IETF itself as being \"open standards \" and lists the standards produced by ANSI ISO IEEE and ITU-T as examples As the IETF standardization processes and IPR policies have the characteristics listed above by ITU-T the IETF standards fulfill the ITU-T definition of \"open standards \" However the IETF has not adopted a specific definition of \"open standard\" both RFC   and the IETF's mission statement RFC   talks about \"open process \" but RFC   does not define \"open standard\" except for the purpose of defining what documents IETF standards can link to RFC   belongs to a set of RFCs collectively known as BCP   Best Common Practice an IETF policy   RFC   was later updated by BCP   and   among others As of   BCP   is RFC   Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust   and BCP   consists of RFC   Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology and a clarification in RFC     The changes are intended to be compatible with the \"Simplified BSD License\" as stated in the IETF Trust Legal Provisions and Copyright FAQ based on RFC     In August   the IETF combined with the W3C and IEEE to launch OpenStand   and to publish The Modern Paradigm for Standards This captures \"the effective and efficient standardization processes that have made the Internet and Web the premiere platforms for innovation and borderless commerce\" The declaration is then published in the form of RFC   in January   European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services edit The European Union defined the term for use within its European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services Version       although it does not claim to be a universal definition for all European Union use and documentation To reach interoperability in the context of pan-European eGovernment services guidance needs to focus on open standards The word \"open\" is here meant in the sense of fulfilling the following requirements The standard is adopted and will be maintained by a not-for-profit organization and its ongoing development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure available to all interested parties consensus or majority decision etc The standard has been published and the standard specification document is available either freely or at a nominal charge It must be permissible to all to copy distribute and use it for no fee or at a nominal fee The intellectual property - i e patents possibly present - of parts of the standard is made irrevocably available on a royalty-free basis There are no constraints on the re-use of the standard   Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium definition edit The Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium NCOIC defines open standard as the following Specifications for hardware and/or software that are publicly available implying that multiple vendors can compete directly based on the features and performance of their products It also implies that the existing open system can be removed and replaced with that of another vendor with minimal effort and without major interruption   Danish government definition edit The Danish government has attempted to make a definition of open standards   which also is used in pan-European software development projects It states An open standard is accessible to everyone free of charge i e there is no discrimination between users and no payment or other considerations are required as a condition of use of the standard An open standard of necessity remains accessible and free of charge i e owners renounce their options if indeed such exist to limit access to the standard at a later date for example by committing themselves to openness during the remainder of a possible patent's life An open standard is accessible free of charge and documented in all its details i e all aspects of the standard are transparent and documented and both access to and use of the documentation is free French law definition edit The French Parliament approved a definition of \"open standard\" in its \"Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy \"   The definition is   By open standard is understood any communication interconnection or interchange protocol and any interoperable data format whose specifications are public and without any restriction in their access or implementation Indian Government Definition edit A clear Royalty Free stance and far reaching requirements case is the one for India's Government       Mandatory Characteristics An Identified Standard will qualify as an Open Standard if it meets the following criteria       Specification document of the Identified Standard shall be available with or without a nominal fee       The Patent claims necessary to implement the Identified Standard shall be made available on a Royalty-Free basis for the lifetime of the Standard       Identified Standard shall be adopted and maintained by a not-for-profit organization wherein all stakeholders can opt to participate in a transparent collaborative and consensual manner       Identified Standard shall be recursively open as far as possible       Identified Standard shall have technology-neutral specification       Identified Standard shall be capable of localization support where applicable for all Indian official Languages for all applicable domains Italian Law definition edit Italy has a general rule for the entire public sector dealing with Open Standards although concentrating on data formats in Art   of the Code of the Digital Administration Codice dell'Amministrazione Digitale   applications must allow representation of data under different formats at least one being an open data format it is defined an open data format a data format which is made public is thoroughly documented and neutral with regard to the technological tools needed to peruse the same data Spanish law definition edit A Law passed by the Spanish Parliament   requires that all electronic services provided by the Spanish public administration must be based on open standards It defines an open standard as royalty free according to the following definition   An open standard fulfills the following conditions it is public and its use is available on a free gratis basis or at a cost that does not imply a difficulty for the user its use is not subject to the payment of any intellectual copyright or industrial patents and trademarks property right Venezuelan law definition edit The Venezuelan Government approved a \"free software and open standards law \"   The decree includes the requirement that the Venezuelan public sector must use free software based on open standards and includes a definition of open standard   Article   for the purposes of this Decree it shall be understood as k Open standards technical specifications published and controlled by an organization in charge of their development that have been accepted by the industry available to everybody for their implementation in free software or other type of software promoting competitivity interoperability and flexibility South African Government definition edit The South African Government approved a definition in the \"Minimum Interoperability Operating Standards Handbook\" MIOS   For the purposes of the MIOS a standard shall be considered open if it meets all of these criteria There are standards which we are obliged to adopt for pragmatic reasons which do not necessarily fully conform to being open in all respects In such cases where an open standard does not yet exist the degree of openness will be taken into account when selecting an appropriate standard it should be maintained by a non-commercial organization participation in the ongoing development work is based on decision making processes that are open to all interested parties open access all may access committee documents drafts and completed standards free of cost or for a negligible fee It must be possible for everyone to copy distribute and use the standard free of cost The intellectual rights required to implement the standard e g essential patent claims are irrevocably available without any royalties attached There are no reservations regarding reuse of the standard There are multiple implementations of the standard New Zealand official interoperability framework definition edit The E-Government Interoperability Framework e-GIF   defines open standard as royalty free according to the following text While a universally agreed definition of \"open standards\" is unlikely to be resolved in the near future the e-GIF accepts that a definition of open standards needs to recognise a continuum that ranges from closed to open and encompasses varying degrees of \"openness \" To guide readers in this respect the e-GIF endorses \"open standards\" that exhibit the following properties Be accessible to everyone free of charge no discrimination between users and no payment or other considerations should be required as a condition to use the standard Remain accessible to everyone free of charge owners should renounce their options if any to limit access to the standard at a later date Be documented in all its details all aspects of the standard should be transparent and documented and both access to and use of the documentation should be free The e-GIF performs the same function in e-government as the Road Code does on the highways Driving would be excessively costly inefficient and ineffective if road rules had to be agreed each time one vehicle encountered another Bruce Perens' definition edit One of the most popular definitions of the term \"open standard \" as measured by Google ranking is the one developed by Bruce Perens   His definition lists a set of principles that he believes must be met by an open standard Availability Open Standards are available for all to read and implement Maximize End-User Choice Open Standards create a fair competitive market for implementations of the standard They do not lock the customer into a particular vendor or group No Royalty Open Standards are free for all to implement with no royalty or fee Certification of compliance by the standards organization may involve a fee No Discrimination Open Standards and the organizations that administer them do not favor one implementor over another for any reason other than the technical standards compliance of a vendor s implementation Certification organizations must provide a path for low and zero-cost implementations to be validated but may also provide enhanced certification services Extension or Subset Implementations of Open Standards may be extended or offered in subset form However certification organizations may decline to certify subset implementations and may place requirements upon extensions see Predatory Practices Predatory Practices Open Standards may employ license terms that protect against subversion of the standard by embrace-and-extend tactics The licenses attached to the standard may require the publication of reference information for extensions and a license for all others to create distribute and sell software that is compatible with the extensions An Open Standard may not otherwise prohibit extensions Microsoft's definition edit Vijay Kapoor national technology officer Microsoft defines what open standards are as follows   Let's look at what an open standard means 'open' refers to it being royalty-free while 'standard' means a technology approved by formalized committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate on a consensus basis An open standard is publicly available and developed approved and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process Overall Microsoft's relationship to open standards was at best mixed While Microsoft participated in the most significant standard-setting organizations that establish open standards it was often seen as oppositional to their adoption   Open Source Initiative's definition edit The Open Source Initiative defines the requirements and criteria for open standards as follows   The Requirement An \"open standard\" must not prohibit conforming implementations in open source software The Criteria To comply with the Open Standards Requirement an \"open standard\" must satisfy the following criteria If an \"open standard\" does not meet these criteria it will be discriminating against open source developers No Intentional Secrets The standard MUST NOT withhold any detail necessary for interoperable implementation As flaws are inevitable the standard MUST define a process for fixing flaws identified during implementation and interoperability testing and to incorporate said changes into a revised version or superseding version of the standard to be released under terms that do not violate the OSR Availability The standard MUST be freely and publicly available e g from a stable web site under royalty-free terms at reasonable and non-discriminatory cost Patents All patents essential to implementation of the standard MUST be licensed under royalty-free terms for unrestricted use or be covered by a promise of non-assertion when practiced by open source software No Agreements There MUST NOT be any requirement for execution of a license agreement NDA grant click-through or any other form of paperwork to deploy conforming implementations of the standard No OSR-Incompatible Dependencies Implementation of the standard MUST NOT require any other technology that fails to meet the criteria of this Requirement Ken Krechmer's definition edit Ken Krechmer   identifies ten \"rights\" Open Meeting Consensus Due Process Open IPR One World Open Change Open Documents Open Interface Open Use On-going Support World Wide Web Consortium's definition edit As an important provider of Web technology ICT Standards notably XML http HTML CSS and WAI the World Wide Web Consortium W3C follows a process that promotes the development of high-quality standards   Looking at the end result the spec alone up for adoption is not enough The participative/inclusive process leading to a particular design and the supporting resources available with it should be accounted when we talk about Open Standards transparency due process is public and all technical discussions meeting minutes are archived and referencable in decision making relevance new standardization is started upon due analysis of the market needs including requirements phase e g accessibility multi-linguism openness anybody can participate and everybody does industry individual public government bodies academia on a worldwide scale impartiality and consensus guaranteed fairness by the process and the neutral hosting of the W3C organization with equal weight for each participant availability free access to the standard text both during development at final stage and for translations and assurance that core Web and Internet technologies can be implemented Royalty-Free maintenance ongoing process for testing errata revision permanent access validation etc In August   the W3C combined with the IETF and IEEE to launch OpenStand   and to publish The Modern Paradigm for Standards This captures \"the effective and efficient standardization processes that have made the Internet and Web the premiere platforms for innovation and borderless commerce\" Digital Standards Organization definition edit The Digital Standards Organization DIGISTAN states that \"an open standard must be aimed at creating unrestricted competition between vendors and unrestricted choice for users \"   Its brief definition of \"open standard\" or \"free and open standard\" is \"a published specification that is immune to vendor capture at all stages in its life-cycle \" Its more complete definition as follows \"The standard is adopted and will be maintained by a not-for-profit organization and its ongoing development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure available to all interested parties The standard has been published and the standard specification document is available freely It must be permissible to all to copy distribute and use it freely The patents possibly present on parts of the standard are made irrevocably available on a royalty-free basis There are no constraints on the re-use of the standard A key defining property is that an open standard is immune to vendor capture at all stages in its life-cycle Immunity from vendor capture makes it possible to improve upon trust and extend an open standard over time \"   This definition is based on the EU's EIF v1 definition of \"open standard \" but with changes to address what it terms as \"vendor capture \" They believe that \"Many groups and individuals have provided definitions for 'open standard' that reflect their economic interests in the standards process We see that the fundamental conflict is between vendors who seek to capture markets and raise costs and the market at large which seeks freedom and lower costs Vendors work hard to turn open standards into franchise standards They work to change the statutory language so they can cloak franchise standards in the sheep's clothing of 'open standard ' A robust definition of \"free and open standard\" must thus take into account the direct economic conflict between vendors and the market at large \"   Free Software Foundation Europe's definition edit The Free Software Foundation Europe FSFE uses a definition which is based on the European Interoperability Framework v   and was extended after consultation with industry and community stakeholders FSFE's standard has been adopted by groups such as the SELF EU Project the   Geneva Declaration on Standards and the Future of the Internet and international Document Freedom Day teams According to this definition an Open Standard is a format or protocol that is Subject to full public assessment and use without constraints in a manner equally available to all parties Without any components or extensions that have dependencies on formats or protocols that do not meet the definition of an Open Standard themselves Free from legal or technical clauses that limit its utilisation by any party or in any business model Managed and further developed independently of any single vendor in a process open to the equal participation of competitors and third parties Available in multiple complete implementations by competing vendors or as a complete implementation equally available to all parties FFII's definition edit The Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure 's definition is said by whom? to coincide with the definition issued in the European Interoperability Framework released in   A specification that is public the standard is inclusive and it has been developed and is maintained in an open standardization process everybody can implement it without any restriction neither payment to license the IPR granted to everybody for free and without any condition This is the minimum license terms asked by standardization bodies as W3C Of course all the other bodies accept open standards But specification itself could cost a fair amount of money ie 100-400Eur per copy as in ISO because copyright and publication of the document itself UK government definition edit The UK government's definition of open standards applies to software interoperability data and document formats The criteria for open standards are published in the Open Standards Principles policy paper and are as follows Collaboration - the standard is maintained through a collaborative decision-making process that is consensus based and independent of any individual supplier Involvement in the development and maintenance of the standard is accessible to all interested parties Transparency - the decision-making process is transparent and a publicly accessible review by subject matter experts is part of the process Due process - the standard is adopted by a specification or standardisation organisation or a forum or consortium with a feedback and ratification process to ensure quality Fair access - the standard is published thoroughly documented and publicly available at zero or low cost Zero cost is preferred but this should be considered on a case by case basis as part of the selection process Cost should not be prohibitive or likely to cause a barrier to a level playing field Market support - other than in the context of creating innovative solutions the standard is mature supported by the market and demonstrates platform application and vendor independence Rights - rights essential to implementation of the standard and for interfacing with other implementations which have adopted that same standard are licensed on a royalty free basis that is compatible with both open source and proprietary licensed solutions These rights should be irrevocable unless there is a breach of licence conditions Comparison of definitions edit Publisher Time of pub lication Availa bility Usage rights Process Complete ness The spec

reasonable and non-discriminatory RAND licensing for the use of patented technology in web standards increased Bruce Perens important associations as FSF or FFII and others have argued that the use of patents restricts who can implement a standard to those able or willing to pay for the use of the patented technology The requirement to pay some small amount per user is often an insurmountable problem for free/open source software implementations which can be redistributed by anyone Royalty free RF licensing is generally the only possible license for free/open source software implementations Version   of the GNU General Public License includes a section that enjoins anyone who distributes a program released under the GPL from enforcing patents on subsequent users of the software or derivative works One result of this controversy was that many governments including the Danish French and Spanish governments singly and the EU collectively specifically affirmed that \"open standards\" required royalty-free licenses Some standards organizations such as the W3C modified their processes to essentially only permit royalty-free licensing Patents for software formulas and algorithms are currently enforceable in the US but not in the EU The European Patent Convention Article   paragraph   c expressly prohibits algorithms business methods and software from being covered by patents The US has only allowed them since   and there has been growing controversy in recent years as to either the benefit or feasibility A standards body and its associated processes cannot force a patent holder to give up its right to charge license fees especially if the company concerned is not a member of the standards body and unconstrained by any rules that were set during the standards development process In fact this element discourages some standards bodies from adopting an \"open\" approach fearing that they will lose out if their members are more constrained than non-members Few bodies will carry out or require their members to carry out a full patent search Ultimately the only sanctions a standards body can apply on a non-member when patent licensing is demanded is to cancel the standard try to rework around it or work to invalidate the patent Standards bodies such as W3C and OASIS require citation needed that the use of required patents be granted under a royalty-free license as a condition for joining the body or a particular working group and this is generally considered enforceable citation needed Examples of patent claims brought against standards previously thought to be open include JPEG and the Rambus case over DDR SDRAM The H   video codec is an example of a standards organization producing a standard that has known non-royalty-free required patents Often the scope of the standard itself determines how likely it is that a firm will be able to use a standard as patent-like protection Richard Langlois argues that standards with a wide scope may offer a firm some level of protection from competitors but it is likely that Schumpeterian creative destruction will ultimately leave the firm open to being \"invented around\" regardless of the standard a firm may benefit from   Quotes edit EU Commissioner Erkki Liikanen \"Open standards are important to help create interoperable and affordable solutions for everybody They also promote competition by setting up a technical playing field that is level to all market players This means lower costs for enterprises and ultimately the consumer \" World Standards Day   October     Jorma Ollila Chairman of Nokia's Board of Directors \" Open standards and platforms create a foundation for success They enable interoperability of technologies and

structural parts Open-source hardware OSH consists of physical artifacts of technology designed and offered by the open design movement Both free and open-source software FOSS and open-source hardware are created by this open-source culture movement and apply a like concept to a variety of components It is sometimes thus referred to as FOSH free and open-source hardware The term usually means that information about the hardware is easily discerned so that others can make it coupling it closely to the maker movement   Hardware design i e mechanical drawings schematics bills of material PCB layout data HDL source code   and integrated circuit layout data in addition to the software that drives the hardware are all released under free/ libre terms The original sharer gains feedback and potentially improvements on the design from the FOSH community There is now significant evidence that such sharing can drive a high return on investment for investors   Since the rise of reconfigurable programmable logic devices sharing of logic designs has been a form of open-source hardware Instead of the schematics hardware description language HDL code is shared HDL descriptions

focused \" open source \" activities were started around   by Bruce Perens creator of the Open Source Definition co-founder of the Open Source Initiative and a ham radio operator He launched the Open Hardware Certification Program which had the goal of allowing hardware manufacturers to self-certify their products as open     Shortly after the launch of the Open Hardware Certification Program David Freeman announced the Open Hardware Specification Project OHSpec another attempt at licensing hardware components whose interfaces are available publicly and of creating an entirely new computing platform as an alternative to proprietary computing systems   In early   Sepehr Kiani Ryan Vallance and Samir Nayfeh joined efforts to apply the open-source philosophy to machine design applications Together they established the Open Design Foundation ODF as a non-profit corporation and set out to develop an Open Design Definition But most of these activities faded out after a few years By the mid 2000s open-source hardware again became a hub of activity due to the emergence of several major open-source hardware projects and companies such as OpenCores RepRap 3D printing Arduino Adafruit and SparkFun In   Perens reactivated the openhardware org website Following the Open Graphics Project an effort to design implement and manufacture a free and open 3D graphics chip set and reference graphics card Timothy Miller suggested the creation of an organization to safeguard the interests of the Open Graphics Project community Thus Patrick McNamara founded the Open Hardware Foundation OHF in     The Tucson Amateur Packet Radio Corporation TAPR founded in   as a non-profit organization of amateur radio operators with the goals of supporting R&D efforts in the area of amateur digital communications created in   the first open hardware license the TAPR Open Hardware License The OSI president Eric S Raymond expressed some concerns about certain aspects of the OHL and decided to not review the license   Around   in context of the Freedom Defined project the Open Hardware Definition was created as collaborative work of many   and is accepted as of   by dozens of organizations and companies   In July   CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research released an open-source hardware license CERN OHL Javier Serrano an engineer at CERN's Beams Department and the founder of the Open Hardware Repository explained \"By sharing designs openly CERN expects to improve the quality of designs through peer review and to guarantee their users including commercial companies the freedom to study modify and manufacture them leading to better hardware and less duplication of efforts\"   While initially drafted to address CERN-specific concerns such as tracing the impact of the organization s research in its current form it can be used by anyone developing open-source hardware   Following the   Open Hardware Summit and after heated debates on licenses and what constitutes open-source hardware Bruce Perens abandoned the OSHW Definition and the concerted efforts of those involved with it   Openhardware org led by Bruce Perens promotes and identifies practices that meet all the combined requirements of the Open Source Hardware Definition the Open Source Definition and the Four Freedoms of the Free Software Foundation   Since   openhardware org is not online and seems to have ceased activity   The Open Source Hardware Association OSHWA at oshwa org proposes Open source hardware and acts as hub of open source hardware activity of all genres while cooperating with other entities such as TAPR CERN and OSI The OSHWA was established as an organization in June   in Delaware and filed for tax exemption status in July     After same debates about trademark interferences with the OSI in   the OSHWA and the OSI signed a co-existence agreement     In   after years of skepticism on the relevance of free hardware designs   the Free Software Foundation started the \" Respects Your Freedom \" RYF computer hardware product certification program It was intended to encourage the creation and sale of hardware that respects users' freedom and privacy and aims to ensure that users have control over their devices     RYF certified laptops faced criticism on the basis of being slow and outdated hardware     FSF's Replicant project suggested in   an alternative \"free hardware\" definition derived from the FSF's four freedoms   Forms of open-source hardware edit The term hardware in open source hardware has been historically used in opposition to the term software of open source software That is to refer to the electronic hardware on which the software runs see previous section However as more and more non-electronic hardware products are made open source for example Wikihouse OpenBeam or Hovalin this term tends to be used back in its broader sense of \"physical product\" The field of open source hardware has been shown to go beyond electronic hardware and to cover a larger range of product categories such as machine tools vehicles and medical equipment   In that sense hardware refers to any form of tangible product may it be electronic hardware mechanical hardware textile or even construction hardware The Open Source Hardware OSHW Definition     defines hardware as \"tangible artifacts machines devices or other physical things\"   Computers edit Due to a mixture of privacy security and environmental concerns a number of projects have started that aim to deliver a variety of open-source computing devices Examples include the EOMA68 SBC in a PCMCIA form-factor intended to be plugged into a laptop or desktop chassis Novena bare motherboard with optional laptop chassis and GnuBee series of Network Attached Storage devices Several retrocomputing hobby groups have created numerous recreations or adaptations of the early home computers of the 1970s and 80s some of which include improved functionality and more modern components such as surface-moun t ICs and SD card readers       Some hobbyists have also developed add-on cards such as drive controllers   memory expansion   and sound cards   to improve the functionality of older computers Miniaturised recreations of vintage computers have also been created   Electronics edit One of the most popular types of open-source hardware is electronics There are numerous companies that provide large varieties of open-source electronics such as Sparkfun Adafruit and Seeed In addition there are NPOs and companies that provide a specific open-source electronic component such as the Arduino electronics prototyping platform There are numerous examples of speciality open-source electronics such as low-cost voltage and current GMAW open-source 3-D printer monitor     and a robotics-assisted mass spectrometry assay platform     Open-source electronics finds various uses including automation of chemical procedures     Mecha tro nics edit A large range of products including mechanical components have been developed so far from machine tools to vehicles over musical instruments and medical equipment   Examples of machine-tools are the 3D printers RepRap and Ultimaker as well as the laser cutter Lasersaur In the category vehicles we can find bikes like XYZ Space Frame Vehicles and cars like the Tabby OSVehicle Examples of medical equipment are the echostethoscope echOpen and a wide range of prosthetic hands listed in the review study by Ten Kate et al   e g the OpenBionics Prosthetic Hands Others edit Examples of open-source hardware products can also be found to a lesser extent in construction Wikihouse and textile Kit Z ro Kilom tres Licenses edit Rather than creating a new license some open-source hardware projects simply use existing free and open-source software licenses   These licenses may not accord well with patent law   Later several new licenses have been proposed designed to address issues specific to hardware designs   In these licenses many of the fundamental principles expressed in open-source software OSS licenses have been \"ported\" to their counterpart hardware projects New hardware licenses are often explained as the \"hardware equivalent\" of a well-known OSS license such as the GPL LGPL or BSD license Despite superficial similarities to software licenses most hardware licenses are fundamentally different by nature they typically rely more heavily on patent law than on copyright law as many hardware designs are not copyrightable   Whereas a copyright license may control the distribution of the source code or design documents a patent license may control the use and manufacturing of the physical device built from the design documents This distinction is explicitly mentioned in the preamble of the TAPR Open Hardware License \" those who benefit from an OHL design may not bring lawsuits claiming that design infringes their patents or other intellectual property \" TAPR Open Hardware License   Noteworthy licenses include The TAPR Open Hardware License drafted by attorney John Ackermann reviewed by OSS community leaders Bruce Perens and Eric S Raymond and discussed by hundreds of volunteers in an open community discussion     Balloon Open Hardware License used by all projects in the Balloon Project Although originally a software license OpenCores encourages the LGPL Hardware Design Public License written by Graham Seaman admin of Opencollector org In March   CERN released the CERN Open Hardware License OHL   intended for use with the Open Hardware Repository   and other projects The Solderpad License   is a version of the Apache License version     amended by lawyer Andrew Katz to render it more appropriate for hardware use The Open Source Hardware Association recommends seven licenses which follow their open-source hardware definition   From the general copyleft licenses the GNU General Public License GPL and Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license from the HW specific copyleft licenses the CERN Open Hardware License OHL and TAPR Open Hardware License OHL and from the permissive licenses the FreeBSD license the MIT license and the Creative Commons Attribution license   Openhardware org recommended in   the TAPR Open Hardware License Creative Commons BY-SA     and GPL     license   Organizations tend to rally around a shared license For example OpenCores prefers the LGPL or a Modified BSD License   FreeCores insists on the GPL   Open Hardware Foundation promotes \" copyleft or other permissive licenses\"   the Open Graphics Project us   es a variety of licenses including the MIT license GPL and a proprietary license   and the Balloon Project wrote their own license   Development edit The OSHW Open Source Hardware logo silkscreened on an unpopulated PCB The adjective \"open-source\" not only refers to a specific set of freedoms applying to a product but also generally presupposes that the product is the object or the result of a \"process that relies on the contributions of geographically dispersed developers via the Internet \"   In practice however in both fields of open-source hardware and open-source software products may either be the result of a development process performed by a closed team in a private setting or by a community in a public environment the first case being more frequent than the second which is more challenging   Establishing a community-based product development process faces several challenges such as to find appropriate product data management tools document not only the product but also the development process itself accepting losing ubiquitous control over the project ensure continuity in a context of fickle participation of voluntary project members among others   The Arduino Diecimila another popular and early open source hardware design One of the major differences between developing open-source software and developing open-source hardware is that hardware results in tangible outputs which cost money to prototype and manufacture As a result the phrase \"free as in speech not as in beer\"   more formally known as Gratis versus Libre distinguishes between the idea of zero cost and the freedom to use and modify information While open-source hardware faces challenges in minimizing cost and reducing financial risks for individual project developers some community members have proposed models to address these needs   Given this there are initiatives to develop sustainable community funding mechanisms such as the Open Source Hardware Central Bank Extensive discussion has taken place on ways to make open-source hardware as accessible as open-source software Providing clear and detailed product documentation is an essential factor facilitating product replication and collaboration in hardware development projects Practical guides have been developed to help practitioners to do so     Another option is to design products so they are easy to replicate as exemplified in the concept of open-source appropriate technology   The process of developing open-source hardware in a community-based setting is alternatively called open design open source development   or open source product development   All these terms are instantiations of the open-source model applicable for the development of any product may it be software hardware cultural educational and so on See here for a delineation of these terms A major contributor to the production of open-source hardware product designs is the scientific community There has been considerable work to produce open-source hardware for scientific hardware using a combination of open-source electronics and 3-D printing       Other sources of open-source hardware production are vendors of chips and other electronic components sponsoring contests with the provision that the participants and winners must share their designs Circuit Cellar magazine organizes some of these contests Open-source labs edit A guide has been published Open-Source Lab book by Joshua Pearce on using open-source electronics and 3D printing to make open-source labs Today scientists are creating many such labs examples include Boston Open Source Science Laboratory Somerville Massachusetts BYU Open Source Lab Brigham Young University Michigan Tech   National Tsing Hua University   OSU Open Source Lab Oregon State University Open Source Research Lab University of Texas at El Paso Business models edit Open hardware companies are experimenting with different business models   In one example littleBits implements open-source business models by making the design files available for the circuit designs in each littleBits module in accordance with the CERN Open Hardware License Version       In another example Arduino has registered its name as a trademark Others may manufacture their designs but can't put the Arduino name on them Thus they can distinguish their products from others by appellation   There are many applicable business models for implementing some open-source hardware even in traditional firms For example to accelerate development and technical innovation the photovoltaic industry has experimented with partnerships franchises secondary supplier and completely open-source models   Recently many open source hardware projects were funded via crowdfunding on Indiegogo or Kickstarter Especially popular is Crowd Supply for crowdfunding open hardware projects   Reception and impact edit Cover for \" Open-Source Lab \" by Joshua M Pearce   Richard Stallman the founder of the free software movement was in   skeptical on the idea and relevance of Free hardware his terminology for what is now known as open-source hardware   In a   Wired article he adapted his point of view slightly while he still sees no ethical parallel between free software and free hardware he acknowledges the importance   Also Stallman uses and suggests the term free hardware design over open source hardware a request which is consistent with his earlier rejection of the term open source software see also Alternative terms for free software   Other authors such as Joshua Pearce have argued there is an ethical imperative for open-source hardware specifically with respect to open-source appropriate technology for sustainable development   In   he also wrote the book Open-Source Lab How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs which details the development of free and open-source hardware primarily for scientists and university faculty     Find open-source hardware products edit Some ongoing initiatives provide indexes of open-source hardware products for different purposes The Open Source Hardware Association provides a certification programme and maintains a directory of certified products The Observatory of Open Source Hardware aims at supporting exchange of best practices between practitioners It maintains an open access and curated directory of open source hardware products rated according to their degree of openness This directory contains references of more than   complex open source hardware products The P2P Foundation maintains an Open Hardware Directory as well See also some specific lists in Wikipedia List of open-source hardware projects Open-source computing

use AT free of concerns about patents At the same time anyone can also add to the collective open-source knowledge base by contributing ideas observations experimental data deployment logs etc It has been claimed that the potential for open-source-appropriate technology to drive applied sustainability is enormous   The built in continuous peer-review can result in better quality higher reliability and more flexibility than conventional design/patenting of technologies The free nature of the knowledge also obviously provides lower costs particularly for those technologies that do not benefit to a large degree from scale of manufacture Finally OSAT also enables the end to predatory intellectual property lock-in This is particularly important in the context of technology focused on relieving suffering and saving lives in the developing world The \"open-source\" model can act as a driver of sustainable development There are at least three good reasons   It enables production as well as consumption It enables localization for communities that do not have the resources to tempt commercial developers to provide local versions of their products It can be free as in \"gratis\" as well as free as in \"libre\" an important consideration for developing communities   following the lateral scaling concepts of Jeremy Rifkin   Ethical considerations edit For solutions many researchers companies and academics do work on products meant to assist sustainable development Vinay Gupta has suggested that those developers agree to three principles   I will not permit any human being to be deprived of life-giving technology by the profit motive Any works that I patent I will make available to others who are engaged in humanitarian activity for free except where this would breach other contractual responsibilities I will not use patent law to slow the pace of innovation or service delivery to the needy under any circumstances The ethics of information sharing in this context has been explored in depth     Support in the literature edit It has been investigated how open sharing of designs specifications and technical information can enhance effectiveness widespread use and innovation of appropriate technology   OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for sustainable development   OSAT has been claimed to assist in development of medical technology particularly for the developing world       It has been claimed that the sharing of design processes appropriate tools and technical information enables more effective and rapid development of appropriate technologies for both industrialized and non-industrialized regions   In addition it is claimed that this sharing will require the appropriate-technology community to adopt open standards/licenses document knowledge and build on previous work   OSAT can be used to generate renewable energy   OSAT in ICT   OSAT and peer production   In education edit At the university level the use of open-source-appropriate technology classroom projects has been shown to be successful in forging the connection between physics and social benefit   This approach has the potential to use university students' access to resources and testing equipment in furthering the development of appropriate technology Similarly OSAT has been used as a tool for improving service learning     MIT has completed a study looking at the usefulness of using appropriate technology education and its relation to OSAT   It has been proposed that the evolution of the open-source 3D printers can enable a new

peer production     navigation search For a broader coverage related to this topic see Peer production Commons-based peer production CBPP is a term coined by Harvard Law School professor Yochai Benkler   It describes a new model of socioeconomic production in which large numbers of people work cooperatively usually over the Internet Commons -based projects generally have less rigid hierarchical structures than those under more traditional business models Often but not always commons-based projects are designed without a need for financial compensation for contributors For example sharing of STL file format design files for objects freely on the internet enables anyone with a 3-D printer to digitally replicate distributed manufacture the object     saving the prosumer significant money     The term is often used interchangeably with the term social production Contents   Overview   Principles   Examples   Outgrowths   Related concepts   Criticism       References     Overview edit The history of commons-based peer production communities by the P2Pvalue project Benkler contrasts commons -based peer production with firm production in which tasks are delegated based on a central decision-making process and market-based production in which allocating different prices to different tasks serves as an incentive to anyone interested in performing a task Benkler first introduced the term in his   paper \"Coase's Penguin or Linux and the Nature of the Firm\"   whose title refers to the Linux mascot and to Ronald Coase who originated the transaction costs theory of the firm that provides the methodological template for the paper's analysis of peer production The paper cites Eben Moglen as the originator of the concept   In his book The Wealth of Networks   Benkler significantly expands on his definition of commons-based peer production According to Benkler what distinguishes commons-based production is that it doesn't rely upon or propagate proprietary knowledge \"The inputs and outputs of the process are shared freely or conditionally in an institutional form that leaves them equally available for all to use as they choose at their individual discretion \" To ensure that the knowledge generated is available for free use commons-based projects are often shared under an open license Not all commons-based production necessarily qualifies as commons-based peer production According to Benkler peer production is defined not only by the openness of its outputs but also by a decentralized participant-driven working method of working   Peer production enterprises have two primary advantages over traditional hierarchical approaches to production Information gain Peer production allows individuals to self-assign tasks that suit their own skills expertise and interests Contributors can generate dynamic content that reflects the individual skills and the \"variability of human creativity \" Great variability of human and information resources leads to substantial increasing returns to scale to the number of people and resources and projects that may be accomplished without need for a contract or other factor permitting the proper use of the resource for a project   In Wikinomics Don Tapscott and Anthony D Williams suggest an incentive mechanism behind common-based peer production \"People participate in peer production communities \" they write \"for a wide range of intrinsic and self-interested reasons basically people who participate in peer production communities love it They feel passionate about their particular area of expertise and revel in creating something new or better \"   Aaron Krowne offers another definition commons-based peer production refers to any coordinated chiefly internet-based effort whereby volunteers contribute project components and there exists some process to combine them to produce a unified intellectual work CBPP covers many different types of intellectual output from software to libraries of quantitative data to human-readable documents manuals books encyclopedias reviews blogs periodicals and more   Principles edit First the potential goals of peer production must be modular In other words objectives must be divisible into components or modules each of which can be independently produced That allows participants to work asynchronously without having to wait for each other's contributions or coordinate with each other in person   Second the granularity of the modules is essential Granularity refers to the degree to which objects are broken down into smaller pieces module size   Different levels of granularity will allow people with different levels of motivation to work together by contributing small or large grained modules consistent with their level of interest in the project and their motivation   Third a successful peer-production enterprise must have low-cost integration the mechanism by which the modules are integrated into a whole end product Thus integration must include both quality controls over the modules and a mechanism for integrating the contributions into the finished product at relatively low cost   Examples edit Additional examples of commons-based peer production communities by the P2Pvalue project One day living with commons-based peer production communities by the P2Pvalue project Examples of projects using commons-based peer production include Linux a computer operating system kernel GNU a computer operating system generally used in conjunction with the kernel Linux Slashdot a news and announcements website Wikipedia an online encyclopedia Distributed Proofreaders which proof reads public domain etexts for publication on Project Gutenberg SETI@home a project which searches for extra

degrowth education network producing open materials and curricula Community Garden where people work together to grow things and then share the fruits of their labor Outgrowths edit Several outgrowths have been Customization/Specialization With free and open source software small groups have the capability to customize a large project according to specific needs With the rise of low-cost 3-D printing and other digital manufacturing techniques this is now also becoming true of open source hardware Longevity Once code is released under a copyleft free software license it is almost impossible to remove it from the public domain Cross-fertilization Experts in a field can work on more than one project with no legal hassles Technology Revisions A core technology gives rise to new implementations of existing projects Technology Clustering Groups of products tend to cluster around a core set of technology and integrate with one another Related concepts edit   Open-source model Interrelated concepts to Commons-based peer production are the processes of peer governance and peer property To begin with peer governance is a new mode of governance and bottom-up mode of participative decision-making that is being experimented in peer projects such as Wikipedia and FLOSS thus peer governance is the way that peer production the process in which common value is produced is managed   Peer Property indicates the innovative nature of legal forms such as the General Public License the Creative Commons etc Whereas traditional forms of property are exclusionary \"if it is mine it is not yours\" peer property forms are inclusionary It is from all of us i e also for you provided you respect the basic rules laid out in the license such as the openness of the source code for example   The ease of entering and leaving an organization is a feature of adhocracies The principle of commons-based peer production is similar to collective invention a model of open innovation in economics coined by Robert Allen   Also related Open-source economics and Commercial use of copyleft works Criticism edit Some   believe that the commons-based peer production CBPP vision while powerful and groundbreaking needs to be strengthened at its root because of some allegedly wrong assumptions concerning free and open source software FOSS The CBPP literature regularly and explicitly quotes FOSS products as examples of artifacts emerging by virtue of mere cooperation with no need for supervising leadership without market signals or managerial commands in Benkler s words It can be argued however that in the development of any less than trivial piece of software irrespective of whether it be FOSS or proprietary a subset of the many participants always play -explicitly and deliberately- the role of leading system and subsystem designers determining architecture and functionality while most of the people work underneath them in a logical functional sense     edit

has various rights to use associated with it and may also have various properties of how it was designed e g open process There is no single definition and interpretations vary with usage The terms open and standard have a wide range of meanings associated with their usage There are a number of definitions of open standards which emphasize different aspects of openness including the openness of the resulting specification the openness of the drafting process and the ownership of rights in the standard The term \"standard\" is sometimes restricted to technologies approved by formalized committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate on a consensus basis The definitions of the term open standard used by academics the European Union and some of its member governments or parliaments such as Denmark France and Spain preclude open standards requiring fees for use as do the New Zealand South African and the Venezuelan governments On the standard organisation side the World Wide Web Consortium W3C ensures that its specifications can be implemented on a royalty-free basis Many definitions of the term standard permit patent holders to impose \"reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing\" royalty fees and other licensing terms on implementers or users of the standard For example the rules for standards published by the major internationally recognized standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF International Organization for Standardization ISO International Electrotechnical Commission IEC and ITU-T permit their standards to contain specifications whose implementation will require payment of patent licensing fees Among these organizations only the IETF and ITU-T explicitly refer to their standards as \"open standards\" while the others refer only to producing \"standards\" The IETF and ITU-T use definitions of \"open standard\" that allow \"reasonable and non-discriminatory\" patent licensing fee requirements There are those in the open-source software community who hold that an \"open standard\" is only open if it can be freely adopted implemented and extended   While open standards or architectures are considered non-proprietary in the sense that the standard is either unowned or owned by a collective body it can still be publicly shared and not tightly guarded   The typical example of open source that has become a standard is the personal computer originated by IBM and now referred to as Wintel the combination of the Microsoft operating system and Intel microprocessor There are three others that are most widely accepted as open which include the GSM phones adopted as a government standard Open Group which promotes UNIX and the like and the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF which created the first standards of SMTP and TCP/IP Buyers tend to prefer open standards which they believe offer them cheaper products and more choice for access due to network effects and increased competition between vendors   Open standards which specify formats are sometimes referred to as open formats Many specifications that are sometimes referred to as standards are proprietary and only available under restrictive contract terms if they can be obtained at all from the organization that owns the copyright on the specification As such these specifications are not considered to be fully open Joel West has argued that \"open\" standards are not black and white but have many different levels of \"openness\" Ultimately a standard needs according to whom? to be open enough that it will become adopted and accepted in the market but still closed enough that firms can get a return on their investment in developing the technology around the standard A more open standard tends to occur when the knowledge of the technology becomes dispersed enough that competition is increased and others are able to start copying the technology as they implement it This occurred with the Wintel architecture as others were able to start imitating the software Less open standards exist when a particular firm has much power not ownership over the standard which can occur when a firm s platform wins in standard setting or the market makes one platform most popular   Contents   Specific definitions of an open standard     Joint IEEE ISOC W3C

Engineers IEEE Internet Society ISOC World Wide Web Consortium W3C Internet Engineering Task Force IETF and Internet Architecture Board IAB jointly affirmed a set of principles which have contributed to the exponential growth of the Internet and related technologies The OpenStand Principles define open standards and establish the building blocks for innovation Standards developed using the OpenStand principles are developed through an open participatory process support interoperability foster global competition are voluntarily adopted on a global level and serve as building blocks for products and services targeted to meet the needs of markets and consumers This drives innovation which in turn contributes to the creation of new markets and the growth and expansion of existing markets There are five key OpenStand Principles as outlined below   Cooperation Respectful cooperation between standards organizations whereby each respects the autonomy integrity processes and intellectual property rules of the others   Adherence to Principles - Adherence to the five fundamental principles of standards development namely Due process Decisions are made with equity and fairness among participants No one party dominates or guides standards development Standards processes are transparent and opportunities exist to appeal decisions Processes for periodic standards review and updating are well defined Broad consensus Processes allow for all views to be considered and addressed such that agreement can be found across a range of interests Transparency Standards organizations provide advance public notice of proposed standards development activities the scope of work to be undertaken and conditions for participation Easily accessible records of decisions and the materials used in reaching those decisions are provided Public comment periods are provided before final standards approval and adoption Balance Standards activities are not exclusively dominated by any particular person company or interest group Openness Standards processes are open to all interested and informed parties   Collective Empowerment Commitment by affirming standards organizations and their participants to collective empowerment by striving for standards that are chosen and defined based on technical merit as judged by the contributed expertise of each participant provide global interoperability scalability stability and resiliency enable global competition serve as building blocks for further innovation and contribute to the creation of global communities benefiting humanity   Availability Standards specifications are made accessible to all for implementation and deployment Affirming standards organizations have defined procedures to develop specifications that can be implemented under fair terms Given market diversity fair terms may vary from royalty-free to fair reasonable and non-discriminatory terms FRAND   Voluntary Adoption Standards are voluntarily adopted and success is determined by the market   ITU-T definition edit The ITU-T is a standards development organization SDO that is one of the three sectors of the International Telecommunications Union a specialized agency of the United Nations The ITU-T has a Telecommunication Standardization Bureau director's Ad Hoc group on IPR that produced the following definition in March   which the ITU-T as a whole has endorsed for its purposes since November     The ITU-T has a long history of open standards development However recently some different external sources have attempted to define the term \"Open Standard\" in a variety of different ways In order to avoid confusion the ITU-T uses for its purpose the term \"Open Standards\" per the following definition \"Open Standards\" are standards made available to the general public and are developed or approved and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process \"Open Standards\" facilitate interoperability and data exchange among different products or services and are intended for widespread adoption Other elements of \"Open Standards\" include but are not limited to Collaborative process voluntary and market driven development or approval following a transparent consensus driven process that is reasonably open to all interested parties Reasonably balanced ensures that the process is not dominated by any one interest group Due process - includes consideration of and response to comments by interested parties Intellectual property rights IPRs IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide non-discriminatory basis either   for free and under other reasonable terms and conditions or   on reasonable terms and conditions which may include monetary compensation Negotiations are left to the parties concerned and are performed outside the SDO Quality and level of detail sufficient to permit the development of a variety of competing implementations of interoperable products or services Standardized interfaces are not hidden or controlled other than by the SDO promulgating the standard Publicly available easily available for implementation and use at a reasonable price Publication of the text of a standard by others is permitted only with the prior approval of the SDO On-going support maintained and supported over a long period of time The ITU-T ITU-R ISO and IEC have harmonized on a common patent policy   under the banner of the WSC However the ITU-T definition should not necessarily be considered also applicable in ITU-R ISO and IEC contexts since the Common Patent Policy   does not make any reference to \"open standards\" but rather only to \"standards \" IETF definition edit In section   of its RFC   the IETF classifies specifications that have been developed in a manner similar to that of the IETF itself as being \"open standards \" and lists the standards produced by ANSI ISO IEEE and ITU-T as examples As the IETF standardization processes and IPR policies have the characteristics listed above by ITU-T the IETF standards fulfill the ITU-T definition of \"open standards \" However the IETF has not adopted a specific definition of \"open standard\" both RFC   and the IETF's mission statement RFC   talks about \"open process \" but RFC   does not define \"open standard\" except for the purpose of defining what documents IETF standards can link to RFC   belongs to a set of RFCs collectively known as BCP   Best Common Practice an IETF policy   RFC   was later updated by BCP   and   among others As of   BCP   is RFC   Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust   and BCP   consists of RFC   Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology and a clarification in RFC     The changes are intended to be compatible with the \"Simplified BSD License\" as stated in the IETF Trust Legal Provisions and Copyright FAQ based on RFC     In August   the IETF combined with the W3C and IEEE to launch OpenStand   and to publish The Modern Paradigm for Standards This captures \"the effective and efficient standardization processes that have made the Internet and Web the premiere platforms for innovation and borderless commerce\" The declaration is then published in the form of RFC   in January   European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services edit The European Union defined the term for use within its European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services Version       although it does not claim to be a universal definition for all European Union use and documentation To reach interoperability in the context of pan-European eGovernment services guidance needs to focus on open standards The word \"open\" is here meant in the sense of fulfilling the following requirements The standard is adopted and will be maintained by a not-for-profit organization and its ongoing development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure available to all interested parties consensus or majority decision etc The standard has been published and the standard specification document is available either freely or at a nominal charge It must be permissible to all to copy distribute and use it for no fee or at a nominal fee The intellectual property - i e patents possibly present - of parts of the standard is made irrevocably available on a royalty-free basis There are no constraints on the re-use of the standard   Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium definition edit The Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium NCOIC defines open standard as the following Specifications for hardware and/or software that are publicly available implying that multiple vendors can compete directly based on the features and performance of their products It also implies that the existing open system can be removed and replaced with that of another vendor with minimal effort and without major interruption   Danish government definition edit The Danish government has attempted to make a definition of open standards   which also is used in pan-European software development projects It states An open standard is accessible to everyone free of charge i e there is no discrimination between users and no payment or other considerations are required as a condition of use of the standard An open standard of necessity remains accessible and free of charge i e owners renounce their options if indeed such exist to limit access to the standard at a later date for example by committing themselves to openness during the remainder of a possible patent's life An open standard is accessible free of charge and documented in all its details i e all aspects of the standard are transparent and documented and both access to and use of the documentation is free French law definition edit The French Parliament approved a definition of \"open standard\" in its \"Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy \"   The definition is   By open standard is understood any communication interconnection or interchange protocol and any interoperable data format whose specifications are public and without any restriction in their access or implementation Indian Government Definition edit A clear Royalty Free stance and far reaching requirements case is the one for India's Government       Mandatory Characteristics An Identified Standard will qualify as an Open Standard if it meets the following criteria       Specification document of the Identified Standard shall be available with or without a nominal fee       The Patent claims necessary to implement the Identified Standard shall be made available on a Royalty-Free basis for the lifetime of the Standard       Identified Standard shall be adopted and maintained by a not-for-profit organization wherein all stakeholders can opt to participate in a transparent collaborative and consensual manner       Identified Standard shall be recursively open as far as possible       Identified Standard shall have technology-neutral specification       Identified Standard shall be capable of localization support where applicable for all Indian official Languages for all applicable domains Italian Law definition edit Italy has a general rule for the entire public sector dealing with Open Standards although concentrating on data formats in Art   of the Code of the Digital Administration Codice dell'Amministrazione Digitale   applications must allow representation of data under different formats at least one being an open data format it is defined an open data format a data format which is made public is thoroughly documented and neutral with regard to the technological tools needed to peruse the same data Spanish law definition edit A Law passed by the Spanish Parliament   requires that all electronic services provided by the Spanish public administration must be based on open standards It defines an open standard as royalty free according to the following definition   An open standard fulfills the following conditions it is public and its use is available on a free gratis basis or at a cost that does not imply a difficulty for the user its use is not subject to the payment of any intellectual copyright or industrial patents and trademarks property right Venezuelan law definition edit The Venezuelan Government approved a \"free software and open standards law \"   The decree includes the requirement that the Venezuelan public sector must use free software based on open standards and includes a definition of open standard   Article   for the purposes of this Decree it shall be understood as k Open standards technical specifications published and controlled by an organization in charge of their development that have been accepted by the industry available to everybody for their implementation in free software or other type of software promoting competitivity interoperability and flexibility South African Government definition edit The South African Government approved a definition in the \"Minimum Interoperability Operating Standards Handbook\" MIOS   For the purposes of the MIOS a standard shall be considered open if it meets all of these criteria There are standards which we are obliged to adopt for pragmatic reasons which do not necessarily fully conform to being open in all respects In such cases where an open standard does not yet exist the degree of openness will be taken into account when selecting an appropriate standard it should be maintained by a non-commercial organization participation in the ongoing development work is based on decision making processes that are open to all interested parties open access all may access committee documents drafts and completed standards free of cost or for a negligible fee It must be possible for everyone to copy distribute and use the standard free of cost The intellectual rights required to implement the standard e g essential patent claims are irrevocably available without any royalties attached There are no reservations regarding reuse of the standard There are multiple implementations of the standard New Zealand official interoperability framework definition edit The E-Government Interoperability Framework e-GIF   defines open standard as royalty free according to the following text While a universally agreed definition of \"open standards\" is unlikely to be resolved in the near future the e-GIF accepts that a definition of open standards needs to recognise a continuum that ranges from closed to open and encompasses varying degrees of \"openness \" To guide readers in this respect the e-GIF endorses \"open standards\" that exhibit the following properties Be accessible to everyone free of charge no discrimination between users and no payment or other considerations should be required as a condition to use the standard Remain accessible to everyone free of charge owners should renounce their options if any to limit access to the standard at a later date Be documented in all its details all aspects of the standard should be transparent and documented and both access to and use of the documentation should be free The e-GIF performs the same function in e-government as the Road Code does on the highways Driving would be excessively costly inefficient and ineffective if road rules had to be agreed each time one vehicle encountered another Bruce Perens' definition edit One of the most popular definitions of the term \"open standard \" as measured by Google ranking is the one developed by Bruce Perens   His definition lists a set of principles that he believes must be met by an open standard Availability Open Standards are available for all to read and implement Maximize End-User Choice Open Standards create a fair competitive market for implementations of the standard They do not lock the customer into a particular vendor or group No Royalty Open Standards are free for all to implement with no royalty or fee Certification of compliance by the standards organization may involve a fee No Discrimination Open Standards and the organizations that administer them do not favor one implementor over another for any reason other than the technical standards compliance of a vendor s implementation Certification organizations must provide a path for low and zero-cost implementations to be validated but may also provide enhanced certification services Extension or Subset Implementations of Open Standards may be extended or offered in subset form However certification organizations may decline to certify subset implementations and may place requirements upon extensions see Predatory Practices Predatory Practices Open Standards may employ license terms that protect against subversion of the standard by embrace-and-extend tactics The licenses attached to the standard may require the publication of reference information for extensions and a license for all others to create distribute and sell software that is compatible with the extensions An Open Standard may not otherwise prohibit extensions Microsoft's definition edit Vijay Kapoor national technology officer Microsoft defines what open standards are as follows   Let's look at what an open standard means 'open' refers to it being royalty-free while 'standard' means a technology approved by formalized committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate on a consensus basis An open standard is publicly available and developed approved and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process Overall Microsoft's relationship to open standards was at best mixed While Microsoft participated in the most significant standard-setting organizations that establish open standards it was often seen as oppositional to their adoption   Open Source Initiative's definition edit The Open Source Initiative defines the requirements and criteria for open standards as follows   The Requirement An \"open standard\" must not prohibit conforming implementations in open source software The Criteria To comply with the Open Standards Requirement an \"open standard\" must satisfy the following criteria If an \"open standard\" does not meet these criteria it will be discriminating against open source developers No Intentional Secrets The standard MUST NOT withhold any detail necessary for interoperable implementation As flaws are inevitable the standard MUST define a process for fixing flaws identified during implementation and interoperability testing and to incorporate said changes into a revised version or superseding version of the standard to be released under terms that do not violate the OSR Availability The standard MUST be freely and publicly available e g from a stable web site under royalty-free terms at reasonable and non-discriminatory cost Patents All patents essential to implementation of the standard MUST be licensed under royalty-free terms for unrestricted use or be covered by a promise of non-assertion when practiced by open source software No Agreements There MUST NOT be any requirement for execution of a license agreement NDA grant click-through or any other form of paperwork to deploy conforming implementations of the standard No OSR-Incompatible Dependencies Implementation of the standard MUST NOT require any other technology that fails to meet the criteria of this Requirement Ken Krechmer's definition edit Ken Krechmer   identifies ten \"rights\" Open Meeting Consensus Due Process Open IPR One World Open Change Open Documents Open Interface Open Use On-going Support World Wide Web Consortium's definition edit As an important provider of Web technology ICT Standards notably XML http HTML CSS and WAI the World Wide Web Consortium W3C follows a process that promotes the development of high-quality standards   Looking at the end result the spec alone up for adoption is not enough The participative/inclusive process leading to a particular design and the supporting resources available with it should be accounted when we talk about Open Standards transparency due process is public and all technical discussions meeting minutes are archived and referencable in decision making relevance new standardization is started upon due analysis of the market needs including requirements phase e g accessibility multi-linguism openness anybody can participate and everybody does industry individual public government bodies academia on a worldwide scale impartiality and consensus guaranteed fairness by the process and the neutral hosting of the W3C organization with equal weight for each participant availability free access to the standard text both during development at final stage and for translations and assurance that core Web and Internet technologies can be implemented Royalty-Free maintenance ongoing process for testing errata revision permanent access validation etc In August   the W3C combined with the IETF and IEEE to launch OpenStand   and to publish The Modern Paradigm for Standards This captures \"the effective and efficient standardization processes that have made the Internet and Web the premiere platforms for innovation and borderless commerce\" Digital Standards Organization definition edit The Digital Standards Organization DIGISTAN states that \"an open standard must be aimed at creating unrestricted competition between vendors and unrestricted choice for users \"   Its brief definition of \"open standard\" or \"free and open standard\" is \"a published specification that is immune to vendor capture at all stages in its life-cycle \" Its more complete definition as follows \"The standard is adopted and will be maintained by a not-for-profit organization and its ongoing development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure available to all interested parties The standard has been published and the standard specification document is available freely It must be permissible to all to copy distribute and use it freely The patents possibly present on parts of the standard are made irrevocably available on a royalty-free basis There are no constraints on the re-use of the standard A key defining property is that an open standard is immune to vendor capture at all stages in its life-cycle Immunity from vendor capture makes it possible to improve upon trust and extend an open standard over time \"   This definition is based on the EU's EIF v1 definition of \"open standard \" but with changes to address what it terms as \"vendor capture \" They believe that \"Many groups and individuals have provided definitions for 'open standard' that reflect their economic interests in the standards process We see that the fundamental conflict is between vendors who seek to capture markets and raise costs and the market at large which seeks freedom and lower costs Vendors work hard to turn open standards into franchise standards They work to change the statutory language so they can cloak franchise standards in the sheep's clothing of 'open standard ' A robust definition of \"free and open standard\" must thus take into account the direct economic conflict between vendors and the market at large \"   Free Software Foundation Europe's definition edit The Free Software Foundation Europe FSFE uses a definition which is based on the European Interoperability Framework v   and was extended after consultation with industry and community stakeholders FSFE's standard has been adopted by groups such as the SELF EU Project the   Geneva Declaration on Standards and the Future of the Internet and international Document Freedom Day teams According to this definition an Open Standard is a format or protocol that is Subject to full public assessment and use without constraints in a manner equally available to all parties Without any components or extensions that have dependencies on formats or protocols that do not meet the definition of an Open Standard themselves Free from legal or technical clauses that limit its utilisation by any party or in any business model Managed and further developed independently of any single vendor in a process open to the equal participation of competitors and third parties Available in multiple complete implementations by competing vendors or as a complete implementation equally available to all parties FFII's definition edit The Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure 's definition is said by whom? to coincide with the definition issued in the European Interoperability Framework released in   A specification that is public the standard is inclusive and it has been developed and is maintained in an open standardization process everybody can implement it without any restriction neither payment to license the IPR granted to everybody for free and without any condition This is the minimum license terms asked by standardization bodies as W3C Of course all the other bodies accept open standards But specification itself could cost a fair amount of money ie 100-400Eur per copy as in ISO because copyright and publication of the document itself UK government definition edit The UK government's definition of open standards applies to software interoperability data and document formats The criteria for open standards are published in the Open Standards Principles policy paper and are as follows Collaboration - the standard is maintained through a collaborative decision-making process that is consensus based and independent of any individual supplier Involvement in the development and maintenance of the standard is accessible to all interested parties Transparency - the decision-making process is transparent and a publicly accessible review by subject matter experts is part of the process Due process - the standard is adopted by a specification or standardisation organisation or a forum or consortium with a feedback and ratification process to ensure quality Fair access - the standard is published thoroughly documented and publicly available at zero or low cost Zero cost is preferred but this should be considered on a case by case basis as part of the selection process Cost should not be prohibitive or likely to cause a barrier to a level playing field Market support - other than in the context of creating innovative solutions the standard is mature supported by the market and demonstrates platform application and vendor independence Rights - rights

reasonable and non-discriminatory RAND licensing for the use of patented technology in web standards increased Bruce Perens important associations as FSF or FFII and others have argued that the use of patents restricts who can implement a standard to those able or willing to pay for the use of the patented technology The requirement to pay some small amount per user is often an insurmountable problem for free/open source software implementations which can be redistributed by anyone Royalty free RF licensing is generally the only possible license for free/open source software implementations Version   of the GNU General Public License includes a section that enjoins anyone who distributes a program released under the GPL from enforcing patents on subsequent users of the software or derivative works One result of this controversy was that many governments including the Danish French and Spanish governments singly and the EU collectively specifically affirmed that \"open standards\" required royalty-free licenses Some standards organizations such as the W3C modified their processes to essentially only permit royalty-free licensing Patents for software formulas and algorithms are currently enforceable in the US but not in the EU The European Patent Convention Article   paragraph   c expressly prohibits algorithms business methods and software from being covered by patents The US has only allowed them since   and there has been growing controversy in recent years as to either the benefit or feasibility A standards body and its associated processes cannot force a patent holder to give up its right to charge license fees especially if the company concerned is not a member of the standards body and unconstrained by any rules that were set during the standards development process In fact this element discourages some standards bodies from adopting an \"open\" approach fearing that they will lose out if their members are more constrained than non-members Few bodies will carry out or require their members to carry out a full patent search Ultimately the only sanctions a standards body can apply on a non-member when patent licensing is demanded is to cancel the standard try to rework around it or work to invalidate the patent Standards bodies such as W3C and OASIS require citation needed that the use of required patents be granted under a royalty-free license as a condition for joining the body or a particular working group and this is generally considered enforceable citation needed Examples of patent claims brought against standards previously thought to be open include JPEG and the Rambus case over DDR SDRAM The H   video codec is an example of a standards organization producing a standard that has known non-royalty-free required patents Often the scope of the standard itself determines how likely it is that a firm will be able to use a standard as patent-like protection Richard Langlois argues that standards with a wide scope may offer a firm some level of protection from competitors but it is likely that Schumpeterian creative destruction will ultimately leave the firm open to being \"invented around\" regardless of the standard a firm may benefit from   Quotes edit EU Commissioner Erkki Liikanen \"Open standards are important to help create interoperable and affordable solutions for everybody They also promote competition by setting up a technical playing field that is level to all market players This means lower costs for enterprises and ultimately the consumer \" World Standards Day   October     Jorma Ollila Chairman of Nokia's Board of Directors \" Open standards and platforms create a foundation for success They enable interoperability of technologies and

navigation search \"CAD\" and \"CADD\" redirect here For other uses see CAD disambiguation and CADD disambiguation Example 2D CAD drawing Example 3D CAD model Computer-aided design CAD is the use of computer systems or workstations to aid in the creation modification analysis or optimization of a design   CAD software is used to increase the productivity of the designer improve the quality of design improve communications through documentation and to create a database for manufacturing   CAD output is often in the form of electronic files for print machining or other manufacturing operations The term CADD for Computer Aided Design and Drafting is also used   Its use in designing electronic systems is known as electronic design automation or EDA In mechanical design it is known as mechanical design automation MDA or computer-aided drafting CAD which includes the process of creating a technical drawing with the use of computer software   CAD software for mechanical design uses either vector-based graphics to depict the objects of traditional drafting or may also produce raster graphics showing the overall appearance of designed objects However it involves more than just shapes As in the manual drafting of technical and engineering drawings the output of CAD must convey information such as materials processes dimensions and tolerances according to application-specific conventions CAD may be used to design curves and figures in two-dimensional 2D space or curves surfaces and solids in three-dimensional 3D space   CAD is an important industrial art extensively used in many applications including automotive shipbuilding and aerospace industries industrial and architectural design prosthetics and many more CAD is also widely used to produce computer animation for special effects in movies advertising and technical manuals often called DCC digital content creation The modern ubiquity and power of computers means that even perfume bottles and shampoo dispensers are designed using techniques unheard of by engineers of the 1960s Because of its enormous economic importance CAD has been a major driving force for research in computational geometry computer graphics both hardware and software and discrete differential geometry   The design of geometric models for object shapes in particular is occasionally called computer-aided geometric design CAGD   Contents   Overview of CAD software   Uses   Types   Technology   Software   History       References     Overview of CAD software edit Starting around the mid 1960s with the IBM Drafting System computer-aided design systems began to provide more capability than just an ability to reproduce manual drafting with electronic drafting the cost-benefit for companies to switch to CAD became apparent The benefits of CAD systems over manual drafting are the capabilities one often takes for granted from computer systems today automated generation of Bill of Material auto layout in integrated circuits interference checking and many others Eventually CAD provided the designer with the ability to perform engineering calculations During this transition calculations were still performed either by hand or by those individuals who could run computer programs CAD was a revolutionary change in the engineering industry where draftsmen designers and engineering roles begin to merge It did not eliminate departments as much as it merged departments and empowered draftsman designers and engineers CAD is just another example of the pervasive effect computers were beginning to have on industry Current computer-aided design software packages range from 2D vector -based drafting systems to 3D solid and surface modelers Modern CAD packages can also frequently allow rotations in three dimensions allowing viewing of a designed object from any desired angle even from the inside looking out Some CAD software is capable of dynamic mathematical modeling CAD technology is used in the design of tools and machinery and in the drafting and design of all types of buildings from small residential types houses to the largest commercial and industrial structures hospitals and factories   CAD is mainly used for detailed engineering of 3D models or 2D drawings of physical components but it is also used throughout the engineering process from conceptual design and layout of products through strength and dynamic analysis of assemblies to definition of manufacturing methods of components It can also be used to design objects such as jewelry furniture appliances etc Furthermore many CAD applications now offer advanced rendering and animation capabilities so engineers can better visualize their product designs 4D BIM is a type of virtual construction engineering simulation incorporating time or schedule related information for project management CAD has become an especially important technology within the scope of computer-aided technologies with benefits such as lower product development costs and a greatly shortened design cycle CAD enables designers to layout and develop work on screen print it out and save it for future editing saving time on their drawings Uses edit Computer-aided design is one of the many tools used by engineers and designers and is used in many ways depending on the profession of the user and the type of software in question CAD is one part of the whole Digital Product Development DPD activity within the Product Lifecycle Management PLM processes and as such is used together with other tools which are either integrated modules or stand-alone products such as Computer-aided engineering CAE and Finite element analysis FEA Computer-aided manufacturing CAM including instructions to Computer Numerical Control CNC machines Photorealistic rendering and Motion Simulation Document management and revision control using Product Data Management PDM CAD is also used for the accurate creation of photo simulations that are often required in the preparation of Environmental Impact Reports in which computer-aided designs of intended buildings are superimposed into photographs of existing environments to represent what that locale will be like where the proposed facilities are allowed to be built Potential blockage of view corridors and shadow studies are also frequently analyzed through the use of CAD CAD has been proven to be useful to engineers as well Using four properties which are history features parameterization and high-level constraints The construction history can be used to look back into the model's personal features and work on the single area rather than the whole model Parameters and constraints can be used to determine the size shape and other properties of the different modeling elements The features in the CAD system can be used for the variety of tools for measurement such as tensile strength yield strength electrical or electromagnetic properties Also its stress strain timing or how the element gets affected in certain temperatures etc Types edit A simple procedure   Comparison of computer-aided design editors There are several different types of CAD   each requiring the operator to think differently about how to use them and design their virtual components in a different manner for each There are many producers of the lower-end 2D systems including a number of free and open source programs These provide an approach to the drawing process without all the fuss over scale and placement on the drawing sheet that accompanied hand drafting since these can be adjusted as required during the creation of the final draft 3D wireframe is basically an extension of 2D drafting not often used today Each line has to be manually inserted into the drawing The final product has no mass properties associated with it and cannot have features directly added to it such as holes The operator approaches these in a similar fashion to the 2D systems although many 3D systems allow using the wireframe model to make the final engineering drawing views 3D \"dumb\" solids are created in a way analogous to manipulations of real-world objects not often used today Basic three-dimensional geometric forms prisms cylinders spheres and so on have solid volumes added or subtracted from them as if assembling or cutting real-world objects Two-dimensional projected views can easily be generated from the models Basic 3D solids don't usually include tools to easily allow motion of components set limits to their motion or identify interference between components There are two types of 3D Solid Modeling Parametric modeling allows the operator to use what is referred to as \"design intent\" The objects and features created are modifiable Any future modifications can be made by changing how the original part was created If a feature was intended to be located from the center of the part the operator should locate it from the center of the model The feature could be located using any geometric object already available in the part but this random placement would defeat the design intent If the operator designs the part as it functions the parametric modeler is able to make changes to the part while maintaining geometric and functional relationships Direct or Explicit modeling provide the ability to edit geometry without a history tree With direct modeling once a sketch is used to create geometry the sketch is incorporated into the new geometry and the designer just modifies the geometry without needing the original sketch As with parametric modeling direct modeling has the ability to include relationships between selected geometry e g tangency concentricity Top end systems offer the capabilities to incorporate more organic aesthetics and ergonomic features into designs Freeform surface modeling is often combined with solids to allow the designer to create products that fit the human form and visual requirements as well as they interface with the machine Technology edit A CAD model of a computer mouse Originally software for Computer-Aided Design systems was developed with computer languages such as Fortran ALGOL but with the advancement of object-oriented programming methods this has radically changed Typical modern parametric feature-based modeler and freeform surface systems are built around a number of key C modules with their own APIs A CAD system can be seen as built up from the interaction of a graphical user interface GUI with NURBS geometry or boundary representation B-rep data via a geometric modeling kernel A geometry constraint engine may also be employed to manage the associative relationships between geometry such as wireframe geometry in a sketch or components in an assembly Unexpected capabilities of these associative relationships have led to a new form of prototyping called digital prototyping In contrast to physical prototypes which entail manufacturing time in the design That said CAD models can be generated by a computer after the physical prototype has been scanned using an industrial CT scanning machine Depending on the nature of the business digital or physical prototypes can be initially chosen according to specific needs Today CAD systems exist for all the major platforms Windows Linux UNIX and Mac OS X some packages support multiple platforms Right now no special hardware is required for most CAD software However some CAD systems can do graphically and computationally intensive tasks so a modern graphics card high speed and possibly multiple CPUs and large amounts of RAM may be recommended The human-machine interface is generally via a computer mouse but can also be via a pen and digitizing graphics tablet Manipulation of the view of the model on the screen is also sometimes done with the use of a Spacemouse/SpaceBall Some systems also support stereoscopic glasses for viewing the 3D model Technologies which in the past were limited to larger installations or specialist applications have become available to a wide group of users These include the CAVE or HMDs and interactive devices like motion-sensing technology Software edit CAD software enables engineers and architects to design inspect and manage engineering projects within an integrated graphical user interface GUI on a personal computer system Most applications support solid modeling with boundary representation B-Rep and NURBS geometry and enable the same to be published in a variety of formats A geometric modeling kernel is a software component that provides solid modeling and surface modeling features to CAD applications Based on market statistics commercial software from Autodesk Dassault Systems Siemens PLM Software and PTC

used computers for their calculations         Digital computers were used in power system analysis or optimization as early as proto-\" Whirlwind \" in   Circuit   design theory or power network methodology would be algebraic symbolic and often vector -based Examples of problems being solved in the mid-1940s to 50s include servo motors controlled by generated pulse   a digital computer with built-in computer operations to automatically co-ordinate transforms to compute radar related vectors   and the essentially graphic mathematical process of forming a shape with a digital machine tool     These were accomplished with the use of computer software The man credited with coining the term CAD   Douglas T Ross stated \"As soon as I saw the interactive display equipment \" being used by radar operators   it would be just what his data reduction group needed With the Lincoln Lab people they were the only ones who used the big complex display systems put in for the pre-SAGE Cape Cod system But \"we used it for our own personal workstation \"   The designers of these very early computers built utility programs so that programmers could debug programs using flowcharts on a display scope with logical switches that could be opened and closed during the debugging session They found that they could create electronic symbols and geometric figures to be used to create simple circuit diagrams and flowcharts   They made the pleasant discovery that an object once drawn could be reproduced at will its orientation Linkage flux mechanical lexical scoping or scale changed This suggested numerous possibilities to them It took ten years of interdisciplinary development   work before SKETCHPAD sitting on evolving math libraries emerged from MIT's labs Additional developments were carried out in the 1960s within the aircraft automotive industrial control and electronics industries in the area of 3D surface construction NC programming and design analysis most of it independent of one another and often not publicly published until much later Some of the mathematical description work on curves was developed in the early 1940s by Robert Issac Newton from Pawtucket Rhode Island Robert A Heinlein in his   novel The Door into Summer suggested the possibility of a robotic Drafting Dan However probably the most important work on polynomial curves and sculptured surface was done by Pierre B zier Paul de Casteljau Citroen Steven Anson Coons MIT Ford James Ferguson Boeing Carl de Boor GM Birkhoff GM and Garibedian GM in the 1960s and W Gordon GM and R Riesenfeld in the 1970s The invention of the 3D CAD/CAM is attributed to a French engineer Pierre B zier Arts et M tiers ParisTech Renault After his mathematical work concerning surfaces he developed UNISURF between   and   to ease the design of parts and tools for the automotive industry Then UNISURF became the working base for the following generations of CAD software It is argued by whom? that a turning point was the development of the SKETCHPAD system at MIT     by Ivan Sutherland who later created a graphics technology company with David Evans The distinctive feature of SKETCHPAD was that it allowed the designer to interact with his computer graphically the design can be fed into the computer by drawing on a CRT monitor with a light pen Effectively it was a prototype of graphical user interface an indispensable feature of modern CAD Sutherland presented his paper Sketchpad A Man-Machine Graphical Communication System in   at a Joint Computer Conference having worked on it as his PhD thesis paper for a few years Quoting \"For drawings where motion of the drawing or analysis of a drawn problem is of value to the user Sketchpad excels For highly repetitive drawings or drawings where accuracy is required Sketchpad is sufficiently faster than conventional techniques to be worthwhile For drawings which merely communicate with shops it is probably better to use conventional paper and pencil \" Over time efforts would be directed toward the goal of having the designers drawings communicate not just with shops but with the shop tool itself This goal would be a long time arriving The first commercial applications of CAD were in large companies in the automotive and aerospace industries as well as in electronics Only large corporations could afford the computers capable of performing the calculations Notable company projects were a joint project of GM Patrick J Hanratty and IBM Sam Matsa Doug Ross's MIT APT research assistant to develop a prototype system for design engineers DAC-1 Design Augmented by Computer   Lockheed projects Bell GRAPHIC   and Renault One of the most influential events in the development of CAD was the founding of MCS Manufacturing and Consulting Services Inc in   by Patrick J Hanratty   who wrote the system ADAM Automated Drafting And Machining but more importantly supplied code to companies such as McDonnell Douglas Unigraphics Computervision CADDS Calma Gerber Autotrol and Control Data As computers became more affordable the application areas have gradually expanded The development of CAD software for personal desktop computers was the impetus for almost universal application in all areas of construction Other key points in the 1960s and 1970s would be the foundation of CAD systems United Computing Intergraph IBM Intergraph IGDS in   which led to Bentley Systems MicroStation in   CAD implementations have evolved dramatically since then Initially with 3D in the 1970s it was typically limited to producing drawings similar to hand-drafted drawings Advances in programming and computer hardware     notably solid modeling in the 1980s have allowed more versatile applications of computers in design activities Key products for   were the solid modeling packages - Romulus ShapeData and Uni-Solid Unigraphics based on PADL-2 and the release of the surface modeler CATIA Dassault Systemes Autodesk was founded   by John Walker which led to the 2D system AutoCAD The next milestone was the release of Pro/ENGINEER in   which heralded greater usage of feature-based modeling methods and parametric linking of the parameters of features Also of importance to the development of CAD was the development of the B-rep solid modeling kernels engines for manipulating geometrically and topologically consistent 3D objects Parasolid ShapeData and ACIS Spatial Technology Inc at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s both inspired by the work of Ian Braid This led to the release of mid-range packages such as SolidWorks and TriSpective later known as IRONCAD in   Solid Edge then Intergraph in   and Autodesk Inventor in   An independent geometric modeling kernel has been evolving in Russia

information History of free and open source software End of 1990s Foundation of the Open Source Initiative In the early days of computing programmers and developers shared software in order to learn from each other and evolve the field of computing Eventually the open source notion moved to the way side of commercialization of software in the years 1970-1980 However academics still often developed software collaboratively for example Donald Knuth in   with the TeX typesetting system   or Richard Stallman in   with the GNU operating system In   Eric Raymond published The Cathedral and the Bazaar a reflective analysis of the hacker community and free software principles The paper received significant attention in early   and was one factor in motivating Netscape Communications Corporation to release their popular Netscape Communicator Internet suite as free software This source code subsequently became the basis behind SeaMonkey Mozilla Firefox Thunderbird and KompoZer Netscape's act prompted Raymond and others to look into how to bring the Free Software Foundation 's free software ideas and perceived benefits to the commercial software industry They concluded that FSF's social activism was not appealing to companies like Netscape and looked for a way to rebrand the free software movement to emphasize the business potential of sharing and collaborating on software source code   The new term they chose was \"open source\" which was soon adopted by Bruce Perens publisher Tim O'Reilly Linus Torvalds and others The Open Source Initiative was founded in February   to encourage use of the new term and evangelize open-source principles   While the Open Source Initiative sought to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize the principles it adhered to commercial software vendors found themselves increasingly threatened by the concept of freely distributed software and universal access to an application's source code A Microsoft executive publicly stated in   that \"open source is an intellectual property destroyer I can't imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual-property business \"   However while Free and open-source software has historically played a role outside of the mainstream of private software development companies as large as Microsoft have begun to develop official open-source presences on the Internet IBM Oracle Google and State Farm are just a few of the companies with a serious public stake in today's competitive open-source market There has been a significant shift in the corporate philosophy concerning the development of FOSS   The free software movement was launched in   In   a group of individuals advocated that the term free software should be replaced by open-source software OSS as an expression which is less ambiguous       and more comfortable for the corporate world   Software developers may want to publish their software with an open-source license so that anybody may also develop the same software or understand its internal functioning With open-source software generally anyone is allowed to create modifications of it port it to new operating systems and instruction set architectures share it with others or in some cases market it Scholars Casson and Ryan have pointed out several policy-based reasons for adoption of open source in particular the heightened value proposition from open source when compared to most proprietary formats in the following categories Security Affordability Transparency Perpetuity Interoperability Flexibility Localization particularly in the context of local governments who make software decisions Casson and Ryan argue that \"governments have an inherent responsibility and fiduciary duty to taxpayers\" which includes the careful analysis of these factors when deciding to purchase proprietary software or implement an open-source option   The Open Source Definition notably presents an open-source philosophy and further defines the terms of use modification and redistribution of open-source software Software licenses grant rights to users which would otherwise be reserved by copyright law to the copyright holder Several open-source software licenses have qualified within the boundaries of the Open Source Definition The most prominent and popular example is the GNU General Public License GPL which \"allows free distribution under the condition that further developments and applications are put under the same licence\" thus also free   The open source label came out of a strategy session held on April     in Palo Alto in reaction to Netscape's January   announcement of a source code release for Navigator as Mozilla A group of individuals at the session included Tim O'Reilly Linus Torvalds Tom Paquin Jamie Zawinski Larry Wall Brian Behlendorf Sameer Parekh Eric Allman Greg Olson Paul Vixie John Ousterhout Guido van Rossum Philip Zimmermann John Gilmore and Eric S Raymond   They used the opportunity before the release of Navigator's source code to clarify a potential confusion caused by the ambiguity of the word \"free\" in English Many people claimed that the birth of the Internet since   started the open source movement while others do not distinguish between open-source and free software movements   The Free Software Foundation FSF started in   intended the word \"free\" to mean freedom to distribute or \"free as in free speech\" and not freedom from cost or \"free as in free beer\" Since a great deal of free software already was and still is free of charge such free software became associated with zero cost which seemed anti-commercial   The Open Source Initiative OSI was formed in February   by Eric Raymond and Bruce Perens With at least   years of evidence from case histories of closed software development versus open development already provided by the Internet developer community the OSI presented the \"open source\" case to commercial businesses like Netscape The OSI hoped that the use of the label \"open source\" a term suggested by Christine Peterson of the Foresight Institute at the strategy session would eliminate ambiguity particularly for individuals who perceive \"free software\" as anti-commercial They sought to bring a higher profile to the practical benefits of freely available source code and they wanted to bring major software businesses and other high-tech industries into open source Perens attempted to register \"open source\" as a service mark for the OSI but that attempt was impractical by trademark standards Meanwhile due to the presentation of Raymond's paper to the upper management at Netscape Raymond only discovered when he read the press release   and was called by Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale 's PA later in the day Netscape released its Navigator source code as open source with favorable results   Definitions The logo of the Open Source Initiative The Open Source Initiative 's OSI definition is recognized by governments internationally   as the standard or de facto definition In addition many of the world's largest open source software projects and contributors including Debian Drupal Association FreeBSD Foundation Linux Foundation Mozilla Foundation Wikimedia Foundation Wordpress Foundation have committed   to upholding the OSI's mission and Open Source Definition through the OSI Affiliate Agreement   OSI uses The Open Source Definition to determine whether it considers a software license open source The definition was based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines written and adapted primarily by Perens       Perens did not base his writing on the \"four freedoms\" from the Free Software Foundation FSF which were only widely available later   Under Perens' definition open source describes a broad general type of software license that makes source code available to the general public with relaxed or non-existent restrictions on the use and modification of the code It is an explicit \"feature\" of open source that it puts very few restrictions on the use or distribution by any organization or user in order to enable the rapid evolution of the software   Despite initially accepting it   Richard Stallman of the FSF now flatly opposes the term \"Open Source\" being applied to what they refer to as \"free software\" Although he agrees that the two terms describe \"almost the same category of software\" Stallman considers equating the terms incorrect and misleading   Stallman also opposes the professed pragmatism of the Open Source Initiative as he fears that the free software ideals of freedom and community are threatened by compromising on the FSF's idealistic standards for software freedom   The FSF considers free software to be a subset of open source software and Richard Stallman explained that DRM software for example can be developed as open source despite that it does not give its users freedom it restricts them and thus doesn't qualify as free software   Open-source software licensing   Open-source license Further information Free software license   Free and open-source software Licensing and Software license When an author contributes code to an open-source project e g Apache org they do so under an explicit license e g the Apache Contributor License Agreement or an implicit license e g the open-source license under which the project is already licensing code Some open-source projects do not take contributed code under a license but actually require joint assignment of the author's copyright in order to accept code contributions into the project   Examples of free software license / open-source licenses include Apache License BSD license GNU General Public License GNU Lesser General Public License MIT License Eclipse Public License and Mozilla Public License The proliferation of open-source licenses is a negative aspect of the open-source movement because it is often difficult to understand the legal implications of the differences between licenses With more than     open-source projects available and more than   unique licenses the complexity of deciding how to manage open-source use within \"closed-source\" commercial enterprises has dramatically increased Some are home-grown while others are modeled after mainstream FOSS licenses such as Berkeley Software Distribution \"BSD\" Apache MIT-style Massachusetts Institute of Technology or GNU General Public License \"GPL\" In view of this open-source practitioners are starting to use classification schemes in which FOSS licenses are grouped typically based on the existence and obligations imposed by the copyleft provision the strength of the copyleft provision   An important legal milestone for the open source / free software movement was passed in   when the US federal appeals court ruled that free software licenses definitely do set legally binding conditions on the use of copyrighted work and they are therefore enforceable under existing copyright law As a result if end-users violate the licensing conditions their license disappears meaning they are infringing copyright   Despite this licensing risk most commercial software vendors are using open source software in commercial products while fulfilling the license terms e g leveraging the Apache license   Certifications Certification can help to build user confidence Certification could be applied to the simplest component to a whole software system The United Nations University International Institute for Software Technology   initiated a project known as \"The Global Desktop Project\" This project aims to build a desktop interface that every end-user is able to understand and interact with thus crossing the language and cultural barriers The project would improve developing nations' access to information systems UNU/IIST hopes to achieve this without any compromise in the quality of the software by introducing certifications   Open-source software development   Open-source software development model Development model In his   essay The Cathedral and the Bazaar   open-source evangelist Eric S Raymond suggests a model for developing OSS known as the bazaar model Raymond likens the development of software by traditional methodologies to building a cathedral \"carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation\"   He suggests that all software should be developed using the bazaar style which he described as \"a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches \"   In the traditional model of development which he called the cathedral model development takes place in a centralized way Roles are clearly defined Roles include people dedicated to designing the architects people responsible for managing the project and people responsible for implementation Traditional software engineering follows the cathedral model The bazaar model however is different In this model roles are not clearly defined Gregorio Robles   suggests that software developed using the bazaar model should exhibit the following patterns Users should be treated as co-developers The users are treated like co-developers and so they should have access to the source code of the software Furthermore users are encouraged to submit additions to the software code fixes for the software bug reports documentation etc Having more co-developers increases the rate at which the software evolves Linus's law states \"Given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow \" This means that if many users view the source code they will eventually find all bugs and suggest how to fix them Note that some users have advanced programming skills and furthermore each user's machine provides an additional testing environment This new testing environment offers that ability to find and fix a new bug Early releases The first version of the software should be released as early as possible so as to increase one's chances of finding co-developers early Frequent integration Code changes should be integrated merged into a shared code base as often as possible so as to avoid the overhead of fixing a large number of bugs at the end of the project life cycle Some open source projects have nightly builds where integration is done automatically on a daily basis Several versions There should be at least two versions of the software There should be a buggier version with more features and a more stable version with fewer features The buggy version also called the development version is for users who want the immediate use of the latest features and are willing to accept the risk of using code that is not yet thoroughly tested The users can then act as co-developers reporting bugs and providing bug fixes High modularization The general structure of the software should be modular allowing for parallel development on independent components Dynamic decision making structure There is a need for a decision making structure whether formal or informal that makes strategic decisions depending on changing user requirements and other factors Compare with extreme programming Data suggests however that OSS is not quite as democratic as the bazaar model suggests An analysis of five billion bytes of free/open source code by     developers shows that 74% of the code was written by the most active 10% of authors The average number of authors involved in a project was     with the median at     Advantages and disadvantages Open source software is usually easier to obtain than proprietary software often resulting in increased use Additionally the availability of an open source implementation of a standard can increase adoption of that standard   It has also helped to build developer loyalty as developers feel empowered and have a sense of ownership of the end product   Moreover lower costs of marketing and logistical services are needed for OSS OSS also helps companies keep abreast of technology developments It is a good tool to promote a company's image including its commercial products   The OSS development approach has helped produce reliable high quality software quickly and inexpensively   Open source development offers the potential for a more flexible technology and quicker innovation It is said to be more reliable since it typically has thousands of independent programmers testing and fixing bugs of the software Open source is not dependent on the company or author that originally created it Even if the company fails the code continues to exist and be developed by its users Also it uses open standards accessible to everyone thus it does not have the problem of incompatible formats that exist in proprietary software It is flexible because modular systems allow programmers to build custom interfaces or add new abilities to it and it is innovative since open source programs are the product of collaboration among a large number of different programmers The mix of divergent perspectives corporate objectives and personal goals speeds up innovation   Moreover free software can be developed in accord with purely technical requirements It does not require thinking about commercial pressure that often degrades the quality of the software Commercial pressures make traditional software developers pay more attention to customers' requirements than to security requirements since such features are somewhat invisible to the customer   It is sometimes said that the open source development process may not be well defined and the stages in the development process such as system testing and documentation may be ignored However this is only true for small mostly single programmer projects Larger successful projects do define and enforce at least some rules as they need them to make the teamwork possible     In the most complex projects these rules may be as strict as reviewing even minor change by two independent developers   Not all OSS initiatives have been successful for example SourceXchange and Eazel   Software experts and researchers who are not convinced by open source's ability to produce quality systems identify the unclear process the late defect discovery and the lack of any empirical evidence as the most important problems collected data concerning productivity and quality   It is also difficult to design a commercially sound business model around the open source paradigm Consequently only technical requirements may be satisfied and not the ones of the market   In terms of security open source may allow hackers to know about the weaknesses or loopholes of the software more easily than closed-source software It depends on control mechanisms in order to create effective performance of autonomous agents who participate in virtual organizations   Development tools In OSS development tools are used to support the development of the product and the development process itself   Revision control systems such as Concurrent Versions System CVS and later Subversion SVN and Git are examples of tools often themselves open source help manage the source code files and the changes to those files for a software project   The projects are frequently hosted and published on sites like Launchpad Bitbucket and GitHub   Open source projects are often loosely organized with \"little formalised process modelling or support\" but utilities such as issue trackers are often used to organize open source software development   Commonly used bugtrackers include Bugzilla and Redmine   Tools such as mailing lists and IRC provide means of coordination among developers   Centralized code hosting sites also have social features that allow developers to communicate   Organizations Some of the \"more prominent organizations\" involved in OSS development include the Apache Software Foundation creators of the Apache web server the Linux Foundation a nonprofit which as of   update employed Linus Torvalds the creator of the Linux operating system kernel the Eclipse Foundation home of the Eclipse software development platform the Debian Project creators of the influential Debian GNU/Linux distribution the Mozilla Foundation home of the Firefox web browser and OW2 European-born community developing open source middleware New organizations tend to have a more sophisticated governance model and their membership is often formed by legal entity members   Open Source Software Institute is a membership-based non-profit   c   organization established in   that promotes the development and implementation of open source software solutions within US Federal state and local government agencies OSSI's efforts have focused on promoting adoption of open source software programs and policies within Federal Government and Defense and Homeland Security communities   Open Source for America is a group created to raise awareness in the United States Federal Government about the benefits of open source software Their stated goals are to encourage the government's use of open source software participation in open source software projects and incorporation of open source community dynamics to increase government transparency   Mil-OSS is a group dedicated to the advancement of OSS use and creation in the military   Funding   Business models for open-source software Open-source software is widely used both as independent applications and as components in non-open-source applications Many independent software vendors ISVs value-added resellers VARs and hardware vendors OEMs or ODMs use open-source frameworks modules and libraries inside their proprietary for-profit products and services   From a customer's perspective the ability to use open technology under standard commercial terms and support is valuable They are willing to pay for the legal protection e g indemnification from copyright or patent infringement \"commercial-grade QA\" and professional support/training/consulting that are typical of commercial software while also receiving the benefits of fine-grained control and lack of lock-in that comes with open-source Comparisons with other software licensing/development models Closed source / proprietary software   Comparison of open source and closed source The debate over open source vs closed source alternatively called proprietary software is sometimes heated The top four reasons as provided by Open Source Business Conference survey   individuals or organizations choose open source software are lower cost security no vendor 'lock in' better quality Since innovative companies no longer rely heavily on software sales proprietary software has become less of a necessity   As such things like open source content management system or CMS deployments are becoming more commonplace In     the US White House switched its CMS system from a proprietary system to Drupal open source CMS Further companies like Novell who traditionally sold software the old-fashioned way continually debate the benefits of switching to open source availability having already switched part of the product offering to open source code   In this way open source software provides solutions to unique or specific problems As such it is reported   that 98% of enterprise-level companies use open source software offerings in some capacity With this market shift more critical systems are beginning to rely on open source offerings   allowing greater funding such as US Department of Homeland Security grants   to help \"hunt for security bugs \" According to a pilot study of organizations adopting or not adopting OSS the following factors of statistical significance were observed in the manager's beliefs a attitudes toward outcomes b the influences and behaviors of others and c their ability to act   Proprietary source distributors have started to develop and contribute to the open source community due to the market share shift doing so by the need to reinvent their models in order to remain competitive   Many advocates argue that open source software is inherently safer because any person can view edit and change code   A study of the Linux source code has     bugs per   lines of code while proprietary software generally scores     bugs per   lines   Free software   Alternative terms for free software   Comparison of free and open-source software licenses According to the Free software movement 's leader Richard Stallman the main difference is that by choosing one term over the other i e either \"open source\" or \" free software \" one lets others know about what one's goals are \"Open source is a development methodology free software is a social movement \"   Nevertheless there is significant overlap between open source software and free software   The FSF   said that the term \"open source\" fosters an ambiguity of a different kind such that it confuses the mere availability of the source with the freedom to use modify and redistribute it On the other hand the \"free software\" term was criticized for the ambiguity of the word \"free\" as \"available at no cost\" which was seen as discouraging for business adoption   and for the historical ambiguous usage of the term       Developers have used the alternative terms Free and Open Source Software FOSS or Free/Libre and Open Source Software FLOSS consequently to describe open source software that is also free software   While the definition of open source software is very similar to the FSF's free software definition   it was based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines written and adapted primarily by Bruce Perens with input from Eric S Raymond and others   The term \"open source\" was originally intended to be trademarkable however the term was deemed too descriptive so no trademark exists   The OSI would prefer that people treat open source as if it were a trademark and use it only to describe software licensed under an OSI approved license   OSI Certified is a trademark licensed only to people who are distributing software licensed under a license listed on the Open Source Initiative's list   Open-source versus source-available It has been suggested that this section be merged into shared source Discuss Proposed since March   Although the OSI definition of \"open source software\" is widely accepted a small number of people and organizations use the term to refer to software where the source is available for viewing but which may not legally be modified or redistributed Such software is more often referred to as source-available or as shared source a term coined by Microsoft in     While in   two shared source licenses were certified by the OSI most of the shared source licenses are still source-available only   In   Michael Tiemann president of OSI had criticized   companies such as SugarCRM for promoting their software as \"open source\" when in fact it did not have an OSI-approved license In SugarCRM's case it was because the software is so-called \" badgeware \"   since it specified a \"badge\" that must be displayed in the user interface SugarCRM has since switched to GPLv3   Another example was Scilab prior to version   which called itself \"the open source platform for numerical computation\"   but had a license   that forbade commercial redistribution of modified versions Open-sourcing Open-sourcing is the act of propagating the open source movement most often referring to releasing previously proprietary software under an open source / free software license   but it may also refer programing Open Source software or installing Open Source software Notable software packages previously proprietary which have been open sourced include Netscape Navigator the code of which became the basis of the Mozilla and Mozilla Firefox web browsers StarOffice which became the base of the OpenOffice org office suite and LibreOffice Global File System was originally GPL'd then made proprietary in   ? but in   was re-GPL'd SAP DB which has become MaxDB and is now distributed and owned by MySQL AB InterBase database which was open sourced by Borland in   and presently exists as a commercial product and an open-source fork Firebird Before changing the license of software distributors usually audit the source code for third party licensed code which they would have to remove or obtain permission for its relicense Backdoors and other malware should also be removed as they may easily be discovered after release of the code Current applications and adoption   Free and open-source software Adoption   Linux adoption and Free software Adoption \"We migrated key functions from Windows to Linux because we needed an operating system that was stable and reliable one that would give us in-house control So if we needed to patch adjust or adapt we could \" Official statement of the United Space Alliance which manages the computer systems for the International Space Station ISS regarding why they chose to switch from Windows to Debian GNU/Linux on the ISS     Widely used open-source software   List of free and open-source software packages Open source software projects are built and maintained by a network of volunteer programmers and are widely used in free as well as commercial products   Prime examples of open-source products are the Apache HTTP Server the e-commerce platform osCommerce internet browsers Mozilla Firefox and Chromium the project where the vast majority of development of the freeware Google Chrome is done and the full office suite LibreOffice One of the most successful open-source products is the GNU/Linux operating system an open-source Unix-like operating system and its derivative Android an operating system for mobile devices     In some industries open source software is the norm   Extensions for non-software use   Open source model   Open content and Open collaboration While the term \"open source\" applied originally only to the source code of software   it is now being applied to many other areas   such as Open source ecology   a movement to decentralize technologies so that any human can use them However it is often misapplied to other areas which have different and competing principles which overlap only partially The same principles that underlie open source software can be found in many other ventures such as open-source hardware Wikipedia and open-access publishing Collectively these principles are known as open source open content and open collaboration   \"any system of innovation or production that relies on goal-oriented yet loosely coordinated participants who interact to create a product or service of economic value which they make available to contributors and non-contributors alike \"   This \"culture\" or ideology takes the view that the principles apply more generally to facilitate concurrent input of different agendas approaches and priorities in contrast with more centralized models of development such as those typically used in commercial companies     Open-source software portal Free software

search Open Manufacturing or \"Open Production\" or \"Design Global Manufacture Local\" is a new model of socioeconomic production in which physical objects are produced in an open collaborative and

printers new value-based movements such as the maker movement new institutions and networks for manufacturing and production such as FabLabs and open source methods software and protocols     Open manufacturing may also include digital modeling and fabrication and computer numeric control CNC of the machines used for production through open source software and open source hardware The philosophy of open manufacturing is close to the open-source movement but aims at the development of physical products rather than software   The term is linked to the notion of democratizing technology   as embodied in the Maker culture the DIY ethic the open source appropriate technology movement the Fablab-network and other rooms for grassroot innovation such as hackerspaces According to scholar Michel Bauwens Open Manufacturing is \"the expansion of peer production to the world of physical production\"   Redlich and Bruns define \"Open Production\" as \"a new form of coordination

that open production through 3D-printing \"will eventually and inevitably reduce marginal costs to near zero eliminate profit and make property exchange in markets unnecessary for many though not all products\"   Socioeconomic implications edit The following points are seen as key implications of open manufacturing   a democratization of the means of production a decentralization of production and local value creation global cooperation local manufacturing the possibility to produce high quality prototypes and products in small quantities at moderate to increasingly low prices the closing of the gap between the formal and informal sector and opportunities for bottom-up open innovation and a transition from consumer to producer for manufactured goods In the context of socioeconomic development open manufacturing has been described as a path towards a more sustainable industrialization on a global scale that promotes \"social sustainability\" and provides the opportunity to shift to a \"collaboration-oriented industrialization driven by stakeholders from countries with different development status connected in a global value creation at eye level\"   For developing countries open production could notably lead to products more adapted to local problems and local markets and reduce dependencies on foreign goods as vital products could be manufactured locally   In such a context open manufacturing is strongly linked to the broader concept of Open Source Appropriate Technology movement Criticism edit A number of factors are seen to hamper the broad-based application of the model of \"open manufacturing\" and / or to realize its positive implications for more sustainable global production pattern The first factor is the sustainability of commons-based peer production models \"Empowerment happens only if the participants are willing to share their knowledge with their colleagues The participation of the actors cannot be guaranteed thus there are many cases known where participation could only be insufficiently realized\"   Other problems include missing or inadequate systems of quality control the persistent paradigm of high-volume manufacturing and its cost-efficiency the lack of widely adopted platforms to share hardware designs as well as challenges linked to the joint-ownership paradigm behind the open licences of open manufacturing and the fact that hardware is much more difficult to share and to standardize than e g software   In developing countries a number of factors need to be considered in addition to the points above Scholar
